Journal of International Economics,Responses of exporters to trade protectionism: Inferences from the US-China trade war,"['Jiang, Lingduo', 'Lu, Yi', 'Song, Hong', 'Zhang, Guofeng']","This paper investigates how exports respond to trade protection by studying the US-China trade war in 2018. Using monthly customs data in China from January 2017 to May 2019, we find that the launch of the trade war against Chinese exports by the US on average reduces Chinese total exports to the US by 16.47%. Further decomposition shows that the reduction in exports is mostly explained by a decrease in quantity, with prices relatively unchanged. Meanwhile, negative trade shocks cause export diversion to countries that are closer and have larger economies, and exports in R&D-intensive, skilled-labor-intensive, high-capital-income-share, and upstream industries have been diverted even more. Heterogeneous analyses show that industries with a comparative advantage, high export growth, large export value, and high elasticity of substitution are more responsive to trade protection.","Jiang, Lingduo & Lu, Yi & Song, Hong & Zhang, Guofeng, 2023.

Journal of International Economics,Third-country effects of regional trade agreements: A firm-level analysis,"['Lee, Woori', 'Mulabdic, Alen', 'Ruta, Michele']","How do regional trade agreements impact exporters in non-member countries? We revisit this long-standing trade policy question using firm-level data from Costa Rica and detailed information on the content of trade agreements. Differently from the conventional view on trade diversion, the analysis shows that “deep” regional trade agreements can have a positive spillover effect: they increase the probability of export and entry of third-country firms that previously exported to one of the member countries. This spillover effect is driven by provisions that are nondiscriminatory and address regulatory issues, as they make member countries more “similar”, thus allowing to reduce entry costs. Indeed, firms exporting regulation-intensive products benefit disproportionately more from deep trade agreements in destination markets.","Lee, Woori & Mulabdic, Alen & Ruta, Michele, 2023.

Journal of International Economics,"Sovereign bond prices, haircuts and maturity","['Asonuma, Tamon', 'Niepelt, Dirk', 'Ranciere, Romain']","We document that creditor losses (“haircuts”) during sovereign debt restructurings vary across debt maturity. In our novel dataset on instrument-specific haircuts suffered by private creditors in 1999–2020 we find larger losses on short- than long-term debt, independently of the specific haircut measure we use. A standard asset pricing model rationalizes our findings under two assumptions, both of which are satisfied in the data: increasing short-run restructuring risk in the run-up to a restructuring, and high exit yields.

Journal of International Economics,Import substitution in illicit methamphetamine markets,"['Freylejer, Leandro', 'Orr, Scott']","The United States passed a series of precursor control laws between 2004 and 2006 which aimed to decrease illicit methamphetamine production by limiting access to key inputs. We provide evidence that this caused suppliers to substitute towards Mexican-produced methamphetamine. Using a difference-in-differences identification strategy, we show that the treatment effect of precursor controls on lab seizures was largest in the middle of the United States. This is consistent with substitution towards imports, where differences in each region's ability to substitute towards imports generates heterogeneous effects on domestic production. To quantify the effect of precursor controls on domestic costs and imports, we estimate a model of illicit methamphetamine production using data on lab seizures and methamphetamine prices. We find that precursor controls increased domestic costs by 114%–190%. Substitution towards Mexican-produced methamphetamine decreased the effect of precursor controls on methamphetamine prices by 62%–83%, relative to a counterfactual world without import substitution.","Freylejer, Leandro & Orr, Scott, 2023.

The ELB is an interest rate threshold below which monetary easing becomes contractionary because of adverse effects on credit supply. A tightening in global monetary and financial conditions increases the ELB and may force central banks to hike rates even though domestic economic activity contracts. We also show that the ELB gives rise to a novel inter-temporal trade-off for monetary policy and calls for using a broad range of policy tools to restore monetary transmission.","Cavallino, Paolo & Sandri, Damiano, 2023.

Journal of International Economics,Trade intermediation by producers,"['Erbahar, Aksel', 'Rebeyrol, Vincent']","This paper shows that manufacturing exporters export goods that they have not produced and thus also act as trade intermediaries. The geographical dimension of the data reveals that almost half of these exports of “sourced” products are purely intermediated: to many destinations, firms export sourced products only. We find that this type of intermediation is ubiquitous across firms, products, and destinations, and is robust to a battery of alternative definitions. These findings show that trade intermediation by producers (TIP) is not solely driven by carry-along trade, where produced and sourced products are bundled when exported. Our decomposition of TIP highlights that trade intermediation should be identified at the firm-product-destination level. The prevalence of pure intermediation for all manufacturing exporters, including the largest ones, suggests that intermediation plays an important role in firms' participation and success in international markets.","Erbahar, Aksel & Rebeyrol, Vincent, 2023.

Journal of International Economics,"Migration, tariffs, and China's export surge","['Liu, Chen', 'Ma, Xiao']","We build a multi-sector spatial general equilibrium model that features heterogeneous firms' and workers' location choices to account for China's export surge between 1990 and 2005 using three policy changes: China's import tariffs, tariffs imposed against China's exports, and barriers to internal migration in China. We find that tariff and migration policies jointly accounted for 30% of China's export growth. We also find evidence that suggests a positive interaction effect of tariff and migration policies. As migration reform prepared the country to become more export oriented, China enjoyed faster export growth after opening to trade than it would have otherwise.","Liu, Chen & Ma, Xiao, 2023.

Journal of International Economics,Endogenous product adjustment and exchange rate pass-through,"['Freitag, Andreas', 'Lein, Sarah M.']","We document how product quality responds to exchange rate movements and quantify the extent to which these quality changes affect the aggregate pass-through into export prices. We analyze the substantial sudden appreciation of the Swiss franc post removal of the 1.20-CHF-per-euro lower bound in 2015 using export data representing a large share of the universe of goods exports from Switzerland. We find that firms upgrade the quality of their products after the appreciation. Furthermore, they disproportionately remove lower-quality products from their product ranges. This quality upgrading and quality sorting effect accounts for a substantial share of the total pass-through one year after the appreciation. We cross-check our results with the microdata underlying the Swiss export price index, which includes an adjustment factor for quality based on firms' reported product replacements, and obtain similar results.","Freitag, Andreas & Lein, Sarah M., 2023.

Journal of International Economics,The rise in foreign currency bonds: The role of US monetary policy and capital controls,"['Bacchetta, Philippe', 'Cordonier, Rachel', 'Merrouche, Ouarda']","An unintended consequence of loose US monetary policy is the increase in currency risk exposure abroad. Using firm-level data on corporate bond issuances in 16 emerging market economies (EMEs) between 2003 and 2017, we find that EME companies are more likely to issue bonds in foreign currency when US interest rates are low. This effect is driven by non-exporters. Interestingly, capital controls on bond inflows significantly decrease the likelihood of issuing in foreign currency and can even eliminate the adverse impact of low US interest rates. In contrast, macroprudential foreign exchange regulations increase foreign currency issuances among nonfinancial companies.","Bacchetta, Philippe & Cordonier, Rachel & Merrouche, Ouarda, 2023.

The literature tackled them separately: i) strategic complementarities for exporting firms to mitigate the pass-through to consumer prices and ii) intermediate inputs trade to enhance cross-border spillovers. We prove that foreign intermediate inputs also efficiently address the pass-through dimension, but, unlike strategic complementarities, solve the exchange rate pass-through disconnect puzzle. These results carry over to the general equilibrium effects of a depreciation. Furthermore, we show analytically that both types of vertical integration weaken sharply the expenditure switching effect. This feature strengthens real synchronization in response to productivity and monetary policy shocks, but lowers it in response to private demand shocks, a point which complements the existing literature.","de Walque, Gregory & Lejeune, Thomas & Rannenberg, Ansgar & Wouters, Raf, 2023.

Journal of International Economics,MPCs in an emerging economy: Evidence from Peru,"['Hong, Seungki']","This paper estimates the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of transitory income shocks for an emerging economy, Peru, using its nationally representative household survey. The mean quarterly MPC across Peruvian income deciles is 0.204, which translates to a mean annualized MPC of 0.545–0.592 under both model-free and model-based annualization methods. To compare Peruvian and U.S. MPCs reflecting the different reference periods of the underlying surveys, I employ a standard incomplete-market model. Two striking differences emerge. First, the mean annual MPC in Peru is three times as large as that in the U.S. Second, the MPCs are substantially more heterogeneous over income deciles in Peru than in the U.S. The model predicts that precautionary saving behavior drives both the higher mean MPC and stronger MPC heterogeneity in Peru.","Hong, Seungki, 2023.

Using data on FX transactions with a precise identification of Algorithmic trading (AT), we find that AT, broadly defined, appears to have contributed to the deterioration of market quality following the removal of the cap on the Swiss franc on 15 January 2015 by withdrawing liquidity and generating uninformative volatility. We also find that the Swiss National Bank, after initially stepping aside, played an important role, though more by signalling rather than trading.

Journal of International Economics,Intellectual property infringement by foreign firms: Import protection through the ITC or court,"['Brander, James A.', 'Spencer, Barbara J.']","This paper examines intellectual property litigation as a method of protection from patent-infringing imports. Claims against patent-infringing imports entering the United States may be filed before the International Trade Commission (ITC) or in district court. The ITC applies injunctions (import prohibitions) that would seem to provide more protection from infringing imports than the standard license fee remedy in court. Settlements prior to legal adjudication are common in both venues. Using a model with Nash bargaining and Cournot competition, we show that an ITC filing may restrict imports by less than in court. This result tends to apply if product differentiation is high and the size of the patented cost-reducing innovation is large.","Brander, James A. & Spencer, Barbara J., 2023.

In this paper we explore whether the form of accumulation affects country risk. We first present a model of endogenous sovereign debt defaults, where we show that reserve accumulation through the issuance of debt contingent on local output reduces spreads in a way that reserve accumulation with foreign borrowing does not. We confirm this model prediction when taking the theory to the data. These results suggest that attention should be placed on the way reserves are accumulated, a distinction that has important practical implications. In particular, our results call into question the benefits of programs of reserves strengthening through external debt such as those typically implemented by multilateral organizations.","Sosa-Padilla, César & Sturzenegger, Federico, 2023.

Journal of International Economics,Productivity and trade dynamics in sudden stops,"['Benguria, Felipe', 'Matsumoto, Hidehiko', 'Saffie, Felipe']","This paper proposes a framework to jointly study productivity and trade dynamics during financial crises. The persistent output loss caused by crises is driven by lower productivity growth, which is determined by changes in product entry and exit margins in domestic and export markets. We calibrate and validate the model using unique data on firms’ product portfolios, finding they closely match the behavior of various margins during Chile's 1998 sudden stop. We decompose the sources of the welfare cost of sudden stops, finding that 30% is due to a decline in productivity growth. Lower productivity growth, in turn, is due mostly to slower firm and product entry into the domestic market, while a persistent real exchange rate depreciation induces surviving firms to tilt their product portfolios toward export markets, driving the productivity recovery in the aftermath of the crisis.","Benguria, Felipe & Matsumoto, Hidehiko & Saffie, Felipe, 2022.

To correctly identify innovations in changes in legal reserve requirements, we develop a narrative approach that classifies each change into endogenous or exogenous to the business cycle. We show that this distinction is critical in understanding the macroeconomic effects of reserve requirements. In particular, we show that output falls in response to exogenous increases in legal reserve requirements but is not affected when using all changes and relying on traditional time-identifying strategies. This bias reflects the practical relevance of the misidentification of endogenous countercyclical changes in reserve requirements.","Rojas, Diego & Vegh, Carlos & Vuletin, Guillermo, 2022.

We first re-confirm that the real exchange rate appreciates when external asset holdings increase, all else equal, a central mechanism in international economics. However, we find that increases in publicly held external assets (reserves) are associated with depreciation, especially if combined with high capital controls. Reserve accumulation is also associated with a larger trade surplus, and higher GDP and TFP growth, in countries with high capital controls. The results hold using an instrumental variable for reserves based on commodity export surrender requirements. A simple rationale is presented to account for the new fact: combined reserves and capital controls can affect trade balances via undervaluation (mercantilist motive), while reserve increases without controls can insure against crises (precautionary motive) independently of real exchange rates.","Choi, Woo Jin & Taylor, Alan M., 2022.

Since the microfoundations and quantitative predictions of models with future-price collateral constraints do not appear less plausible than those using current prices, we conclude that additional empirical research on whether and how contract design is variant to policy is important for the use of these models in macroprudential policy design.","Ottonello, Pablo & Perez, Diego J. & Varraso, Paolo, 2022.

I then calibrate the model and use it to predict what would have happened to spreads and economic activity if Spain had continued to follow its pre-2010 fiscal rule instead of switching to the austerity track. I find that, relative to the counter-factual, austerity decreased sovereign spreads and debt-to-GDP ratios.

Journal of International Economics,"Reserve accumulation, growth and financial crises","['Benigno, Gianluca', 'Fornaro, Luca', 'Wolf, Martin']","We present a model that reproduces two salient facts characterizing the international monetary system: Fast growing emerging countries i) run current account surpluses, ii) accumulate international reserves and receive net private inflows. We study a two-sector, tradable and non-tradable, small open economy. There is a growth externality in the tradable sector and agents have imperfect access to international financial markets. By accumulating foreign reserves, the government induces a real exchange rate depreciation and a reallocation of production towards the tradable sector that boosts growth. Financial frictions generate imperfect substitutability between private and public debt flows so that private agents do not perfectly offset the government policy. The possibility of using reserves to provide liquidity during crises amplifies the positive impact of reserve accumulation on growth. The optimal reserve management entails a fast rate of reserve accumulation, as well as higher growth and larger current account surpluses compared to the economy with no policy intervention.","Benigno, Gianluca & Fornaro, Luca & Wolf, Martin, 2022.

A key insight is that the government can issue more debt for any level of reserves but chooses not to because doing so would increase spreads, making it more costly to borrow.

Using micro-data on the universe of French manufacturing exporters over 1995–2007, I show that a measure of export demand growth exogenous to firm-level outcomes drives down the manufacturing labor share through two effects. First, foreign demand shocks allow low-labor share, highly internationalized “superstar” exporters to grow disproportionately more. Second, foreign demand growth decreases the labor share of exporters and this effect is stronger for larger exporters. Both effects generate a sizable labor share decline, regardless of aggregate labor share dynamics. A simple heterogeneous-firm model with endogenous markups rationalizes my empirical results. Overall, these findings provide direct causal evidence of a “winner take most” phenomenon induced by trade globalization and emphasize the role of increased competition on international markets for labor share changes.","Panon, Ludovic, 2022.

The underlying reason is that firms have incentives to redeem their debt on demand to accommodate the potential liquidity needs of global investors, which makes international borrowing endogenously fragile.

First, a significant association exists between surges and shortened corporate debt maturity, especially for firms with foreign bank relationships and higher redeployability. Second, the probability of a crisis following surges with a flattened yield curve is significantly higher than that following surges without one.

Better intermediates show to be associated with a higher quality of output, making Swiss products more appealing for international markets and boosting exports. Therefore, the efficacy of Swiss global value chains improved both upstream—thanks to higher-quality intermediate inputs brought by the intensification of the existing buyer-seller relations—and downstream—because higher-quality products eased increasing exports to existing buyers and helped finding new customers, especially in distant destinations.","Ariu, Andrea, 2022.

Capital controls tax FX-debt and break the carry-trade. Differently, raising reserve requirements on domestic deposits directly reduces credit supply, particularly for riskier firms, rather than enhancing the bank-lending channel.

Moreover, in customs unions (but not necessarily in free trade areas) preferential margins should increase with the supply of partner countries and decrease with the level of preferential imports. These relationships reflect, respectively, the internalization of political-economy goals within the bloc and the desire to curb trade diversion. Using a sample that covers most PTAs formed by Latin American countries in the 1990s, we find empirical support for each of those predictions.

Using difference-in-differences and synthetic control methods, this paper examines the effects of this shift on trade flows. Exploiting variation in the timing of adoption of the new technology by different producers to identify the causal effects of 3D printing, the analysis finds that exports of hearing aids increased by roughly 80% following the introduction of the new technology. There is no evidence of a localization effect, as overall trade in hearing aids expanded by a similar amount. As a robustness check, the paper examines 35 products that are partially 3D printed and finds positive and significant effects on trade. These effects are stronger for more complex and lighter goods. The results counter widespread views that 3D printing will shorten supply chains and reduce trade.","Freund, Caroline & Mulabdic, Alen & Ruta, Michele, 2022.

Journal of International Economics,Complex Europe: Quantifying the cost of disintegration,"['Felbermayr, Gabriel', 'Gröschl, Jasmin', 'Heiland, Inga']","We propose novel estimates of the economic consequences of undoing European goods and services markets integration. Using a quantitative multi-country, multi-sector trade model, we disentangle two important layers of complexity: First, European integration is governed by various, partly overlapping arrangements — the Customs Union, the Single Market, the Common Currency, the Schengen Area, free trade agreements — and fiscal transfers, all of which affect production, trade, and income differently. Second, decades of integration have led to dense cross-border input–output (IO) networks, which endogenously adjust to trade cost shocks. Based on our preferred gravity estimates, we find disintegration to trigger statistically significant welfare losses of up to 23%. In a conservative specification, effects are about half the size. Robustly, the Single Market dominates quantitatively, but the losses from dissolving the Schengen Area are substantial, too. Compared to a model variant without IO linkages, our complex model predicts significantly larger aggregate losses.","Felbermayr, Gabriel & Gröschl, Jasmin & Heiland, Inga, 2022.

The results show that increasing trend inflation from 2 to 4 percent in the domestic country generates a consumption-equivalent welfare loss of about 0.36 percent and 0.04 percent in the domestic and foreign countries, respectively. The cooperative optimal monetary policy under commitment with positive trend inflation faces a policy trade-off in response to technology shocks. Incorporating trend inflation in an open economy has new dynamics: domestic trend inflation amplifies the spillover effects of a domestic technology shock on foreign countries; trend inflation in foreign countries reinforces these spillover effects through the effect of price dispersion.","Zhao, Hong, 2022.

As economic activity shifts toward these business models, trade-agreements are being extended to ensure free trade in platform based products, guided by the logic and practice familiar from standard models (one-sided markets). Does this prescription automatically carry over to two-sided markets? We show that a world with FANG's can look and behave very differently from the more familiar one-sided setting, it's even possible for tariffs to lower prices, raise consumption and increase global welfare; the opposite of the one-sided result. We empirically explore the conditions for such outcomes and show they arise for a set of products recently added to the WTO's ITA, raising the possibility that policy errors are creeping into international-agreements from following one-sided logic in an increasingly two-sided world.","McCalman, Phillip, 2022.

This decline reflects active portfolio diversification by central bank reserve managers, rather than changes in exchange rates and interest rates, reserve accumulation by a handful of central banks with distinctive balance sheets, or changes in coverage of surveys of reserve composition. Strikingly, the shares of the euro, yen and pound sterling have not concurrently increased. Instead, the shift out of dollars has been in two directions: a quarter into the Chinese renminbi, and three quarters into the currencies of smaller countries that have played a more limited role in reserves. The evolution of the international reserve system in the last 20 years is thus a gradual movement away from the dollar, a modest rise in the role of the renminbi, and changes in market liquidity, relative returns and reserve management enhancing the attractions of nontraditional reserve currencies.","Arslanalp, Serkan & Eichengreen, Barry & Simpson-Bell, Chima, 2022.

In this paper, I study the migration effects of one such trade shock: The quartz crisis, which devastated the globally dominant Swiss watch industry in the 1970s. Using a differences-in-differences strategy, I show that this trade shock led to a rapid loss of population in affected areas, and a long-run change in growth patterns. This contrasts with many other studies of large trade shocks, which find little migration response. I highlight three key factors that distinguish this shock from others and may explain the divergence: (1) the crisis negatively impacted a key export industry while generating no offsetting gains, (2) the affected labor markets were highly non-diversified, and (3) the affected workers were highly mobile.","Twinam, Tate, 2022.

The large number of campaigns triggered by actions of independent suppliers points at a link between (un)ethical practices and the organization of production. We construct a measure of potential cost savings of unethical production at the industry-country level and show that it indeed correlates positively with international outsourcing rather than integration. To rationalize our finding and to investigate the issue further, we introduce a cost-saving ‘unethical’ technology and consumer boycotts into a standard property-rights model of the international organization of production. In equilibrium, the supplier's (un)ethical technology choice interacts with the headquarter's novel unethical outsourcing incentive.

The collapse of the Rana Plaza building in April 2013 generated a surge of activism and media coverage specifically targeting the firms that sourced from the factories affected by the disaster. Using monthly firm-level import data from French Customs, we study any potential disruption in these firms’ imports from all origins, and specifically from Bangladesh. We use a difference-in-differences approach. French textile imports from Bangladesh rose continuously after the shock, and the overall imports of retailers sourcing from the Rana Plaza show no drop after the event. Our results do reveal a relative decline in Bangladeshi imports for those retailers named for sourcing from the collapsed factories. This effect is mirrored by a relative increase in these exposed firms’ imports from four particular countries, which are non-Asian and are geographically closer to France.","Koenig, Pamina & Poncet, Sandra, 2022.

We develop a theoretical framework for studying the interplay between international integration and identity politics, taking into account that both policies and identities are endogenous. We find that, in general, a union is more fragile when peripheral member countries have higher status than the politically dominant “Core” countries, as this leads in equilibrium to stronger national identification in the periphery and a lower willingness to compromise. Low-status countries are less likely to secede, even when between-country differences in optimal policies are large, and although equilibrium union policies impose significant economic hardship. Contrary to the anticipation of many union advocates, mutual solidarity is unlikely to emerge as a result of integration alone.","Abramson, Boaz & Shayo, Moses, 2022.

We find robust and consistent evidence for the effect of quality differentiation on the gravity equation, using aggregate trade data and Brazilian firm-level data. We apply our model and evaluate the impact of trade policies that reduce fixed export costs.

We illustrate how the difference between the OLS and IV estimates can provide information about unobserved cross-regional heterogeneity in bank-firm matches when only aggregate regional data is available.

Theories based on the above two causes generate starkly different predictions about the pattern of negotiated tariffs. We find that the WTO agreement provides more tariff flexibility in products with lower import market power. This finding is consistent with the implication of a negotiation model under asymmetric information, which predicts a tradeoff between flexibility and discipline in tariff obligations. Finally, we use the model together with data on negotiated and applied tariffs to calibrate the political weight of each import-competing industry for all WTO member countries.","Beshkar, Mostafa & Lee, Ryan, 2022.

To rationalize these patterns, we introduce farmers with heterogeneous productivity and market participation choices into a spatial economy model. We take the model to data and find that removing the geographic barriers to farmers’ participation in non-local markets can increase Colombia's agricultural value added by up to 14%.

As a result, domestic banks reduced lending, which led to large declines in output in sectors with many small (bank-dependent) firms.

We provide a detailed dive into this borrowing by showing that it happened in one particular market segment. Firms significantly increased their large bond issuances, mostly above US$500 million, which became cheaper to issue. We find a strong clustering of issuances with a face value of exactly $500 million after 2008 compared to developed markets. This suggests increased willingness from investors, especially cross-over investors, to purchase emerging market bonds included in newly created bond indexes, which require a minimum face value of $500 million. However, not all firms could issue such large bonds. Firms large enough to do so faced a trade-off. Issuing index-eligible bonds allowed them to borrow at a lower cost at the expense of accumulating cash. Because of this “size yield discount,” many companies increased their issuances of index-eligible bonds, accumulating cash holdings.","Calomiris, Charles W. & Larrain, Mauricio & Schmukler, Sergio L. & Williams, Tomas, 2022.

It relies on a data set that combines Argentinean firm-level wine exports with experts’ wine ratings as a measure of quality. Exporters price discriminate across destinations by raising markups in more distant markets, and by lowering them in high-tariff countries. However, the response of markups to changes in trade costs is heterogeneous and weaker for higher quality exports. These empirical patterns can be predicted by trade models featuring demand functions more convex than log-concave, but less than superconvex. They demonstrate that the variation in firm-level export unit values across markets is not only driven by quality differences but also by markup variation conditional on quality.","Chen, Natalie & Juvenal, Luciana, 2022.

To assess the effects of this development on the operations of Chinese firms we adopt a new textual analysis approach to listed firms’ annual reports that allows us to create measures of TPU that vary over firms and time. Linking our new TPU measures to firm-level trade war exposure shows that increases in U.S. tariffs and Chinese retaliatory tariffs elevated firm-level TPU. The effects of Chinese firm-level tariff changes on firm TPU are heterogeneous: smaller firms experienced the most pronounced increases while firms that were more diversified in terms of partner countries were more insulated. Importantly, connecting firm-level increases in TPU during the trade war with subsequent firm performance reveals notable impairment of firm operations. Our estimates indicate that Chinese firms hit by a one standard deviation increase in TPU during the trade war reduced firm-level investment, R&D expenditures, and profits by 2.3, 2.3, and 11.5 percent, respectively.","Benguria, Felipe & Choi, Jaerim & Swenson, Deborah L. & Xu, Mingzhi (Jimmy), 2022.

These amplification effects are more prominent at the “extremes,” especially for extreme risk-off periods and for regulations that target specific risks instead of generalized cyclical buffers. This paper estimates these relationships using a policy-shocks approach that corrects for reverse causality by combining high-frequency risk measures with weekly data on portfolio investment and a new measure of macroprudential regulations that captures the intensity of policy stances. Overall, the results support a growing body of evidence that macroprudential regulation can reduce the volume and volatility of bank flows but shift risks in ways that aggravate vulnerabilities in other parts of the financial system.","Chari, Anusha & Dilts-Stedman, Karlye & Forbes, Kristin, 2022.

We interpret this as consistent with the hypothesis that markets underreact initially to predictable changes in future monetary policy.

This paper derives the optimal price index by solving the Ramsey problem in a New Keynesian small open economy model with an arbitrary number of sectors. This approach improves on the existing theoretical benchmarks by (1) making an explicit distinction between the consumer price index (CPI) and the producer price index (PPI), (2) incorporating exogenous international price shocks, and (3) allowing different pricing regimes across sectors. Qualitatively, the analytical expression of the optimal price index suggests that popular indices, such as the core/headline CPI and the PPI, are suboptimal because they ignore the effect of volatile export price inflation on the trade surplus and the heterogeneity in price stickiness. Quantitatively, when a 35-sector model is applied to 40 countries, stabilizing the optimal price index yields significantly higher welfare than alternative indices.","Matsumura, Misaki, 2022.

Our key finding is that a trade-induced increase in market concentration can be an important source of the gains from trade. Foreign competition puts downward pressure on profitability which reduces the equilibrium number of firms, but increases their size. This rise in concentration increases welfare via two channels: increasing returns in production, and a scale effect on innovation. In a calibrated version of the model we show that concentration is a main driver of the gains from trade, mostly via its stimulating effect on innovation – the contribution of increasing returns is small. Moreover, lowering trade costs reduce the inefficiency produced by “reciprocal dumping”, leading to substantial gains.

U.S. loan-level data show that a 10 percent depreciation of the local currency quarter-to-quarter increases the probability that a firm becomes past due on its loans by 42 basis points for firms with foreign currency debt relative to those with local currency debt. This increase is economically significant, given a baseline probability of 20 basis points, and indicates that exchange rate risk of borrowers can translate into credit risk for banks. Firms are more likely to borrow in foreign currency if they belong to industries that generate more income abroad and if a UIP deviation makes foreign currency loans cheaper.

In a general equilibrium trade model with monopolistic competition and stochastic demand, risk-averse entrepreneurs exploit the spatial correlation of demand across countries to lower the variance of their global sales. The model implies that both the probability of entry and trade flows to a country are increasing in the “Diversification Index”, which depends on the multilateral covariance of the country's demand with all other markets. The risk diversification behavior can lead to higher welfare gains from trade than the ones predicted by trade models with risk neutrality. Using a panel of international sales of Portuguese firms, I estimate “risk-augmented” gravity regressions, which show that the Diversification Index significantly affects trade patterns at the extensive and intensive margins. In general equilibrium, the risk diversification channel increases welfare gains from trade by 17% relative to trade models with risk neutrality.","Esposito, Federico, 2022.

For instance, for firms located outside of the United States, the US dollar is often used as a vehicle currency. The cost of hedging against this risk represents an additional trade cost for exporters, which is specific to the targeted destination. In this paper, we exploit an episode of heightened tensions in the USD/EUR foreign exchange market in July 2011, which increased the cost of hedging against US dollar fluctuations for French exporters. Using disaggregated information on bank balance sheets, bank-firm relationships and individual export flows for France, we show that exporters with a higher propensity to use hedging instruments reduced more their exports to “US dollar destinations” after this shock. For the average “treated” individual export flow in our sample, the increased hedging cost is equivalent to a counterfactual rise in trade costs by about 3 percentage points.","Berthou, Antoine & Horny, Guillaume & Mésonnier, Jean-Stéphane, 2022.

At a granular level we find that UK exporters invoice in multiple currencies—even when shipping a product to the same destination—and switch currencies over time. Remarkably, we fail to detect significant changes in the relative shares of invoicing currencies in response to the Brexit shock.

First, I provide cross-country evidence that an increase in government spending is more effective in stimulating consumption and appreciating the real exchange rate in sudden stop crises than in normal times. To rationalize this, I then build a small open economy model with a collateral constraint on international borrowing. During a financial crisis, an adverse international shock reduces consumption and lowers the market value of income as collateral. The lowered income, in turn, tightens the financial constraint and sets in a debt-deflation mechanism. In this context, a fiscal expansion appreciates the real exchange rate and drives in capital flows when the financial constraint is binding, thus creating a larger multiplier on private consumption. The difference in multipliers across financial states also depends on the exchange rate environment of a country.","Liu, Siming, 2022.

Guided by this evidence, we study the welfare effects of the reallocation brought about by stricter standards in a model with monopolistically competitive, heterogeneous firms, and a general demand system. Restrictive standards have an ambiguous effect on welfare. On the one hand, they improve allocative efficiency because low-quality firms over-produce in the market allocation. This market distortion is driven entirely by the presence of variable markups and exists to varying degrees in both homothetic and non-homothetic frameworks. On the other hand, the imposition of stricter standards forces firms to pay a fixed cost that is welfare reducing.

In the event of manufacturing technology shocks, oil demand, intermediate manufactured goods demand, and global trade move in tandem. Similarly important are shocks to final manufactured goods demand that are amplified by input-output linkages and trade. In the US, foreign shocks that cause higher oil prices – including oil supply disruptions – lead to rising manufacturing relative to services, and higher core inflation and policy rates.

We find that FX- and macroprudential interventions are effective in mitigating downside risks to portfolio flows stemming from adverse global shocks, while tightening of capital controls in response appears to be counterproductive. Good institutional frameworks are not able to shield countries from the increased volatility of portfolio flows in the immediate aftermath of global shocks, but can contribute to a more rapid bounce-back of foreign flows over the medium term.

The effect on domestic sales is positive but smaller, suggesting that the impact on trade is not limited to a scale effect. We further find that the “sub-extensive” margin (number of products and sourcing countries per firm) is the main channel of adjustment. Finally, we develop a model where firms optimize over their import strategy which yields a sufficient statistics formula for the quantification of the effects of broadband on consumer welfare.

An increase in competition may then force managers to improve the productivity of the firm in order to ensure survival.

In this paper, we exploit the fact that a large literature has documented specific non-monetary preferences of family managers. Using Spanish firm-level data, we compare how family-managed and professionally-managed firms react to import competition shocks. We find that import competition leads to productivity increases in family-managed firms that are initially unproductive. Productivity improvements are driven by family management as opposed to family ownership or non-managing family members. Furthermore, we show that these managers increase efficiency by reducing material usage, which is consistent with them trying to increase their short-term cash flow in order to survive.

This is because eliminating reliance on foreign inputs increases reliance on the domestic inputs, which are also disrupted due to nationwide lockdowns. In fact, trade can insulate a country imposing a stringent lockdown from the pandemic-shock, as its foreign inputs are less disrupted than its domestic ones. Finally, unilateral lifting of the lockdowns in the largest economies can contribute as much as 2.5% to GDP growth in some of their smaller trade partners.","Bonadio, Barthélémy & Huo, Zhen & Levchenko, Andrei A. & Pandalai-Nayar, Nitya, 2021.

Using micro-level data on anti-dumping, countervailing duties, and safeguards, I develop a new measure of U.S. trade policy announcement shocks for the period 1988–2015 that is free of confounding factors. Estimates using the new measure indicate that announced, but not yet imposed, U.S. trade restrictions give rise to contractions in major trading partners’ output and investment. Counterfactual results indicate that a decline in business confidence accounts for the lion's share of these anticipation effects. A narrative analysis that quantifies the extent of newspaper coverage of U.S. trade protection shows that media attention facilitates the propagation of protectionist shocks.

We first set up a structural three-country New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model which nests DCP, producer-currency pricing and local-currency pricing. Under partial and asymmetric DCP, the output spillovers from shocks that appreciate the US dollar decline with an economy's export-import US dollar pricing share differential, i.e. the difference between the share of an economy's export and import prices that are sticky in US dollar. Underlying this prediction is variation in an economy's net exports in response to US dollar appreciation that arises because the shares of export and import prices that are sticky in US dollar are different. We then provide evidence that this prediction from partial and asymmetric DCP is consistent with the data in a sample of up to 45 advanced and emerging market economies for the time period from 1995 to 2018. We moreover document that our findings are robust to considering US demand, US monetary policy and exogenous exchange rate shocks as a trigger of US dollar appreciation, zooming in on the responses of economies’ exports and imports, as well as to accounting for the role of commodity trade in US dollar invoicing.","Georgiadis, Georgios & Schumann, Ben, 2021.

Journal of International Economics,How does trade respond to anticipated tariff changes? Evidence from NAFTA,"['Khan, Shafaat Yar', 'Khederlarian, Armen']","Firms anticipate upcoming tariff changes by shifting their purchases to periods with lower costs. This paper shows that such anticipatory dynamics overstate the trade elasticity. Standard identification of the trade response to trade cost changes uses tariff variation from Free Trade Agreements (FTA) and assumes that trade flows equal their consumption. However, FTAs eliminate tariffs gradually through announced phaseouts. This allows firms to delay their purchases until tariff cuts are effective while consuming their inventories. Indeed, during NAFTA's staged tariff reductions, imports experienced sizable anticipatory slumps followed by liberalization bumps. To study the behavior of consumed imports we construct a measure that uses inventory-sales ratios to smooth out trade flows. Its application to the data yields that the annual trade-flow elasticity is 56% larger than the trade-consumption response and that the ratio of the long- to short-run elasticity increases from 2.3 with trade flows to 3.4 with consumed imports. The measure is validated through Monte Carlo simulations of a (s_,s¯) ordering model that reproduces the observed trade pattern.","Khan, Shafaat Yar & Khederlarian, Armen, 2021.

We show that the ability of the model to replicate key empirical regularities following trade integration—synchronization of business cycles across trading partners and reallocation of market shares toward more productive firms—is central to understanding how trade costs affect monetary policy trade-offs. First, productivity gains through firm selection reduce the need for positive inflation to correct long-run distortions. As a result, lower trade costs reduce the optimal average inflation rate. Second, as stronger trade linkages increase business cycle synchronization, country-specific shocks have more global consequences. Thus, the optimal stabilization policy remains inward looking. By contrast, sub-optimal, inward-looking stabilization—for instance too narrow a focus on price stability—results in larger welfare costs when trade linkages are strong due to inefficient fluctuations in cross-country aggregate demand.","Cacciatore, Matteo & Ghironi, Fabio, 2021.

The analysis suggests that IFIs and market lenders can both enhance welfare, even if banning commercial borrowing can sometimes be optimal. To maintain their status, preferred lenders should offer low cost financing in volumes that are consistent with countries' incentives to repay even in bad states.

The results show that FDI responds to IPAs even in advanced economies. Sub-national IPAs, operating in closer proximity to investors' operations, attract FDI in particular towards less developed areas where market and institutional failures are stronger. IPAs influence FDI over and above other policies targeting the general economic improvement of the host economies. Impacts are concentrated in knowledge-intensive sectors where collaborative systemic conditions are more relevant. IPAs work best for less experienced companies - ‘occasional’ investors - more likely to suffer from institutional failures. Finally, IPAs are equally effective in attracting companies from both outside and inside the EU Single Market even if the latter are less likely to suffer from regulatory or information asymmetries. Overall, this evidence sheds new light on the role of sub-national IPAs as local ‘institutional plumbers’ in support of foreign investors and their operations.","Crescenzi, Riccardo & Di Cataldo, Marco & Giua, Mara, 2021.

We present a robust but previously undocumented relationship between corporate leverage and country-level foreign exchange reserve holdings. For 6610 non-financial firms in 23 emerging markets from 2000 to 2006, we show that more foreign reserve accumulation leads to higher corporate leverage.

Using data for 20 economies (half of which are advanced and emerging market economies, respectively), this paper tests whether the various target types anchor inflation expectations differently. By studying to what extent inflation expectations are responsive to past inflation and how much forecasters disagree, it tests two contradictory hypotheses, namely that targets with intervals lead to (i) less anchoring, e.g. because they provide more flexibility to the central bank, or (ii) better anchoring, because they are missed less often, leading to an enhanced credibility. The evidence refutes the first hypothesis, and generally finds that target ranges or (in some cases) tolerance bands outperform the other types. However, the effects partially depend on the economic context and no target type consistently outperforms all others. This suggests that there are some benefits to adopting intervals, but the central bank can anchor inflation expectations also by other means.","Ehrmann, Michael, 2021.

Greater transparency enables the firm to commit to less data usage, which boosts consumer demand and leads to a higher price but also higher output if the firm operates only in one country. A multinational firm faces more challenges when balancing the trade-offs in data usage across countries that differ in consumer preferences for privacy. Contrary to the result for a single country, more transparency can exacerbate data-usage and output distortions in the global economy, and unilateral data regulation by a country may reduce global welfare.

Using two dynamic trade models, we decompose fluctuations in the trade balance into terms related to trade integration (global and unilateral) and business cycle asymmetries. We find three main results. First, the relatively large US trade deficits as a share of GDP in the 2000s compared to the 1980s mostly reflect a rise in the trade share of GDP. Second, controlling for trade, only about 60% of net trade flows are due to business cycle asymmetries. And third, about two-thirds of the contribution of business-cycle asymmetries are a lagged response. For instance, the short-run Armington elasticity is about 0.2 while the long-run is closer to 1.12 with only 6.9% of the gap closed per quarter. We show that a two-country IRBC model with a dynamic exporting decision, pricing-to-market, and trade cost shocks can account for the dynamics of the US trade balance, real exchange rate, and trade integration. The model clarifies how permanent and transitory changes in trade barriers affect the trade balance and how to identify changes in trade barriers.

Yet measuring the prospective cost of a global tariff war remains computationally prohibitive, unless we restrict attention to a small set of countries and industries. This paper develops a new methodology that measures the cost of a global tariff war in one simple step as a function of observable shares, industry-level trade elasticities, and markup wedges. Applying this methodology to data on 44 countries and 56 industries, I find that (i) the prospective cost of a global tariff war has more-than-doubled over the past fifteen years, with small downstream economies being the most vulnerable. (ii) Meanwhile, due to the rise of global markup distortions, the potential gains from cooperative tariff policies have also elevated to unprecedented levels.","Lashkaripour, Ahmad, 2021.

This theory is guided by new findings drawn from a matched exporter-importer dataset that characterizes the relationships between exporting and importing firms. I find that most exporters have a single importing partner, that highly productive exporters tend to trade with highly productive importers, and that the value traded is positively correlated with both exporter and importer productivities. The model analyzes the selection of exporters and importers into trading pairs and features simultaneous free entry into exporting and into importing. This theory provides a rationale for the fixed costs of entering export markets, associating them with the costs of searching for importing firms that distribute a product to final consumers abroad. I test this theory by studying the response of exporting and importing firms to the recent Colombia-U.S. free trade agreement.

We address this question by studying two-sided market competition between a foreign and a domestic content distribution platform in a small open economy. On the one hand, bilingualism has the benefit of increasing cross-side network externalities by increasing consumer concentration on the foreign platform, which increases the amount of home language content. On the other hand, bilingualism exposes home language content to competition from foreign language content and softens platform competition, which reduces the amount of home language content.

We then use contemporaneous economic records to classify such changes as endogenous or exogenous to current (or prospective) economic conditions. In line with theoretical distortionary and disincentive-based arguments – and using exogenous tax changes – we find that the effect of tax changes on output is highly non-linear. The tax multiplier is essentially zero under relatively low initial tax rate levels and more negative as the initial tax rate increases. Based on a global sample, these novel non-linear findings suggest that the recent consensus pointing to large negative tax multipliers in industrial countries, particularly in industrial Europe (e.g., Alesina, Favero, and Giavazzi, 2015) may represent a special case driven by high initial tax rates in these countries.","Gunter, Samara & Riera-Crichton, Daniel & Vegh, Carlos A. & Vuletin, Guillermo, 2021.

A central feature of processing regimes is that firms do not have to pay tariffs on imported inputs as long as they are used exclusively in the production of goods for export. These firms are typically restricted from selling output using imported inputs on the domestic market. These restrictions can be viewed as a form of incomplete liberalization due to protectionist motives. Using data from China for 2000–2007 for 109 industries, we study the welfare effects of these measures. Counterfactual experiments imply total welfare losses of 2.2% for China due to the restriction on selling processing output domestically, and even larger loses of 5.7% for labor.

The gains from reducing tariffs arise from substituting away from firm creation and towards exporting. This substitution is larger when new exporters are smaller and take longer to grow into successful exporters. The welfare gains from reducing tariffs are much larger than the long-run changes in consumption and the welfare gains cannot be recovered from a static model or from formulas based on those models.

The effect of commodity price volatility on banking crises is concentrated in LICs with a fixed exchange rate regime and a high share of primary goods in production.

The optimal policy under this trade-off results in macroeconomic patterns aligned with those observed in emerging-markets data, including large currency depreciation and consumption adjustments during crises.

Journal of International Economics,Global corporate debt during crises: Implications of switching borrowing across markets,"['Cortina, Juan J.', 'Didier, Tatiana', 'Schmukler, Sergio L.']","This paper shows how crises prompted firms to switch borrowing across debt markets, impacting the amount borrowed, maturity, and currency denomination at the firm and aggregate levels. During financial crises, firms from advanced and emerging economies shifted their issuance activity between domestic and international syndicated loans and corporate bonds. Firms increased their borrowing in markets not directly hit by crises, partly compensating for declines in shock-hit markets, which provides evidence of market-specific credit supply shocks. As firms moved away from the markets in crisis and borrowed elsewhere, they maintained their borrowing maturity and changed their currency denomination. Changes occurred not only within firms, but also in the composition of issuing firms. The number of borrowing firms declined in crisis-hit markets and increased elsewhere. Mostly large firms issued during crises and switched markets. Overall, the debt dynamics obtained from studying jointly different debt markets differ from those observed in individual markets.","Cortina, Juan J. & Didier, Tatiana & Schmukler, Sergio L., 2021.

We use transaction-level export data for the universe of exporters in Portugal. Using monthly observations on export quantity and price for products exported by the same firm to buyers in the UK and in other countries allows us to cleanly identify the differential response to the shock in the UK market. We find that exporters reduce the export volume and export price in the UK market after the referendum shock. We document heterogeneous responses to the shock across exporters. More productive, import-intensive and financially unconstrained exporters react to the shock by decreasing significantly more their export prices to the UK so that their export volumes decrease by less. We also find that goods with higher elasticity of substitution experienced a lower reduction in export price and a higher reduction in export volume. The effects of the shock are significantly larger for durable goods than for non-durable goods. The referendum shock also contributed to deter export entry to the UK market and reduce the probability of continuing to export in the UK.","Fernandes, Ana P. & Winters, L. Alan, 2021.

This is an issue since international transfers to sustain the global optimum with the same carbon price for all countries are still lacking after thirty years of climate summits. The main research objective of our paper is to obtain tractable analytical and interpretable formulas for the SCC, the optimal carbon taxes, and the optimal consumption-abatement strategies in a non-cooperative world. We find that the optimal taxes are proportional to national GDP and can be decomposed into a domestic and a foreign component where the latter stems from trade. Besides, heterogeneity in country-specific damage functions together with the size of international trade significantly affects the regional distribution of the SCC. Consequently, trade can also affect the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere.","Hambel, Christoph & Kraft, Holger & Schwartz, Eduardo, 2021.

Ownership relations between, for example, headquarters and subsidiaries result in international income transfers. These transfers are ignored in standard trade data.

This provides a new perspective compared to the concept of value-added exports introduced by Johnson and Noguera (2012). For the US, we find that the income generated by foreign consumption is 51% higher than the value added in the US that is generated by foreign consumption.

It turns out that many informational assumptions make a standard two-country New Keynesian model match this behavior. To identify the particular mechanism, we condition on multiple asset prices in the event study and model implications for these. We find that there is heterogeneity in this dimension in the event study and no model with a single regime can match the evidence. Further, even after conditioning on possible information effects driving longer term interest rates, there appear to be other drivers of exchange rates.

Changes in a number of risk- and policy-related factors have a significant association with the evolution of CIP deviations. Key measures of FX market liquidity and intermediaries' risk-taking capacity are strongly correlated with the cross-currency basis (the deviation from CIP), and the close relationship between broad U.S. dollar strength and the basis is driven mainly by a common factor depending on other safe-haven currencies' comovements. Post-crisis monetary policies also play a role, as demonstrated by the relationship between CIP deviations, central bank balance sheets, and term premia. Risk-related factors have more explanatory power than monetary policy-related factors over the entire 2010–2018 period, but they are approximately equally influential over the period's second half. Further highlighting the role of bank regulation, we offer evidence that the year-end dynamics of the three-month dollar basis depend on financial regulations targeting global systemically important financial institutions.","Cerutti, Eugenio M. & Obstfeld, Maurice & Zhou, Haonan, 2021.

To explain this paradox we develop a political agency model where gains from migration are unevenly distributed, and an elected government chooses both quotas and their enforcement. We show that distributional concerns can have perverse effects on migration policy since a utilitarian government may set a quota to appease the electorate, but then strategically under-invest in its enforcement. Under-investment is more likely, the larger the preference gap between median and average voter, and the higher the likelihood of a populist challenger gaining office. Our analysis also indicates that redistributive taxation reducing the share of enforcement cost borne by the median voter exacerbates the problem, whereas a compensatory tax rebate financed through a tax on profits from migration alleviates the conflict of interest, thus reducing illegal immigration.","Facchini, Giovanni & Testa, Cecilia, 2021.

We find that respondents' high support for trade is based primarily on perceived employment gains. General support for trade is unaffected by consumption benefits framing, but is highly sensitive downward to employment loss framing. Positive framing does shift upward respondent beliefs that trade reduces consumption prices, but also raises concerns about low wages. Negative framing substantially weakens the prevailing beliefs that trade brings higher employment.

Journal of International Economics,Measuring trade in value added with firm-level data,"['Bems, Rudolfs', 'Kikkawa, Ayumu Ken']",Global Value Chains have proliferated in economic policy debates. Yet a key concept—trade in value added—is likely mismeasured because of sectoral aggregation bias stemming from reliance on input-output tables. This paper uses comprehensive firm-level data on domestic and international transactions to study this bias. We find that sectoral aggregation leads to overstated trade in value added. The magnitude of the bias varies across countries—at 2–5 p.p. of gross exports for Belgium and 17 p.p. for China. We study how the interplay between within-sector heterogeneities in firms' import and export intensities and size determine the magnitude of the bias.,"Bems, Rudolfs & Kikkawa, Ayumu Ken, 2021.

We introduce novel state-contingent ambiguity attitudes, which endogenously induce pessimism in recessions and optimism in booms, in a model with occasionally binding collateral constraints and exogenous debt supply. Ambiguity is measured in the data through GMM estimation of the Euler equations, and delivers over-extrapolative behaviors through forecasters' beliefs' wedges and forecast errors. Analytically and numerically (global methods), it is shown that the model explains asset price and debt cycle facts. Optimism heightens the build-up of debt and asset prices prior to a crisis event and enhances leverage pro-cyclicality; pessimism heightens the de-leveraging following it.","Bassanin, Marzio & Faia, Ester & Patella, Valeria, 2021.

We employ the proxy-instrumental variable approach to identify structural vector autoregressions in a panel setting and empirically study the transmission of US technology innovations to the G7 countries. Both unanticipated and anticipated exogenous technology improvements lead to a strong and persistent real appreciation (from the point of view of the US), along with an expansionary effect on US macroeconomic aggregates, except for hours worked which initially decline. Internationally, there is a strong and precisely estimated positive spillover on foreign output, consumption, and hours worked in the case of surprise shocks, and a weaker but still mostly non-negative effect in the case of technology news shocks.

First, using high-frequency trade policy data, we present fresh evidence on the dynamic effects of temporary trade barriers. Estimates from country-level and panel VARs show that protectionism acts as a supply shock, causing output to fall and inflation to rise in the short run. Moreover, protectionism has at best a small positive effect on the trade balance. Second, we build a small open economy model with firm heterogeneity, endogenous selection into trade, and nominal rigidity that successfully reproduces the VAR evidence. The model highlights the importance of aggregate investment dynamics and micro-level reallocations for the contractionary effects of tariffs. We then use the model to study scenarios where temporary trade barriers have been advocated as potentially beneficial, including recessions with binding constraints on monetary policy easing or in the presence of a fixed exchange rate.

We uncover several new channels through which PTAs affect global welfare. Some effects stem from intensive margin changes—i.e., changes in investment and production in existing vertical chains—and from extensive margin relocations—i.e., due to the formation and destruction of vertical chains. In each case, there are potential trade-creating, trade-diverting and relationship-strengthening forces. The first two are reminiscent of the classical Vinerian approach, but take different forms under global sourcing. The third is entirely new in the regionalism literature and arises because PTAs affect the severity of hold-up problems in sourcing relationships. We characterize those forces and show circumstances when PTAs are necessarily welfare-enhancing or welfare-decreasing.

Journal of International Economics,The impact of trade liberalization on productivity distribution under the presence of technology diffusion and innovation,"['Kishi, Keiichi', 'Okada, Keisuke']","We develop an international trade model in which firms' productivity is affected by technology diffusion and innovation, and the model generates an endogenous Pareto productivity distribution. Each new entrant to the market randomly searches for and meets incumbents and then adopts their existing technology, which is considered technology diffusion. The incumbents adopt the newly developed frontier technology, which is considered innovation. The endogenous response of the productivity distribution to trade liberalization differs depending on whether the incumbents possess a high or low frequency of innovation. In an economy with a low frequency of innovation, trade liberalization increases both the Pareto exponent and the exit-cutoff productivity level. This higher Pareto exponent shifts the weight of the productivity distribution from the upper-tail area to the area around the new lower productivity bound, which generates productivity losses. The dominant productivity gains through the increasing of exit-cutoff productivity increase average productivity across all firms. However, in an economy with a high frequency of innovation, trade liberalization increases moderately or decreases both the Pareto exponent and the exit-cutoff productivity level. The reduced Pareto exponent generates productivity gains by accumulating highly productive incumbents. In total, however, trade liberalization generates weaker productivity gains or productivity losses on average productivity across all firms due to the moderately increased or reduced exit-cutoff productivity. Consequently, the welfare gains from trade are smaller in economies with high frequency of innovation than in those with low frequency.","Kishi, Keiichi & Okada, Keisuke, 2021.

We jointly analyze global drivers of gross outflows, gross inflows, and net flows (outflows minus inflows) by estimating a latent factor model. We find evidence of two global factors, which we call the global financial cycle (GFC) factor and an energy price factor as they closely track respectively the Miranda-Agrippino and Rey asset price factor and an average of oil and gas prices. These factors together account for half the variance of gross flows in advanced countries and 40% of the variance of gross flows in emerging markets. But remarkably, they also account for 40% of the variance of net capital flows in both groups of countries. We analyze the heterogeneity across countries in the impact of the two factors. The impact of the GFC factor on both gross and net capital flows is stronger in countries that have larger net debt liabilities. Other asset classes (FDI and portfolio equity) are not associated with increased exposure to the GFC factor.","Davis, J. Scott & Valente, Giorgio & van Wincoop, Eric, 2021.

Journal of International Economics,Openness and factor shares: Is globalization always bad for labor?,"['Leblebicioğlu, Asli', 'Weinberger, Ariel']","This paper studies the response of factor shares to the liberalization episode in India during the 1990's, which is characterized by large and unexpected changes in trade and foreign investment policies. We find that access to foreign capital caused an increase in the labor-to-capital relative factor share. As lower tariffs on capital goods and FDI liberalization reduce the cost of foreign capital, firms increase their use of foreign capital relative to domestic capital. This shift in the composition of the capital stock improves capital's productivity per unit of expenditure, which in turn raises wages and the relative labor share. Consistent with this mechanism, firm TFP and the share of firms that import capital both increase in industries with the largest capital cost reductions, while the relatively larger rise of labor payments is observed predominantly for new capital importers. We identify domestic deregulation policies and reallocation to capital-intensive firms as potential determinants of the observed decline in the aggregate labor share. Finally, in a model where domestic and foreign capital are imperfect substitutes, we quantify the effect of a reduction in capital tariffs, and find that it explains a large part of the estimated increase in the labor share found in the reduced form analysis.","Leblebicioğlu, Asli & Weinberger, Ariel, 2021.

We start by identifying female-oriented and male-oriented skills at the occupation level based on literature in neuroscience and medicine. Then with industries' occupational employment share data and exports data, we are able to construct country-level gender-specific skill export intensities. They are combined with gender norm information from World Value Surveys to test the hypothesis. To establish causality, a gravity model based IV strategy is adopted to get export intensities from trade flows predicted with exogenous factors. The empirical results show that if a country exports more in industries using female-oriented skills intensively relative to male-oriented skills, individuals in that country are more likely to have equal gender norms. Mechanism tests indicate that this relationship holds because expansion in female-oriented exporting sectors improves females' probability to work and their economic contribution to the household. In addition, we find suggestive evidence that some females choose to postpone their marriage age and have fewer children to seize increased job opportunities. Besides improved economic status, females also put more emphasis on work following export expansions in female-oriented skill sectors, which also contributes to equal gender norms.","Li, Jie, 2021.

Poor migrant households reduced domestic and increased international labor migration in response to the shock. Rich migrant households remained largely unaffected. I provide a theoretical framework, which rationalizes this heterogeneity by the relative magnitudes of income and substitution effects caused by the shock. The results imply a deterioration in the skill selection of aggregate international migrant flows as poor households had below average skill levels. New international migrants targeted the same destinations as established ones from the same household, providing evidence of strong kinship migration networks. Changes in migration also led to an increase in intimate partner cohabitation and fertility among poor families.

We test the model predictions using detailed firm- and product-level data from Chinese industrial surveys and customs records. Our empirical analyses rely on China's Golden Tax Project, which is an information technology introduced in 2001–2002 that dramatically reduces the cost of VAT enforcement. We find that, after the adoption of the technology by the government, firms located far from local tax offices face a larger increase in their effective VAT rates than those located nearby (the enforcement effect), and the former increase their export more than the latter (the elusion effect).

Within monetary unions, these effects are found to be very minor though, at least when online prices are considered. However, analyzing household scanner price data from three euro area member states, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, we document that households face (and pay) significantly different prices for identical goods across these countries in the vast majority (around 75%) of cases considered. For regions within countries, as a counterfactual, however, no evidence for such effects exists. Employing cross-border shopping information, we are able to draw direct conclusions about the question of integration of markets for a substantial number of goods. In addition, we can also derive a measure of border costs for most of them. For goods, for which no cross-border shopping take place, we provide a lower bound for border costs in the majority of cases. In line with existing evidence, our findings suggest considerable heterogeneities in border costs. Median values generally range between 15% and 20% (of the price of a good) for exact border cost estimates and between 18% and 20% for the derived lower bounds. Considering the distribution of values obtained suggests that most values lie in a range of ±40%. Since our data set comprises purchase information from all major retailers present in a given market, we are also able to examine the role of retailer heterogeneity for cross-border price gap estimates. Differences in retailer composition turn out to be fairly small, however. Grouping goods by various characteristics reveals that goods purchased more often tend to exhibit somewhat bigger border estimates.

Thus, the Jones Act requirements have become more onerous over time. The results show that domestic shipments are less likely to be transported via water than imports of the same good into the same state. Exploiting the decline in Jones-Act-eligible vessels over time, additional results show that this cabotage law has disproportionately decreased domestic water trade especially in coastal states.

The welfare of its trading partner, however, falls in each of these three cases. The market may provide too little or too much entry, depending on a simple relationship among model parameters. Correspondingly, global free trade is generally not efficient, even within the class of symmetric trade policies. We also provide conditions under which, starting at the symmetric Nash equilibrium, countries can mutually gain by exchanging small reductions in import tariffs, export tariffs or combinations thereof. More generally, we show that Nash equilibria are inefficient while “politically optimal” policies are efficient, indicating a central role for the terms-of-trade externality.

As a result of this trade off, high-wage economies specialize in heavier varieties of a given good, while geographically distant economies specialize in lighter varieties (i.e., weight-based quality specialization). Micro-level trade data support these predictions and suggest that weight-based quality specialization can explain a significant portion of the cross-national variation in export prices and export quality. Moreover, accounting for the heterogeneity in export unit weights yields support for the iceberg trade cost assumption, which has proven to be elusive in the past.","Lashkaripour, Ahmad, 2020.

Journal of International Economics,Beliefs and long-maturity sovereign debt,"['Stangebye, Zachary R.']","A novel form of strategic complementarities is explored in a standard quantitative model of long-maturity sovereign debt. Discrepancies in long-run beliefs dilute current prices differently. Negative long-run beliefs become self-fulfilling if the sovereign optimally borrows more and defaults more frequently in the face of worse prices. A strong curvature in the flow utility is an important ingredient in generating this response. The intuition bears out both through a multiplicity of Markov equilibria and in sunspot equilibria that mimic trigger strategies in repeated games. In the benchmark model, average spreads are roughly 67% higher (200 basis points) and debt-to-GDP ratios are roughly 9% higher (5 percentage points) when beliefs are pessimistic. The model also reveals limitations to third-party coordination of expectations as a policy tool.","Stangebye, Zachary R., 2020.

Using robots instead of humans for production may lower the relative cost of domestic production and, in turn, reduce demand for imports from offshoring countries. I analyze the impact of robots on employment in an offshoring country, using data from Mexican local labor markets between 1990 and 2015. Recent literature estimates the effect of robots on local employment by regressing the change in employment on exposure to domestic robots in local labor markets. I construct a similar measure of exposure to foreign robots, based on the initial geographic distribution of export-producing employment across industries, industry-level robot adoption in the US, and a US industry's initial reliance on Mexican imports. To purge results from endogeneity, I use robot adoption in the rest of the world and an index of offshoring as instruments for robot adoption in the US and the share of Mexican imports, respectively. Using these instruments, I show that US robots have a sizeable negative impact on employment in Mexico. This negative effect is stronger for men than for women, and strongest for low-educated machine operators in the manufacturing sector. Consistently with reshoring as a mechanism, I find that the employment effect is mirrored in similarly large reductions in Mexican exports and export-producing plants.","Faber, Marius, 2020.

We use the model to study if portfolio shifts away from purely real and external debt contributed to emerging market disinflation in the mid 1990s.

In the empirical part of the paper we show that whereas these two variables, per-se, are not significant determinants of observed debt levels across countries, their interaction is a key factor to explain debt-levels heterogeneity. Specifically, political conflicts imply higher borrowing only in non-transparent economies. In the theoretical model we propose a rationale for this effect. When the incumbent has preferences over distribution of resources across different groups, in a transparent economy political uncertainty leads to precautionary savings. Nevertheless, assuming that in more non-transparent economies the probability of an incumbent to be re-elected is more strongly a function of current economic conditions, then political uncertainty leads to borrowing incentives. We structurally estimate the two frictions in our model (political conflict and lack of transparency) by using their macroeconomic implications. Then, we compare the estimated frictions with the proxies for political conflict and lack of transparency in the data and we find a significant relationship, which supports our theory.","Pancrazi, Roberto & Prosperi, Lorenzo, 2020.

Low and stable interest rates reinforce overborrowing arising from a pecuniary externality generated by collateral constraints that depend on asset prices. We show that this mechanism leads to greater exposure to crises typically accompanied by abrupt increases in interest rates and a persistent rise in their volatility, as observed during sudden stops in EMEs. A tax on international borrowing that implements a social planner's optimal policy can be decomposed into three factors: the severity of future crises, the ability of the planner to dampen future crises, and the incidence of future crises. We show that the effects of interest rate volatility on these factors implies that, qualitatively, the tax responds non-monotonically with respect to the direction of volatility shocks and that, quantitatively, increasing macroprudential taxes is seldom the optimal response to an increase in interest rate volatility.","Reyes-Heroles, Ricardo & Tenorio, Gabriel, 2020.

The model is calibrated to the Mexican economy, in particular to business cycle moments for employment and informality. We show that interest rate shocks, which affect specifically job creation in the formal sector, are key to obtain a countercyclical informality rate. In our model, the presence of an informal sector might help to mitigate the impact of a stringent labor regulation on employment and consumption fluctuations. In that sense, it adds flexibility to the economy in its adjustment to shocks, but at the cost of a lower productivity and an excess TFP and output volatility. Reducing the burden of labor regulation to the formal sector might achieve the goal of reducing output volatility while improving at the same time the efficiency in the allocation of resources.","Leyva, Gustavo & Urrutia, Carlos, 2020.

Guided by these facts, we build a model based on the standard proximity-concentration trade-off extended to incorporate time-varying firm productivity and sunk costs of MNE entry. The calibrated version of the model goes far in matching cross-sectional and dynamic moments of the data on exporters and MNEs.

We exploit firm-level panel data on product and process innovation activities in the United Kingdom and find that the large, unanticipated, low-skill labor supply (immigration) shock generated by the 2004 expansion of the European Union to Eastern European countries increased process innovation and reduced product innovation, with overall innovation activity going up. This implies that the innovation response to labor supply shocks may be more nuanced than the previous literature has suggested. Both of these effects are increasing in the low-skill intensity of firm production. In addition, the reduction in product innovation is lessened for firms whose output is sold locally, which is consistent with a demand side effect generated by the labor supply shock.","Gray, Rowena & Montresor, Giulia & Wright, Greg C., 2020.

Journal of International Economics,Can global uncertainty promote international trade?,"['Baley, Isaac', 'Veldkamp, Laura', 'Waugh, Michael']","Common wisdom holds that uncertainty impedes trade—yet we show that uncertainty can fuel more trade in a simple general equilibrium trade model with information frictions. In equilibrium, increases in uncertainty increase both the mean and variance in returns to exporting. This implies that trade can increase or decrease with uncertainty, depending on preferences. Under general conditions on preferences, we characterize the importance of these forces using a sufficient statistics approach. Higher uncertainty leads to increases in trade because agents receive improved terms of trade, particularly in states of nature in which consumption is most valuable. Trade creates value, in part, by offering a mechanism for risk sharing, and risk sharing is most effective when both parties are uninformed.","Baley, Isaac & Veldkamp, Laura & Waugh, Michael, 2020.

Journal of International Economics,"International trade, product lines and welfare: The roles of firm and consumer heterogeneity","['McCalman, Phillip']","A central prediction of international trade models is that increased integration leads to specialization. This mechanism has been used to gain insight into the location of industries across countries, the reallocation of output across firms as well as the variation of a firm's product range as countries liberalize. Nevertheless, the notion that international trade will lead firms to rationalize their product portfolios and concentrate on their “best” products doesn't always square with reality. In particular, firms in prominent industries have, on occasion, extended their offerings to include a lower quality version/option as international competition increases – expanding rather than contracting their product portfolio. This paper demonstrates that such behavior can be generated in a standard trade model if there is consumer heterogeneity within a country and firms leverage these differences to their advantage. In this setting, increased competition can be associated with either product line reductions or extensions. That is, both types of behavior can arise in equilibrium from ostensibly similar shocks. Since trade costs directly influence the intensity of competition, their variation has important implications for product line design and also the distribution of welfare gains. In particular, product line extensions due to trade liberalization have especially large welfare benefits for low income consumers.","McCalman, Phillip, 2020.

However, unlike during sudden stop episodes, long-term debt does not shield the country from bad news shocks, and it may even exacerbate default risk.

As a consequence, a country reducing its import tariffs may experience an increase in exports as well as imports. Using worldwide data covering 1995–2007, we find evidence that supports these predictions: a 1% reduction in an importer's tariffs increases the import freight rates by around 0.8%; decreases the export freight rates by around 1.1%; and increases the export quantity by 0.6% to 1%.

Specifically, simultaneous feedback effects between interest rates and exchange rates, which are inherently forward-looking variables, are often excluded or modeled alongside with strong restrictions. In this paper, I identify U.S. monetary policy shocks using surprises in Federal funds futures around policy announcements as external instruments, which recent literature has established to represent the appropriate laboratory in settings encompassing macroeconomic and financial variables.

Journal of International Economics,"Trade, pollution and mortality in China","['Bombardini, Matilde', 'Li, Bingjing']","Did the rapid expansion of Chinese exports between 1990 and 2010 contribute to the country's worsening environmental quality? We exploit variation in local industrial composition to gauge the effect on pollution and health outcomes of export expansion due to the decline in tariffs faced by Chinese exporters. In theory, rising exports can increase pollution and mortality due to increased output, but they may also raise local incomes, which can in turn promote better health and environmental quality. The paper teases out these competing effects by constructing two export shocks at the prefecture level: (i) the pollution content of export expansion and (ii) the export expansion in dollars per worker. We find that the pollution content of exports affects pollution and mortality: a one standard deviation increase in the shock increases infant mortality by 4.1 deaths per thousand live births, which is about 23% of the standard deviation of infant mortality change during the period. The dollar value of export expansion reduces mortality by 1.2 deaths, but the effect is not statistically significant. We show that the channel through which exports affect mortality is pollution concentration. We find a negative, but insignificant effect on pollution of the dollar-value export shocks, a potential “technique” effect whereby higher income drives demand for clean environment. Finally, we find that only infant mortality related to cardio-respiratory conditions responds to exports shocks, while deaths due to accidents and other causes are not affected.","Bombardini, Matilde & Li, Bingjing, 2020.

This finding is confirmed in an extended model where we allow a set of policy variables (financial development, human capital, competition policy, and knowledge stock) to affect absorptive capacity, none of which induce permanent growth effects. The proxies for financial development and knowledge stock stand out for their significant level effects.","De Visscher, Stef & Eberhardt, Markus & Everaert, Gerdie, 2020.

Journal of International Economics,Sovereign default resolution through maturity extension,"['Mihalache, Gabriel']","Sovereign default episodes are resolved by restructuring the debt through renegotiations and implemented by bond swaps and resumption of debt service payments. This process provides debt relief for the sovereign and partially compensates lenders for their losses. In the data, the bulk of such debt relief is implemented by extending the maturity of the debt rather than changing its face value. We augment a standard maturity choice model with a post-default renegotiation phase and study whether it can replicate this observed maturity extension. The model is successful in generating this and other key features of renegotiations and maturity choice, but critically only when we assume that sovereigns continue to be excluded temporarily from financial markets after renegotiation, consistent with the observation that countries do not immediately resume borrowing. In contrast, a version of the model where market access is restored promptly features a counterfactual reduction in maturity, a puzzle for the standard model.","Mihalache, Gabriel, 2020.

Two additional limitations prevent policy-makers from being able to actively manage inflation expectations. First, available surveys of firms' expectations are systematically deficient, which can only be addressed through the creation of large, nationally representative surveys of firms. Second, neither households' nor firms' expectations respond much to monetary policy announcements in low-inflation environments.

Within the family of simple monetary policy rules with commitment, a rule that targets separate producer price inflation at different production stages, in addition to output gap and real exchange rate, is found to deliver a higher welfare level than alternative policy rules. As an economy becomes more open, measured by export share, the optimal weight on the upstream inflation rises relative to that on the final stage inflation. If we have to choose among aggregate price indicators, targeting PPI inflation yields a smaller welfare loss than targeting CPI inflation alone. As the production chain becomes longer, the optimal weight on PPI inflation in the policy rule that targets both PPI and CPI inflation will also rise. A trade cost shock such as a rise in the import tariff can alter the optimal weights on different inflation variables.","Wei, Shang-Jin & Xie, Yinxi, 2020.

Price discrimination (i) is substantial within the EU, within the euro area, and within EMU countries; (ii) has not decreased over the last two decades; (iii) is more prevalent among the largest firms and for more differentiated products; (iv) is lower among retailers and wholesalers; (v) is also observed within almost perfectly homogenous product categories, which suggests that a non-negligible share of price discrimination is partly triggered by heterogeneous markups rather than quality or composition effects.

Households' portfolio composition and the extent of foreign currency borrowing are key determinants of the magnitude of the contraction in consumption associated with a sudden stop in capital inflows. The contraction is more severe when households are leveraged and owe debt in foreign currency. In this setting, the revaluation of foreign debt causes a larger contraction in aggregate consumption when debt and leverage are concentrated among poorer households. Closing the output gap via an exchange-rate devaluation may therefore be detrimental to household welfare due to the heterogeneous impact of the foreign debt revaluation. Our HANKSOME framework can rationalize the observed “fear of floating” in emerging market economies, even in the absence of contractionary devaluations.","de Ferra, Sergio & Mitman, Kurt & Romei, Federica, 2020.

To rationalize these findings, we propose a model of oligopolistic competition in which, by supplying services with their goods, firms increase their market share, and hence their market power and markup.

However, this intuition has so far not been formalized. I develop a general equilibrium setup in which the sensitivity of inflation to marginal cost decreases in response to a fall in trade costs. In order to do so, I add three ingredients to an otherwise standard two-country new-Keynesian model: strategic interactions, endogenous entry of exporters and heterogeneous productivity. Because of differences in firms productivity, only high-productivity firms (that are also the larger ones) start exporting when international trade cost falls. These firms transmit less marginal cost fluctuations to their prices, rather strategically absorbing them into their desired markup. At the aggregate level, the increase in the proportion of large firms makes inflation respond less to real activity fluctuations. A simple calibration of the model shows that globalization could explain around one fifth to one third of the flattening of the Phillips curve in the United States from the early 1980s to mid-2000s.","Guilloux-Nefussi, Sophie, 2020.

I quantify the model using both firm-level and aggregate moments for 37 countries. I found that the reduction in MP costs accounts for 56% of the average decline in labor shares from 1996 to 2011, and the model also replicates a negative relationship between the change in a country's labor share and the change in the foreign affiliates' output share as observed in the data.","Sun, Chang, 2020.

Our analysis features a terms-of-trade channel that makes security policies trade-regime dependent.

Although a move to trade can otherwise induce greater arming by one country and thus need not be welfare improving for both, aggregate arming falls. By contrast, when the two adversaries do not trade with each other but instead trade with a third (friendly) country, a move from autarky to trade intensifies conflict between the two adversaries, inducing greater arming. With data from the years surrounding the end of the Cold War, we exploit the contrasting implications of trade costs between enemies versus trade costs between friends to provide some suggestive evidence in support of the theory.","Garfinkel, Michelle R. & Syropoulos, Constantinos & Yotov, Yoto V., 2020.

Journal of International Economics,"Financial stability, growth and macroprudential policy","['Ma, Chang']","This paper studies the effect of optimal macroprudential policy in a small open economy model where growth is endogenous. By introducing endogenous growth, this model is able to capture the persistent effect of financial crises on output, which is different from previous literature but consistent with the data. Furthermore, there is a new policy trade-off between cyclical and trend consumption growth. In a calibrated version of the baseline model, I find that the impact of the optimal macroprudential policy on growth and welfare is quantitatively small even if it significantly increases financial stability. I consider two extensions of the model in which the optimal macroprudential policy has a larger impact on growth and welfare: one in which macroprudential policy is jointly used with a growth subsidy that helps reduce the cost of financial crises; and another extension with a direct growth externality.","Ma, Chang, 2020.

We apply our model to 7 developed economies and 21 emerging market economies. Our results suggest that while global factors can have a sizeable influence on the inflation gap, they play only a marginal role in driving trend inflation. Much of the influence of global factors in the inflation gap may be reflecting commodity price shocks. Finally, we find the effect of global factors to be greater in our sample of emerging market economies relative to the developed economies.

Journal of International Economics,Estimating bargaining-related tax advantages of multinational firms,"['Egger, Peter H.', 'Strecker, Nora M.', 'Zoller-Rydzek, Benedikt']","The effective corporate profit tax rates (ETRs) of multinational enterprises (MNEs) are in general lower than those of national enterprises (NEs). In this paper, we argue that the bargaining power of MNEs is an important factor in explaining these differences beyond profit shifting. First, larger and more profitable firms are more valuable for tax authorities through, e.g., higher tax revenues and employment. In threatening to move their operations to other jurisdictions, larger firms, and specifically MNEs, may be able to extract greater tax deductions. This results in a regressive ETR schedule for MNEs and NEs. Second, MNEs face arguably lower costs to relocate their business (or profits) to foreign countries with a lower tax rate than NEs. This improves MNEs' threat point in bargaining and enables them further to extract higher tax deductions than NEs. To empirically quantify the importance of bargaining on the tax gap between MNEs and NEs, it is elemental to rigorously condition on the determinants of MNE status, profit taxation, as well as possible profit-shifting activities. To that end, we use French firm-level data and entropy balancing on the joint determinants of MNE status (including the possibility of profit shifting) and a firm's ETR. We find that the empirical regressivity of the French tax schedule reduces French MNEs' ETRs by 2.52 percentage points on average due to their larger size, while the relocation threat of the same firms reduces their ETR by 3.58 percentage points relative to comparable NEs. The former is a tax advantage that any firm (MNE or NE) of the same size could obtain, while the latter is specific to MNEs and beyond the reach of NEs.","Egger, Peter H. & Strecker, Nora M. & Zoller-Rydzek, Benedikt, 2020.

Journal of International Economics,"A tale of two property rights: Knowledge, physical assets, and multinational firm boundaries","['Kukharskyy, Bohdan']","The theory of multinational firm boundaries has been shaped by two major paradigms: an earlier one, emphasizing the role of integration in preventing the dissipation of knowledge, and a more recent one, stressing the role of firm boundaries in mitigating underinvestments into relationship-specific assets in the face of contractual incompleteness. This paper develops a novel model encompassing both approaches in a unifying framework. The model predicts that the attractiveness of integration increases in the importance of the parent firm's knowledge capital and decreases in the importance of the affiliate's physical capital in a joint production process. Furthermore, stronger intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in the affiliate's country is predicted to mitigate the effect of knowledge intensity on the attractiveness of integration. I test these hypotheses using unique panel data on more than 100,000 firm pairs worldwide. In line with the model's predictions, knowledge-intensive parent firms choose higher ownership shares in their affiliates, yet this relationship is less pronounced the stronger the IPR protection in the affiliate's country. In addition, higher physical capital intensity of the affiliate is associated with lower ownership shares. These findings are robust to controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across countries, industries, and firms, providing strong support for the unifying theory of multinational firm boundaries.","Kukharskyy, Bohdan, 2020.

Trade induces specialization, thus increasing economies' exposure to idiosyncratic supply shocks. But greater geographic diversification in trade destinations offers natural hedging properties against demand shocks. In this paper, we offer an integrated economic and econometric view of the impact of trade on firms and countries volatility. Exporters' volatility is shown to directly depend on the (lack of) diversification in their portfolio of clients. Indeed, most exporters, including the largest, have one or two main clients that dwarf the others. This structure of trade networks implies that individual exporters are strongly exposed to microeconomic demand shocks. The concentration of trade flows further implies that such risk does not wash out across firms, thus contributing to aggregate fluctuations.","Kramarz, Francis & Martin, Julien & Mejean, Isabelle, 2020.

The redistribution scheme is financed by a progressive income tax and gives the same absolute transfer to all individuals. Ceteris paribus, international trade leads to an increase in income per capita but also to higher income inequality on two fronts. Inter-group inequality between managers and workers increases, and intra-group inequality within the group of managers goes up as well. We show that for a given tax rate, there is an endogenous increase in the size of the welfare state that works against the increase in inequality, yet cannot offset it.

Journal of International Economics,Imported inputs and the gains from trade,"['Ramanarayanan, Ananth']","This paper characterizes how plant-level heterogeneity in imported input use affects the aggregate welfare gains from trade. Heterogeneous plants choose a fraction of inputs to source from the lowest cost source country, with the rest purchased domestically. Sourcing more inputs requires higher up-front fixed costs, but reduces variable input costs, so import shares are increasing in plant size. Welfare gains are inversely proportional to the general equilibrium elasticity of the aggregate import share with respect to variable trade costs. A standard bilateral gravity regression underestimates this elasticity by not capturing the effects of trade costs on the input sourcing decision. The welfare gains from trade in the model are therefore lower than the gains implied by a gravity-based estimate of the trade elasticity. When calibrated to Chilean plant-level data, this difference is substantial.","Ramanarayanan, Ananth, 2020.

The model is used to (a) evaluate the impact of requiring the South to fulfill its key WTO obligation of instituting patent protection and (b) to address the role of two major flexibilities that WTO members enjoy with respect to their patent policies: the freedom to implement exhaustion policies of their choosing and the right to use compulsory licensing (CL) subject to certain stipulations. Two forces drive the model: how much the firm invests in R&D and whether or not selling in the South maximizes its global profit. CL improves consumer access in the South and can even raise innovation and global welfare. Provided the South implements patent protection, innovation and welfare are higher if the North follows national as opposed to international exhaustion. However, the South's incentive for patent protection is not necessarily stronger under national exhaustion. Not only is CL more likely to be used under international exhaustion, the welfare gain resulting from its application is also higher relative to that under national exhaustion.","Bond, Eric W. & Saggi, Kamal, 2020.

We calibrate the model so as to reproduce, among other things, the volatility and persistence of primary commodity prices and show that it delivers equilibrium real exchange rates that are as volatile and persistent as they are in the data. The model rationalizes an empirical strategy to identify the fraction of the variance in real exchange rates that can be accounted for by the underlying shocks, even if those shocks are not observable. We use this strategy to argue that shocks that move primary commodity prices account for a large fraction of the volatility of real exchange rates in the data. Our analysis implies that existing models used to analyze real exchange rates between large economies that mostly focus on trade between differentiated final goods could benefit, in terms of matching the behavior of real exchange rates, by also considering trade in primary commodities.","Ayres, Joao & Hevia, Constantino & Nicolini, Juan Pablo, 2020.

However, RoOs distort exporters' sourcing decisions and burden them with red tape.

At equilibrium, there are three types of reform paths. A country can undergo a full-scale, lasting reform, can carry out a partial but lasting reform, or can go through cycles of reforms and costly counter-reforms. Domestic institutions, along with the incentives provided by international organizations, determine the equilibrium path. A politically myopic international organization may induce cycles of reforms and costly counter-reforms, thereby reducing the country's well-being. An international organization that only provides funds to promote reforms may have a less beneficial effect than one that assists the country with fresh funds to defend reforms when there is a risk of reversal.

It covers 210 acquisition cases where an acquired plant is observed two years before and at least three years after an ownership change and for which a carefully selected control plant exists. The results suggest that while foreign ownership increases the overall energy usage due to expansion of output, it decreases the plant's energy intensity.

We find that shocks to the trend play an important role in generating a Sudden Stop followed by a slow recovery, a result that is also supported by the data.

We first build a relationship-specific investment model to guide and provide insights to our empirical work. Then we take China's accession to the WTO as a quasi-natural experiment for trade liberalization to test the theoretical predictions. Consistent with the model, we find that a decrease in tariffs on the target industry's outputs reduces vertical integrations, but a decrease in tariffs on the target industry's inputs increases vertical integrations. The findings are robust to various specifications of the empirical model and measurements of the variables. We further show that underinvestment problem is an important mechanism to understanding the effects of tariff reductions on firms' organizational choices.","Liu, Qing & Qiu, Larry D. & Zhan, Chaoqun, 2019.

Journal of International Economics,Trading off the income gains and the inequality costs of trade policy,"['Artuc, Erhan', 'Porto, Guido', 'Rijkers, Bob']","This paper characterizes the trade-off between the income gains and the inequality costs of trade using survey data for 54 developing countries. Tariff data on agricultural and manufacturing goods are combined with household survey data on detailed income and expenditure patterns to estimate the first-order effects of the elimination of import tariffs on household welfare. The paper assesses how these welfare effects vary across the distribution by estimating impacts on the consumption of traded goods, wage income, farm and non-farm family enterprise income, and government transfers. For each country, the income gains and the inequality costs of trade liberalization are quantified and the trade-offs between them are assessed using an Atkinson social welfare index. The analysis finds average income gains from import tariff liberalization in 45 countries and average income losses in nine countries. Across countries in the sample, the gains from trade are 1.9% of real household expenditure on average. We find overwhelming evidence of a trade-off between the income gains (losses) and the inequality costs (gains), which arise because trade tends to exacerbate income inequality: 45 countries face a trade-off, while only nine do not. The income gains typically more than offset the increase in inequality. In the majority of developing countries, the prevailing tariff structure thus induces sizable welfare losses.","Artuc, Erhan & Porto, Guido & Rijkers, Bob, 2019.

Using French data, we show that this homotheticity property is soundly rejected: larger firms concentrate their import spending on their top varieties, holding the sourcing strategy fixed. To rationalize this finding, we propose a novel model of importing that features (i) a complementarity between firm productivity and input quality and (ii) heterogeneity across countries in their ability to produce high quality inputs. This model implies that large firms bias their spending towards countries with a comparative advantage in producing high quality inputs and hence generates a non-homothetic import demand system.

This increase is observed with both tax hikes and spending cuts, and is smaller when the consolidation is large. The cost of credit goes up with tax hikes that apply to a particular sector, but not with spending cuts that are directed at a certain sector. Firms that face higher costs tend to be small, highly leveraged, domestic, government dependent, and financially constrained. Hence, there may be costs associated with fiscal consolidations—beyond the aggregate-demand channel—borne primarily by firms operating in sectors directly affected by the consolidation measures and by those that have limited access to international markets and alternative financing sources.","Ağca, Şenay & Igan, Deniz, 2019.

Contrary to existing studies, we use a search-and-matching setting that allows to endogenize the employment structure and the wage differentials between different skill groups in the same sector, and between workers with identical skills employed in different sectors. Theoretically, the brain drain induces ambiguous welfare effects for those left behind as the potential loss/gain depends on the parameters of the model. We thus parameterize our model on 33 sub-Saharan African countries and produce comparative results for each of them. We find that skilled emigration induces heterogeneous welfare losses for the low-skilled population. The size of these losses varies between 0.2 and 8%, and is influenced by the parameters of the production and education technologies. The results are fairly robust to identifying assumptions, to the inclusion of technological externalities, and to the endogenization of training decisions.","Docquier, Frédéric & Iftikhar, Zainab, 2019.

This allows us to estimate a difference-in-difference empirical specification based on variation across Chinese prefectures before and after 2001. We find that prefectures facing the average decline in trade policy uncertainty experienced a 24% increase in their internal in-migration rate – this result is driven by migrants who are “non-hukou”, skilled, and in their prime working age. Finally, in those prefectures, working hours of “native” unskilled workers significantly increased, and internal migrants found employment in the places they migrated to.","Facchini, Giovanni & Liu, Maggie Y. & Mayda, Anna Maria & Zhou, Minghai, 2019.

We use ‘disadvantaged’ to refer to countries with smaller market size, worse state of technology (in terms of higher innovation and production costs), and worse geography (in terms of more remoteness from other countries). We show that, in a global welfare perspective, optimal multilateral trade policy should: promote the sales of low cost firms to all countries, but especially to disadvantaged ones; trim the sales of high cost firms to all countries, but especially to disadvantaged ones; reduce firm entry in all countries, but especially in disadvantaged ones. This would not only restore efficiency but also reduce welfare inequality between advantaged and disadvantaged countries if their differences in market size, state of technology and geography are large enough.","Nocco, Antonella & Ottaviano, Gianmarco I.P. & Salto, Matteo, 2019.

The trade partisan conflict index tracks the evolution of political disagreement among policymakers on topics such as tariffs, subsidies, and trade agreements as reported by the media. Using data from 1985 to 2016, I show that an innovation of the TPCI is associated with a significant decline in FDI flows to the US.

Journal of International Economics,Multinational production and comparative advantage,"['Alviarez, Vanessa']","This paper shows analytically and quantitatively how omitting the striking sectoral heterogeneity of multinational production (MP) and its relationship with countries' comparative advantage leads to understate the gains from MP and openness. By construction, one-sector models of trade and MP, ignore the conflicting effects that a reduction in MP frictions has on the sectoral dispersion of MP and trade shares. On the one hand, freer MP increases the dispersion of MP shares across sectors, and with it, the gains from MP. On the other hand, it reduces the heterogeneity of trade shares, since MP erodes sectoral level Ricardian comparative advantage, diminishing therefore gains from trade. These effects are driven by the disproportional allocation of MP in industries where local firms are relatively less productive, which generates an uneven productivity boost favoring comparative disadvantage sectors, lowering the differences in observed sectoral productivities. To assess the welfare implications of this mechanism, this paper assembles a novel industry-level dataset of bilateral foreign affiliate sales for 32 countries, 9 tradable sectors and 4 non-tradeble sectors.","Alviarez, Vanessa, 2019.

A key element is that financial frictions facing the economy pertain to both lending and borrowing abroad, and the process of financial liberalization is specified in terms of reducing these frictions. We emphasize two key channels through which liberalization affects inequality. The first is by reducing the costs of investing and borrowing abroad. Since these activities favor the wealthy, they tend to increase inequality. But, in addition, these two forms of liberalization have sharply contrasting effects on domestic activity causing contrasting impacts on inequality. Numerical simulations suggest that income inequality is more sensitive to financial liberalization that favors foreign investment than if it is directed to reducing foreign borrowing costs. The simulations also suggest that the overall liberalization that occurred during 1970–2015, accounted for a significant fraction of the increase in income inequality experienced over that period.

Then we empirically study the effect of the 2007 WTO accession on selection, competition, and productivity. Our results show that WTO entry is associated with higher probability of exit, lower firm profitability, and substantial increases in productivity for private firms but not for SOEs. Our estimates suggest that the overall productivity gains would have been about 40% larger in a counterfactual Vietnamese economy without SOEs. We highlight some economic mechanisms possibly driving these findings through the lenses of a model of trade with heterogeneous private and state-owned firms. The model suggests that political/regulatory barriers to entry and access to credit are key drivers of the different response of SOEs to trade liberalization. Further empirical tests broadly validate these insights.","Baccini, Leonardo & Impullitti, Giammario & Malesky, Edmund J., 2019.

In a two-country model where trade costs allow for international market segmentation, we show that endogenous pricing-to-market behavior of firms acts as an important transmission channel of the policies. By strengthening the degree of competition between firms, product market deregulation at home leads to a reduction in domestic markups, which generally leads to an improvement in the international competitiveness of the Home country. Conversely, the power of competitive tax policy to depreciate the real exchange rate is dampened, as domestic firms take the opportunity of the labor tax cut to increase their markups. The variability of markups also affects the normative implications of the reforms. This indicates the importance of taking into account endogenous pricing-to-market behavior when intending to correctly evaluate the overall effects of the reforms.","Patureau, Lise & Poilly, Céline, 2019.

We find that import competition has a large negative impact on individual mental health. Compared to a worker employed in the industry at the 25th percentile of the import competition distribution, a worker employed in the industry at the 75th percentile would need a yearly monetary compensation of £270 to make up for her greater utility loss. We find import competition to have larger effects on the right tail of the mental distress distribution, thereby increasing inequality in mental health not only across but also within industries. We show that this is consistent with import competition disproportionately hitting specific groups of workers in an industry, such as the youngest or those with a large family, a poor financial condition, a short job tenure, a temporary contract, and a blue-collar or tradable job. Using information on family ties, we find that import competition has negative spillovers to other family members. In particular, women's mental distress increases as a consequence of the import competition faced by their partners. Moreover, paternal import competition leads to reduced investment in child rearing and worsened children's self-esteem and life satisfaction. Finally, we provide evidence that import competition is likely to work through a complex set of channels. These include observable labor market outcomes such as higher likelihood of job displacement and lower wage growth, but also reduced job satisfaction and gloomier expectations about the future.","Colantone, Italo & Crinò, Rosario & Ogliari, Laura, 2019.

Using an Eaton and Gersovitz (1981) model of debt repudiation, we show that the Brownian part explains the counter-cyclical behavior of the current account, and the Poisson part explains the risk of default—thus enabling our model to account for key stylized facts regarding sovereign risk.","Carré, Sylvain & Cohen, Daniel & Villemot, Sébastien, 2019.

Relying on a model of joint household labor supply decisions, we quantitatively analyze the role of non-linear labor income taxes for explaining the evolution of hours worked of married couples over time, using as inputs the full country- and year-specific statutory labor income tax codes. We further evaluate the role of consumption taxes, gender and educational wage premia, and the educational composition. The model is quite successful in replicating the time series behavior of hours worked per employed married woman, with labor income taxes being the key driving force. It does however capture only part of the secular increase in married women's employment rates in the 1980s and early 1990s, suggesting an important role for factors not considered in this paper.

The share of full foreign acquisitions is higher in sectors more reliant on external finance, in countries with lower financial development, and in countries with higher institutional quality.

To control for endogeneity bias due to selection into foreign ownership, we combine a difference-in-differences approach with a propensity score weighting estimator.

To pin down the mechanism, we exploit unique information on whether firms use their foreign parent in exporting to foreign markets. Our results suggest a fundamental role for market access through the foreign parent in explaining skill upgrading in foreign-acquired firms. We reveal substantial productivity gains within foreign-acquired firms and we show that these gains derive from a concurrent effort to raise worker skills and adopt more advanced technology, suggesting a skill bias in technological innovations.

Journal of International Economics,A sorted tale of globalization: White collar jobs and the rise of service offshoring,"['Liu, Runjuan', 'Trefler, Daniel']","We study how the rise of unaffiliated trade in services with China and India has impacted U.S. labour markets. The topic has two understudied aspects: it deals with service trade (most studies deal with manufacturing trade) and it examines the historical first of U.S. workers competing with educated but low-wage foreign workers. Our empirical agenda is made complicated by the endogeneity of service imports and the endogenous sorting of workers across occupations. To develop an estimation framework that deals with these, we imbed a partial equilibrium model of ‘trade in tasks’ within a general equilibrium model of occupational choice. The model highlights the need to estimate labour market outcomes using changes in the outcomes of individual workers and, in particular, to distinguish workers who switch ‘up’ from those who switch ‘down’. (Switching ‘down’ means switching to an occupation that pays less on average than the current occupation). We apply these insights to matched CPS data for 1996–2007. The cumulative 10-year impact of rising service imports from China and India has been as follows. (1) Downward occupational switching increased by 7 percentage points, from 21% to 28%, and upward occupational switching increased by 6 percentage points, from 17% to 23%. (2) Transitions to unemployment were imprecisely measured to have increased by half a percentage point, potentially raising the white-collar unemployment rate from 3.0% to 3.5%. (3) The earnings average across all white collar workers fell by a small 1%. However, for the sub-population of workers who switched down or became unemployed, earnings fell by 15% and 47%, respectively. (4) Service exports had partially offsetting effects on switching and unemployment.","Liu, Runjuan & Trefler, Daniel, 2019.

This paper uses 1992–2011 employment data from U.S. establishments to construct job flows at both the industry and commuting-zone levels, and then estimates the impact of the ‘China shock’ on each job-flow type. Using the two most influential measures of Chinese exposure, we find that the China shock affects U.S. employment mainly through deaths of establishments. At the commuting-zone level, we find evidence of large job reallocation from the Chinese-competition exposed sector to the nonexposed sector. Moreover, we demonstrate that the job-flow effects of the China shock are fundamentally different from those of a more general adverse shock affecting the U.S. demand for domestic labor.","Asquith, Brian & Goswami, Sanjana & Neumark, David & Rodriguez-Lopez, Antonio, 2019.

(ii) Medium-productivity firms offshore skill-intensive inputs to skill-abundant countries and are more labor intensive in their domestic production than non-importers. (iii) Higher-productivity firms additionally offshore labor-intensive inputs to labor-abundant countries and are more skill intensive than non-importers. We develop a model in which heterogeneous firms, subject to fixed costs, can offshore intermediate inputs of different skill intensities to countries with different skill abundance. This leads to endogenous within-industry variation in domestic skill intensities. We provide econometric evidence supporting the factor-proportions channel through which reductions in offshoring costs to labor-abundant countries have significantly increased firm-level skill intensities of French manufacturers.","Carluccio, Juan & Cuñat, Alejandro & Fadinger, Harald & Fons-Rosen, Christian, 2019.

Such claim is substantiated by a strong negative relationship between economic activity and an external financial indicator that we construct for several EMEs using micro-level data on spreads of bonds issued by EMEs' corporations in foreign capital markets. Three salient features characterize such a negative relationship. First, the financial indicator has considerable predictive power on future economic activity in these economies, even after controlling for other potential drivers of business cycles such as movements in sovereign spreads and global financial risk, among others. Second, on average, an identified adverse shock to the financial indicator generates a large and protracted fall of real output growth in these economies, and up to 14% of its forecast error variance is associated to this shock. Lastly, fluctuations in this indicator also respond strongly to shocks in global financial risk emanating from world capital markets, thereby implying that changes in corporate spreads also serve as a powerful propagating mechanism of the effect of changes in global investors' risk appetite in emerging markets.","Caballero, Julián & Fernández, Andrés & Park, Jongho, 2019.

The systemic risk metrics also decline with respect to expansion, though results for the competition channel are more mixed, suggesting that systemic risk is more likely to be affected by country or business models characteristics that go beyond and above the differential intensity of competition between source and host markets.

Interacting firm importing shares by country with real exchange rates (RER), we obtain a cost shifter that varies across firms and is arguably orthogonal to product quality. We use this import weighted RER as an instrument for export prices and we identify firm-level quality from residual export variations, after controlling for prices. Our quality estimates correlate to firm characteristics (e.g. wages) and to alternative measures of quality available for some rare sectors. Moreover, we document cases in which our estimates more adequately characterize quality compared to prices, a popular proxy for quality. We show for instance that firms add products to their export portfolio when their quality increases, as expected, while simultaneously their prices decrease. This suggests that our empirical strategy, by delivering quality estimates which, unlike prices, are not polluted with productivity variations, should contribute to future research on the link between firm-level product quality and globalization.","Piveteau, Paul & Smagghue, Gabriel, 2019.

Traditional currency-crisis models provide an unambiguous answer: No. We argue that this answer stems from the models' narrow focus on how a central bank's resistance to private-sector pressure affects output and inflation in the short run. The answer may reverse if pegging is a commitment device, serving to address domestic credibility issues in the long run by transferring the conduct of monetary policy abroad.

However, the effects of such measures on the core objectives of monetary policy to stabilise output and inflation are largely unknown. In this paper we quantify the effects of changes in maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios on output and inflation. We rely on a narrative identification approach based on detailed reading of policy-makers' objectives when implementing the measures. We find that over a four year horizon, a 10 percentage point decrease in the maximum LTV ratio leads to a 1.1% reduction in output. As a rule of thumb, the impact of a 10 percentage point LTV tightening can be viewed as roughly comparable to that of a 25 basis point increase in the policy rate. However, the effects are imprecisely estimated and the effect is only present in emerging market economies. We also find that tightening LTV limits has larger economic effects than loosening them. At the same time, we show that changes in maximum LTV ratios have substantial effects on credit and house price growth. Using inverse propensity weights to rerandomise LTV actions, we show that these effects are likely causal.","Richter, Björn & Schularick, Moritz & Shim, Ilhyock, 2019.

As expected, our measures of trade costs are higher on average for service industries. However, there is considerable variation across industries within sectors.

Using a local labor market approach, we investigate the causal effects of tariff reforms implemented in South Africa between 1994 and 2004 on labor market outcomes at the individual level. More specifically, we construct a district-level measure of exposure to tariff reductions equal to a weighted average of industry tariffs using baseline industry shares as weights, and estimate the effect of this shock on local economies. We find that workers in districts facing larger tariff reductions experience a significant decline in both formal and informal employment in the tradable sector, driven primarily by a decline in manufacturing employment, relative to workers in districts less exposed to these reductions. There is no evidence of any significant effect on wages for those who remain employed. However, displaced workers do not show any evidence of transitions into other sectors, or migration to less affected regions; rather, they are more likely to become discouraged workers or exit the labor force entirely, and show an increased probability of accessing government transfers.","Erten, Bilge & Leight, Jessica & Tregenna, Fiona, 2019.

Journal of International Economics,Anti-foreign bias in the court: Welfare explanation and evidence from Canadian intellectual property litigations,"['Mai, Joseph', 'Stoyanov, Andrey']","Are judges concerned, in the same way as policy makers, with the effects of their decisions on national welfare? In this paper, we analyze this question by examining the outcomes of intellectual property rights (IPR) litigations between domestic and foreign firms. We use a simple model of oligopoly, in which IPR takes the form of a more efficient production technology, to illustrate how antiforeign bias varies across cases when judges have welfare concerns. The predictions of the model are tested using data on all Canadian IPR cases over a four-year period. We find that foreign firms have about 25 percentage points lower probability of protecting their IPR in Canadian courts relative to domestic firms. We also find that courts' decisions are aligned with national welfare maximization principles so that foreign firms are less likely to win in those cases when the implied welfare gains from not protecting foreign IPR are greater. These findings are robust to controlling for endogenous selection of firms into litigation.","Mai, Joseph & Stoyanov, Andrey, 2019.

In the low-growth regime, there is higher probability of loss of private benefits due to turnover, which makes the sovereign behave more myopically.

The optimal policy is to tranch the risky fiscal capacity and then to issue state-contingent assets that pay only when the need for aggregate liquidity in the economy is high. In this way, governments can minimize wasted liquidity of public assets: unused returns on public assets not required by domestic investors. This minimizes the cost of liquidity hoarding for the domestic private sector, which increases investment and welfare in the economy. This study also provides a framework to analyze relevant comparative statics regarding the ownership of state-contingent public assets. In particular, the model assesses the effects of changes in the domestic liquidity needs, the state's fiscal capacity, and the foreign willingness to pay for public debt on the ownership of state-contingent public assets.","Gomez-Gonzalez, Patricia, 2019.

We show that a model with trade in goods and endogenously segmented asset markets can account for this puzzling discrepancy. Active households—who pay a fixed cost to transfer money into or out of assets—share risk within and across countries, and their marginal utility growth prices assets, so asset prices imply high risk sharing. Inactive households consume their current income and do not share risk, so aggregate consumption (which averages across all households) reflects lower risk sharing.

Anticipated shocks are identified as the expected change in the Fed Funds rate orthogonal to expected U.S. business cycle conditions while unanticipated shocks are the one-step ahead forecast error. Anticipated shocks explain around half of the narrative series of U.S. monetary policy shocks. To identify the effects of both shocks, I estimate a Panel VAR using a sample of emerging economies. An anticipated 25 basis points contractionary U.S. interest rate shock induces a fall of 0.5% in GDP from its trend two quarters before the shock materializes. Both anticipated and unanticipated changes in the U.S. interest rate cause significant and quantitatively similar effects. The increase of the U.S. BAA corporate spread in response to both shocks significantly exacerbates the response of emerging economies.

Optimal transfers involve a tradeoff between reducing national output gaps and the provision of consumption insurance across countries, where the weight of the former increases relative to the latter as consumption home bias rises. The welfare gains from optimal transfers increase in wage rigidity and trade elasticities and are particularly large when risk-sharing through financial markets breaks down. For the average euro area economy, the welfare gains from optimal transfers range from 0.50% of permanent consumption under complete markets and low wage rigidity to 6.09% of permanent consumption under financial autarky and high wage rigidity.","Dmitriev, Mikhail & Hoddenbagh, Jonathan, 2019.

This trade reducing effect is driven by developing countries and by refusals without any product sample analysis, in particular during the Subprime Crisis and its aftermath.

We use a standard small open economy model with time-intensive international trade, calibrated to match key features of U.S. data and disciplining the variation in the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution using asset price data. We find that variation in the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution helps rationalize puzzling features of import fluctuations and that this mechanism is quantitatively important during both normal and crisis times.","Leibovici, Fernando & Waugh, Michael E., 2019.

This paper develops a more realistic model of incomplete markets, where there is international trade in multiple assets. The analysis shows that the presence of multiple assets creates a potentially powerful interaction between monetary policy and household portfolio allocation. This interaction is, by definition, not present when there is financial autarky or a single tradeable bond and this paper shows that the interaction with portfolio allocation can imply that optimal monetary policy generates a quantitatively much more significant stabilisation of the real exchange rate gap than implied by simpler models of financial market incompleteness.","Senay, Ozge & Sutherland, Alan, 2019.

Should service workers in developed countries worry about their jobs? Trade theory has given a nuanced answer to this question, suggesting that efficiency gains from offshoring may counteract direct job losses, which leaves the predicted net effect ambiguous. This paper investigates the employment effects of service offshoring in a newly combined and exceptionally detailed panel dataset, covering almost the entire universe of German firms' service imports over the years 2001–2013. It exploits firm-specific export supply shocks by partner countries and service types as an instrumental variable to find that service offshoring has increased firm employment.

Evidence from French employer-employee data,"['Bombardini, Matilde', 'Orefice, Gianluca', 'Tito, Maria D.']","This paper documents a novel fact about the hiring decisions of exporting firms versus non-exporting firms in a French matched employer-employee dataset. We construct the type of each worker using both a traditional wage regression and a theory-based approach and compute measures of the average worker type and worker type dispersion at the firm level. We find that exporting firms feature a lower type dispersion in the pool of workers they hire. This effect is quantitatively larger than the common finding in the literature that exporters pay higher wages because, among other factors, they employ better workers. The matching between exporting firms and workers is even tighter in sectors characterized by better exporting opportunities as measured by foreign demand or tariff shocks. Our findings are consistent with a model of matching between heterogeneous workers and firms in which variation in the worker type at the firm level exists in equilibrium only because of the presence of search costs. When firms gain access to the foreign market, matching with the right worker becomes particularly important because deviations from the ideal match quickly reduce the higher potential value of the relationship. Hence, exporting firms select sets of workers that are less dispersed relative to the average. This analysis is suggestive of the presence of additional gains from trade due to improved sorting.","Bombardini, Matilde & Orefice, Gianluca & Tito, Maria D., 2019.

To explain this finding we present an open-economy real business cycle model with stochastic growth rates in which higher uncertainty of the expected income stream increases the precautionary savings of households.

Recent advances in the measurement of such shocks and their large realizations in the recent financial crisis produce a suitable quasi-natural experiment for studying this relation. Toward this end, I use ERR classification data for a panel of 40 emerging market economies (EMEs) to establish the following main findings: output responds significantly more adversely to contractionary global credit supply shocks in the fixed ERR than in the non-fixed ERR; deleveraging and the fall in imports are much more severe in the fixed ERR; and the lack of exchange rate depreciation in the fixed ERR is accompanied by a stronger fall in exports. These results are broadly consistent with predictions from models which include both the expenditure-switching channel and the balance sheet channel of exchange rate depreciation, where the latter channel effectively becomes expansionary, rather than contractionary as commonly thought, owing to favorable effects of the expenditure-switching channel on balance sheets' asset side.","Ben Zeev, Nadav, 2019.

The empirical analysis is based on micro data of German firms and their operations at home and abroad, including information on investment in fixed assets. The empirical approach, which rests upon extensive and intensive margin variation, is shown to produce very robust results. These suggest a positive relationship between foreign and home investment in real capital. This positive effect seems to be mainly related to additional opportunities for tax planning and better access to financing capital. In contrast, we do not find evidence that improved production processes and technology upgrading cause the positive effect on investment at home. Our empirical approach allows us to distinguish between an extensive and intensive margin effect: setting up a new foreign affiliate leads to an immediate positive effect of about EUR 460,000 additional investment; the investment elasticity at the intensive margin is estimated to be approximately 0.13.","Goldbach, Stefan & Nagengast, Arne J. & Steinmüller, Elias & Wamser, Georg, 2019.

Journal of International Economics,Ownership Structure and Productivity of Multinationals,"['Bircan, Çağatay']","We examine the ownership structure and productivity of multinational affiliates and their effects on domestic industry. We first separate plant-level efficiency into a physical productivity and a price component. Multinationals target plants with high prices and markups. Upon acquisition they raise physical productivity but lower prices, leaving markups unchanged, especially when they are majority owners. This pro-competitive effect means that multinationals' productivity effects may be previously under-estimated. Multinational presence in an industry increases physical productivity while lowering prices at domestic firms, especially when majority-owned affiliates are present. Ownership structure and foreign acquisitions therefore play an important role in driving aggregate productivity growth.","Bircan, Çağatay, 2019.

To understand why, we build and estimate an open economy model of the Gold Standard, which allows us to quantitatively assess the importance of three channels of external adjustment: flexible prices, international migration, and monetary policy.

Using a rich dataset on Belgian firms for the period 1995–2005, we show that: i) firms are much more likely to source services and goods inputs from the same origin country rather than from different ones; ii) joint imports are associated with higher firm productivity; iii) increases in barriers to imports of goods reduce firm-level imports of services from the same market, and conversely. We build upon a discrete-choice model of goods and services input sourcing that can reproduce these facts to guide our econometric strategy. We use our results to quantify the impact of reductions in goods and services barriers between the US and the EU. Our findings have important implications for the design of trade policy.

I provide a novel structural explanation for these facts using a model with dispersed information among firms. When producers face strategic complementarities in price-setting, uncertainty about competitors' beliefs results in sluggish price adjustment that can generate large and long-lived real exchange rate movements. I estimate the model using data from the US and Euro Area, and show that it successfully explains the unconditional volatility and persistence of the real exchange rate. The model also accounts for the persistent and hump-shaped real exchange rate behavior conditional on nominal disturbances documented by a structural VAR. About 50% of this persistence is due to the inertial dynamics of higher-order beliefs.","Candian, Giacomo, 2019.

We first identify 908 unique estimates of the effects of FTAs on different trading pairs for the years 1986–2006. We then employ these estimates as our dependent variable in a “second stage” analysis characterizing the heterogeneity in these effects. Interestingly, most of this heterogeneity (∼2/3) occurs within FTAs (rather than across different FTAs), with asymmetric effects within pairs (on exports vs. imports) also playing an important role. Our second stage analysis provides several intuitive explanations behind these variations. Even within the same agreement, FTA effects are weaker for more distant pairs and for pairs with otherwise high levels of ex ante trade frictions. The effects of new FTAs are similarly weaker for pairs with existing agreements already in place. In addition, we are able to relate asymmetries in FTA effects to each country's ability to influence the other's terms of trade. Out-of-sample predictions incorporating these insights enable us to predict direction-specific effects of future FTAs between any pair of countries.

In this model, firms face uncertainty about their own foreign demand, and they update their beliefs based on individual export transactions according to Bayes' rule. I estimate the model using data on firm-level production and transaction-level exports to Germany in the Chinese ceramics and glass industry. The empirical results show substantial heterogeneity in productivity and demand belief. For experienced firms, productivity is the major driving force of export participation. In contrast, for potential entrants, demand learning plays a more important role. A counterfactual exercise suggests that trade cost reduction has a significant impact on stimulating the export participation of potential entrants. Importantly, more than half of the participation increase is attributed to firms' endogenous reaction to demand learning in the foreign market.","Li, Shengyu, 2018.

This dataset allows us to consider firm-level involvement in processing trade and firm-level dynamics in both export and import markets. Key findings of our firm-level estimations of trade elasticities include that the response of Chinese firms to exchanges rate changes depends strongly on the extent to which firms are involved in processing trade, i.e. heterogeneity in the extent of processing trade is crucial to understanding trade elasticities, and that the Chinese trade balance responds strongly to changes in the relative value of the Chinese Yuan, thereby implying that the influence of exchange rates on trade flows is significant and that currency depreciations do in fact lead to export growth and trade balance improvement.","Fatum, Rasmus & Liu, Runjuan & Tong, Jiadong & Xu, Jiayun, 2018.

Bank linkages are measured for each pair of countries in each year as a number of bank pairs in these two countries that are connected through cross-border syndicated lending. Using a gravity approach to model trade for 66 countries over 24 years with a full set of fixed effects (source-year, target-year, source-target), we find that new connections between banks in a given country-pair lead to an increase in trade flows between these countries in the following year and to trade diversions from countries competing for similar imports. We conjecture that the mechanism for this effect is the role bank linkages play in reducing export risk and present evidence supporting this conjecture. In particular, using industry-level trade data and controlling for country-pair-year and industry fixed effects, we find that new bank linkages have larger impacts on trade in industries which tend to be subject to more export risk. For U.S. banks, we can show that bank linkages are positively associated with foreign letter of credit exposures.","Caballero, Julian & Candelaria, Christopher & Hale, Galina, 2018.

We use Canadian retailer and traveler data from 1986 to 2007 to estimate the model. Consistent with the model, the empirical results indicate that an appreciation of the Canadian dollar substantially increases Canadians' cross border travel which has a significant negative effect on the sales of Canadian retailers. These effects diminish with the distance to the nearest US shopping destination, relative population and the median income of the community in which the retailer operates. Using counterfactual experiments, we quantify the positive effects on Canadian retailers' sales of more restrictive border controls after September 2001, and the negative effects on those sales of increased Canadian duty free allowances and the expansion of US shopping opportunities.","Baggs, Jen & Fung, Loretta & Lapham, Beverly, 2018.

The export price elasticity is the highest, around 5, much larger than the exchange rate elasticity. The international elasticity puzzle is therefore worse than previously thought.

Moreover, a strong real exchange rate appreciation is key for an unexpected commodity price increase to induce a tightening of labour market conditions in the model that is in line with the empirical evidence. As in the case of technology shocks discussed by Shimer (2005), proper amplification of the commodity price shock requires a high value of the outside option for unemployed agents.

Consistent with empirical evidence, adverse shocks to comparative advantage lead to labor income losses for import-competition-exposed workers; with incomplete markets, these workers are imperfectly insured and experience welfare losses. A progressive tax system is valuable, as it substitutes for imperfect insurance and redistributes the gains from trade. However, it also reduces the incentives for labor to reallocate away from comparatively disadvantaged locations. We find that optimal progressivity should increase with openness to trade with a ten percentage point increase in openness necessitating a five percentage point increase in marginal tax rates for those at the top of the income distribution.","Lyon, Spencer G. & Waugh, Michael E., 2018.

The WTO Information Technology Agreement's (ITA) unique setting allows us to overcome the challenges associated with identifying effects of non-discriminatory trade policies due to two reasons: (i) ITA constitutes a quasi-natural experiment of several “passive” signatories joining the agreement as an unavoidable part of pursuing a larger policy objective, and (ii) ITA's partial coverage of the IT sector provides a natural control group for identification based on cross-product variation. Our analysis finds novel nonlinear impacts of tariff liberalization: Complete tariff elimination results in large additional trade gains – over and above tariff reductions – especially for intermediate goods. The commitment to durable tariff elimination, through WTO bindings, adds another two layers, boosting both imports and exports more than equivalent unilateral reforms. This commitment spurned development of a downstream IT export sector in “passive” signatories.","Gnutzmann-Mkrtchyan, Arevik & Henn, Christian, 2018.

Defaults may arise from negative income shocks, government impatience or a “sunspot”-coordinated buyers strike. We introduce a bailout agency, and characterize the strategy with the minimal actuarially fair intervention which guarantees the no-buyers-strike fundamental equilibrium, relying on the market for residual financing. The intervention makes it cheaper for governments to borrow, inducing them borrow more, leaving default probabilities possibly rather unchanged.

The limits to bailouts,"['Mengus, Eric']","Why does a borrowing country not avoid the internal cost of default, an important driver of sovereign debt repayment, by implementing domestic sector bailouts? This paper investigates sovereign debt sustainability in a model where domestic and foreign investors optimally select their portfolios and the sovereign decides over its default and bailout policies. It shows that internal bailouts do not preclude sovereign borrowing when domestic private exposures to sovereign debt, direct or indirect, cannot be observed or inferred by the sovereign. In equilibrium, when these exposures are correlated with future liquidity needs, bailouts are less efficient to compensate domestic losses making repayment more desirable. “Opacity"" on financial exposures is then a commitment device for sovereigns to honor their debts and thus may be welfare improving.","Mengus, Eric, 2018.

In the non-cooperative policy equilibrium both thin-capitalization rules and CFC rules are set more lenient than if tax policies were chosen cooperatively, implying an ‘excessive’ tax discrimination in favor of multinationals.

This paper studies the adjustment dynamics of the real exchange rate towards its long-run equilibrium and presents empirical evidence that capital controls increase the persistence of misalignments. Allowing the speed of adjustment to vary according to the intensity of restrictions on capital flows, it is shown that the real exchange rate converges to its long-run level at significantly slower rates in countries with capital controls. This result is stronger when the exchange rate is undervalued and is independent of confounding factors such as the exchange rate regime and other forms of heterogeneity affecting the speed of adjustment. I also find evidence that controls on capital inflows have greater effects than controls on outflows. In addition, while the combination of capital controls with a fixed or managed exchange rate regime significantly increases the persistence of misalignments, controls appear to loose traction under more flexible exchange rate arrangements.","Montecino, Juan Antonio, 2018.

Using Chinese customs transactions between 2000 and 2009, we exploit time-variation in product-level trade policy and find that Chinese firms are less likely to enter new foreign markets and more likely to exit from established foreign markets when their products are subject to increased trade policy uncertainty. Our analysis is based on the phenomenon of “tariff echoing” – after a tariff hike in one country, another country is likely to raise its tariff on the same product. Overall, we find that if there had been no trade policy uncertainty created by the use of contingent tariffs, Chinese entry into foreign markets would have been roughly 2% higher per year. We use our model to counterfactually estimate how much entry by Chinese firms over 2001–2009 was due to future trade policy certainty provided by membership in the WTO.","Crowley, Meredith & Meng, Ning & Song, Huasheng, 2018.

Using matching with difference-in-differences to address the self-selection bias, we find that inflation targeting has led to a 3–6 percentage point reduction in the foreign currency share of international debt in targeting countries when compared to non-targeting countries, with the effect especially pronounced for sovereign international debt. Differentiating by type of owner, we find a reduction of the foreign currency share in foreign-held total sovereign debt but no effect on domestic-held debt. Furthermore, from the analysis of the US dollar and euro shares, we find that inflation targeting has contributed to a 9 percentage points lower dollar share in international debt in targeting countries compared to non-targeting countries, while the effect on the euro share is negligible. This not only provides evidence that the structural features of international financial markets matter, but also that monetary policy can help developing countries reduce their reliance on foreign currency debt, especially if it is held by foreign investors.","Ogrokhina, Olena & Rodriguez, Cesar M., 2018.

This correlation is robust to local import penetration proxies and is corroborated using differences in the exposure of commuting zones to the plausibly exogenous normalization of U.S. trade relations with China in 2000. A Ricardian trade model with endogenous variable markups arising from head-to-head foreign competition can rationalize such a correlation. Following a trade liberalization shock, employment and earnings collapse in the less productive locations since they endogenously exhibit both higher trade-induced job losses and lower job creation, as in the data. When migration is muted in response to the trade shock, inequality increases across locations and induces transitional transfers towards decaying locations, even as employment and welfare rise in the aggregate.","Kondo, Illenin O., 2018.

As a new trade technology, e-commerce can increase inter-city trade and alleviate spatial consumption inequality because it (1) eliminates the fixed cost of market entry, and (2) reduces the effects of distance on trade costs. Using unique data from China's leading e-commerce platform, we provide evidence consistent with these two features: online trade is less hindered by distance relative to offline trade, and residents from smaller and more remote cities spend a larger fraction of their income online. We then build a multi-region general equilibrium model to quantify the impacts of e-commerce on domestic trade and welfare. We find that although it partially crowds out inter-city trade originally taking place offline, the emergence of e-commerce increases the aggregate domestic trade.

A consistent finding is that rising (top-end) personal inequality leads to a decrease of the current account, controlling for standard current account determinants.

We further analyze how different measures of income distribution affect the financial balances of the household, corporate and government sectors and discuss potential theoretical explanations of our findings.

We propose a new focus: directly incorporating the underlying shocks that cause exchange rate fluctuations when evaluating how these fluctuations “pass through” to import and consumer prices. A standard open-economy model shows that the relationship between exchange rates and prices depends on the shocks which cause the exchange rate to move. We build on this to develop a structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) framework for a small open economy and apply it to the UK. We show that prices respond differently to exchange rate movements based on what caused the movements. For example, exchange rate pass-through is low in response to domestic demand shocks and relatively high in response to domestic monetary policy shocks. This framework can improve our ability to estimate how pass-through can change over short periods of time. For example, it can explain why sterling's post-crisis depreciation caused a sharper increase in prices than expected, while the effect of sterling's 2013–15 appreciation was more muted. We also apply this framework to forecast the extent of pass-through from sterling's sharp depreciation corresponding to the UK's vote to leave the European Union.","Forbes, Kristin & Hjortsoe, Ida & Nenova, Tsvetelina, 2018.

Using a sub-national data over the period 1990 to 2005, the empirical analysis shows that high-skill export shocks raise both high school and college enrollments, while low-skill export shocks depress both. These relationships appear to be attributable to the association between skill premium and skill demand embodied in export shocks.

We develop a model with optimal default and monetary-union exit decisions of a small open economy. Our model can account for the behavior of sovereign bond spreads in the eurozone with the arrival of the news of Greece potentially exiting the euro in the near future. In our theoretical framework, belonging to the monetary-union entails a strong exchange rate peg, which can be abandoned only if the country exits the union. Exit is costly and the cost of exit remains unknown until the first country leaves the union. The theoretical mechanism we explore reveals that while a high expected exit-cost could improve the credibility of a monetary union, uncertainty governing exit-cost realizations could make the monetary-union members prone to surges in interest rates when rumors of a member state exiting arise. We solve the model numerically and quantify that a Grexit-rumors type of shock can triple the default likelihood of an a-priori financially healthy member state. Our framework thus provides a novel and quantitatively important explanation for the eurozone crisis.","Eijffinger, Sylvester C.W. & Kobielarz, Michał L. & Uras, Burak R., 2018.

Analyzing bilateral migrant stocks of the 15 main destination countries and 85 sending countries for the year 2000, we find that migrant selection and genetic distance follow a nonlinear J-shaped pattern: at low levels of genetic distance, increases in genetic distance reduce the positive selection of migration. However, at higher levels of genetic distance, this pattern is reversed and migration becomes more positively selected. We complement this finding by showing that the net benefits of genetic distance are strongly decreasing for low-skilled migrants with increasing genetic distance, while high-skilled migrants are less responsive to genetic distance in general. Results are robust to conditioning on bilateral control variables, including various destination- and sending-country-specific fixed effects and applying an instrumental-variables approach that exploits exogenous variation in genetic distances in the year 1500.","Krieger, Tim & Renner, Laura & Ruhose, Jens, 2018.

Increases in the variance of their risky production process cause firms to issue assets with a higher variable payment (equity). Hikes in investors' perceived ambiguity have the opposite effect, and lead to less risk-sharing. Entrepreneurs from capital-scarce countries finance themselves relatively more through debt than equity. They are thus exposed to higher volatility per unit of consumption. The expected returns on capital invested in capital-scarce countries may also be lower. Such results do not hold in the absence of ambiguity, that is, when investors only perceive risk. New facts uncovered from cross-country firm-level data are consistent with our model.","Hill, Brian & Michalski, Tomasz, 2018.

Despite the transferred managers being comparatively few in number, they are positively associated with the growth of the affiliates' productivity.

We use a unique data set that comprises tick by tick intervention and order book data, daily capital in- and outflows, and balance sheet information of financial institutions. We apply regression discontinuity methods to identify the surprise component of rule-based interventions and use this variation to measure how they affect exchange rates and capital flows. Our findings indicate that interventions had significant effects on the exchange rate, albeit short-lived (2–3 weeks). Moreover, capital controls amplify the effect of intervention, though some effect remains even in the presence of free capital flows. A methodological contribution of the paper is to extend regression discontinuity designs to a time-series environment and to show how these techniques can be used to identify and estimate local non-linear impulse response functions. A clearly defined policy rule and high frequency data are crucial in exploiting local variation around the policy cutoff.","Kuersteiner, Guido M. & Phillips, David C. & Villamizar-Villegas, Mauricio, 2018.

Journal of International Economics,Tariffs and markups in retailing,"['Cole, Matthew T.', 'Eckel, Carsten']","Tariffs on imported products are typically expected to raise the relative price of foreign goods and, as a result, increase the residual demands of domestic substitutes. In this paper we show, more generally, that these changes in wholesale/manufacturing prices can be offset and even dominated by adjustments in retail markups. Retailers have an incentive to charge the highest markups on the lowest-cost products and to adjust the markups on these products most actively. Thus, if the procurement costs of some foreign products rise, retailers will absorb these cost increases by raising prices relatively more on their relatively more efficient products, thereby mitigating the benefits of a protectionist tariff. We show that this effect can dominate the traditional substitution effect, which highlights the need to better understand the role of retailers in trade policy.","Cole, Matthew T. & Eckel, Carsten, 2018.

Comparable elasticities for real exchange rate changes are around 0.5 on impact, and between 0.6 and 0.8 in the long run.

We exploit sector- and origin-country level import data for a panel of Chinese cities between 1997 and 2012, and differentiate between retailer and non retailer goods and across countries of origin of imports. We find that international global retail presence in Chinese cities produces a disproportionate rise in retail good imports from the retailers' country of origin. Our results point to a trade-cost reducing role of Western retailers that make it easier for foreign retail-good producers from their home country to export to China.

Journal of International Economics,Trade and fisheries subsidies,"['Bayramoglu, Basak', 'Copeland, Brian R.', 'Jacques, Jean-Francois']","Many renewable resource sectors are heavily subsidized and yet the resources are also seriously depleted. World Trade Organization members included subsidies in a key renewable resource sector (fisheries) in the Doha round of trade negotiations, which subsequently stalled. This paper develops a simple model to show why prospects for a deal on fisheries subsidies may be difficult. Typically international spillover effects create incentives among exporters to negotiate reductions in subsidies: one country's subsidy worsens other exporters' terms of trade. These incentives may not exist in fisheries for 3 reasons. First, open access fishery supply curves are backward bending and so if fisheries are depleted, subsidies raise prices (by reducing sustainable harvesting) and improve other exporters' terms of trade. Second, ecological constraints put an upper bound on sustainable harvesting. This means that subsidies that increase employment may have no effect on output and hence generate no international spillover effects if resources are well managed. And third, even if governments were compelled to reduce fishery subsidies, there may be no spillover benefits to trading partners because of policy substitution: governments would be motivated to weaken other regulations targeting the fish sector.","Bayramoglu, Basak & Copeland, Brian R. & Jacques, Jean-Francois, 2018.

We propose an analytically solvable multi-country model of endogenous selection in which dominant exporters, dominant products and dominant buyers emerge in parallel as multi-product sellers with heterogeneous technologies compete for buyers with heterogeneous needs.

Journal of International Economics,"Default risk, sectoral reallocation, and persistent recessions","['Arellano, Cristina', 'Bai, Yan', 'Mihalache, Gabriel']","Sovereign debt crises are associated with large and persistent declines in economic activity, disproportionately so for nontradable sectors. This paper documents this pattern using Spanish data and builds a two-sector, dynamic quantitative model of sovereign default with capital accumulation. Recessions are very persistent in the model and more pronounced for nontraded sectors because of default risk. An adverse domestic shock increases the likelihood of default, limits capital inflows, and thus restricts the ability of the economy to exploit investment opportunities. The economy responds by reducing investment and reallocating capital toward the traded sector to support debt service payments. The real exchange rate depreciates, a reflection of the scarcity of traded goods. We find that these mechanisms are quantitatively important for rationalizing the experience of Spain during the recent debt crisis.","Arellano, Cristina & Bai, Yan & Mihalache, Gabriel, 2018.

Journal of International Economics,Commodity booms and busts in emerging economies,"['Drechsel, Thomas', 'Tenreyro, Silvana']","Emerging economies, particularly those dependent on commodity exports, are prone to highly disruptive economic cycles. This paper proposes a small open economy model for a net commodity exporter to quantitatively study the triggers of these cycles. The economy consists of two sectors, one of which produces commodities with prices subject to exogenous international fluctuations. These fluctuations affect both the competitiveness of the economy and its borrowing terms, as higher commodity prices are associated with lower spreads between the country's borrowing rate and world interest rates. Both effects jointly result in strongly positive effects of commodity price increases on GDP, consumption, and investment, and a negative effect on the total trade balance. Furthermore, they generate excess volatility of consumption over output and a large volatility of investment. Besides explicitly incorporating a double role of commodity prices, the model structure nests the various candidate sources of shocks proposed in previous work on emerging economy business cycles. Estimating the model on Argentine data, we find that the contribution of commodity price shocks to fluctuations in post-1950 output growth is in the order of 38%. In addition, commodity prices account for around 42% and 61% of the variation in consumption and investment growth, respectively. We find transitory productivity shocks to be an important driver of output fluctuations, exceeding the contribution of shocks to the trend, which, though smaller, is not negligible.","Drechsel, Thomas & Tenreyro, Silvana, 2018.

We then document empirically, in a Panel VAR model for 50 advanced and emerging countries estimated with quarterly data from 1985 to 2012, that an increase in the leverage of US Broker-Dealers also leads to an increase in cross-border credit flows, a house price and consumption boom, a real exchange rate appreciation and a current account deterioration consistent with the transmission in the model. Finally, we study the sensitivity of the consumption and asset price response to such a shock, and show that country differences are associated with the level of the maximum loan-to-value ratio and the share of foreign currency denominated credit.","Cesa-Bianchi, Ambrogio & Ferrero, Andrea & Rebucci, Alessandro, 2018.

This paper contributes to this literature by evaluating the impact of a program that aims at enhancing competitiveness of small and medium enterprises in Brazil by providing coaching and consulting on management and production practices. Specifically, the paper tests whether the program induces treated firms to reorganize knowledge by adding more layers of different skills and competencies to their workforces. Using a unique firm-level data set, the number of layers of knowledge of the firms are compared before and after the program. The impact of the program is identified by relying on an instrumental variable approach, exploiting the quasi-experimental roll-out of its implementation, which was carried out at different times across Brazilian regions. The analysis finds that the program had an effect and that this effect is heterogeneous. The program is particularly effective in promoting the reorganization of small and medium firms.

Individuals differ with respect to their managerial ability, and choose to become entrepreneurs or workers depending on profit opportunities and labor market conditions. The model generates three groups: low-income workers facing the prospect of unemployment, middle-income entrepreneurs producing domestically, and high-income entrepreneurs offshoring some tasks abroad. Lowering financial frictions induces more individuals to become entrepreneurs, increases the masses of offshoring firms and tasks, and improves personal income and welfare distribution. It reduces unemployment when tasks are less substitutable and labor share in production is high.

Those with pro-cyclical payoffs, such as foreign currency debt, generate substantial negative pecuniary externalities because they lead to large repayments and contractionary exchange rate depreciations during financial crises. Conversely, capital flows with an insurance component, such as FDI or equity, are largely benign. We construct an externality pricing kernel and use sufficient statistics and DSGE model simulations to quantify the externalities that materialized during past financial crises. We find stark differences depending on the payoff profile, justifying taxes of up to 3% for dollar debt but close to zero for FDI. These findings contrast with the existing literature, which has suggested that policymakers should focus on reducing over-borrowing rather than changing the composition of external liabilities.","Korinek, Anton, 2018.

Transport firms need to commit to a shipping capacity sufficient for a round trip, with a possible imbalance of shipping volumes in two directions. This imbalance is known as the “backhaul problem.” As transport firms attempt to avoid this problem, a tariff in one sector may affect other independent import and/or export sectors. In particular, domestic tariffs may backfire: domestic exports may also decrease, harming domestic export sectors and the domestic economy. This finding contributes to the literature on how import liberalization may generate a positive effect on the liberalizing country's exports by identifying a new channel through endogenous changes in transport costs given the backhaul problem.","Ishikawa, Jota & Tarui, Nori, 2018.

First, we document that commodity prices exhibit strong comovement with other macro variables along the business cycle of these economies; and that a common factor accounts for most of the time series dynamics of these commodity prices. Guided by these stylized facts, we embed a commodity sector into a dynamic, stochastic, multi-country business cycle model of EMEs where exogenous fluctuations in commodity prices coexist with other driving forces. Commodity prices follow a common dynamic factor structure in the model. When estimated with EMEs data, the model gives to commodity shocks, mostly in the form of perturbations to their common factor, a paramount role when accounting for aggregate dynamics: more than a third of the variance of real output across the EMEs considered is associated to commodity price shocks. The model also performs well when accounting for other business cycle facts. A further amplification mechanism is a “spillover” effect from commodity prices to interest rates. Yet, sometimes, positive commodity price shocks have also cushioned other negative domestic shocks, particularly during the fast recovery from the world financial crisis.","Fernández, Andrés & González, Andrés & Rodríguez, Diego, 2018.

If women are less flexible, or perceived as such, exporters will exhibit a higher GWG than non-exporters. This hypothesis is examined using matched employer-employee data from the Norwegian manufacturing sector for 1996–2010. The results suggest a firm's entry into exporting increases the GWG by about 3 percentage points for college educated workers. A lower overlap in business hours between the Norwegian exporter and its foreign markets and a greater need for interactions with foreign buyers are associated with a higher GWG.","Bøler, Esther Ann & Javorcik, Beata & Ulltveit-Moe, Karen Helene, 2018.

Journal of International Economics,Input-trade liberalization and the demand for managers: Evidence from India,"['Chakraborty, Pavel', 'Raveh, Ohad']","Can input-trade liberalization increase the demand for managers? Imported inputs are an important source of technology inflows. Previous research on the implications of imported inputs overlooked their potential effect on the demand for managing the new incoming knowledge. Adopting the case of India, this paper presents a first empirical attempt to fill this gap. Using detailed firm-level data that uniquely distinguishes between the compensations of managers and non-managers, and exploiting the exogenous nature of India's Eight-Plan trade reform, we investigate the potential causal link between input-trade liberalization and the demand for managers relative to non-managers. We find that a decrease in input tariffs increases the relative demand for managers, primarily in domestic firms that use the imported inputs to produce intermediate goods. Specifically, a 10% drop in input tariffs induces, on average, a 1–1.5% increase in the compensation share of managers, manifested via increases in both their number as well as average wages and bonuses. These patterns are: (i) observed across the firms' size distribution; (ii) applicable for both exporting and non-exporting firms; (iii) stronger in family-run firms that operate under flexible labor market regulations; (iv) relatively more dominant in the short-run.

This paper demonstrates a new margin of adjustment, namely, provision of trade credit. A simple model predicts that an increase in competitive pressures will lead exporters to provide trade credit and lower prices and that the price adjustment will be attenuated by trade credit provision. These predictions are tested in the context of an exogenous shock, the end of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA), a quota system governing trade in textiles and clothing until the end-2004. The analysis focuses on Turkey which was not subject to quotas in the EU and thus faced an increase in competition after the quotas on China had been removed. The results suggest that in the post-MFA period Turkish exports of products with binding MFA quotas prior to the shock saw an increase in the provision of trade credit and a drop in prices relative to the other products.

Journal of International Economics,"International trade, income distribution and welfare","['McCalman, Phillip']","This paper studies the relationship between income distribution and international integration in a canonical trade setting with one change. In the standard model prices are solely a function of (constant) marginal costs and (constant) elasticities, implying that information on individual incomes are of no value to a firm. To allow a more realistic role for consumer level information, a firm's strategy space is expanded to include non-linear prices. Now profit maximizing firms use information on income distribution to design a product for each income class and set prices to induce each group to optimally select the appropriate option. Equilibrium involves designs below the first best for low income groups and above the first best for high income groups – welfare differences are more exaggerated than income differences. When countries with differing income distributions integrate this has implications for the size of these distortions, influencing the gains from trade both within and across countries. These implications are quantified and shown to be potentially significant factors affecting welfare outcomes from integration – with the consequences more pronounced at lower trade costs. The structure of trade and expenditure patterns that emerge also match a range of empirical findings. These results are driven by firm strategy based on income difference alone as preferences are assumed to be identical and homothetic across countries, placing the distribution of income at the center of the analysis.","McCalman, Phillip, 2018.

Journal of International Economics,Restoring the product variety and pro-competitive gains from trade with heterogeneous firms and bounded productivity,"['Feenstra, Robert C.']","The monopolistic competition model in international trade offers three sources of gains from trade beyond that of traditional comparative advantage: an endogenous expansion in product variety; a pro-competitive reduction in the markups charged by firms; and the self-selection of more efficient firms into exporting. Recent literature on trade with heterogeneous firms has emphasized the third of these effects, while the first two effects are ruled out when using a Pareto distribution for productivity with a support that is unbounded above, and no fixed costs. The goal of this paper is to restore a theoretical role for product variety and pro-competitive gains from trade by using a bounded Pareto distribution for productivity, and to demonstrate their empirical importance. For the U.S. economy over 1992–2005, we find that product variety and the reduction in markups jointly contribute about 75% to the increase in welfare resulting from trade expansion, whereas an upper bound to the selection effect is that it contributes the remaining 25% to the increase in U.S. welfare.","Feenstra, Robert C., 2018.

Using highly disaggregated firm-level data, we show that the quality upgrading made possible by China's tariff reductions was concentrated in the least productive Chinese exporters. These firms, which had been laggards in terms of quality prior to the tariff reduction, were the most aggressive in increasing the quality of their exports and their inputs and in redirecting their exports toward high income markets where demand for high quality goods is strong. Our empirical results are consistent with a simple model featuring scale effect and non-Hicks' neutral productivity that disproportionately affects the efficiency with which firms use intermediate inputs.

Innovation takes place in a rich North while firms in a poor South imitate products manufactured in North. Allowing a role for per capita incomes in determining demand delivers a complete international product cycle as described by Vernon (1966), where the different stages of the product cycle are not only determined by supply-side factors but also by the distribution of income between North and South. We analyze how changes in the gap between North and South due to changes in Southern labor productivity, population size in South and inequality across regions affect the international product cycle. In line with presented stylized facts, we predict a negative correlation between adoption time and per capita incomes.","Foellmi, Reto & Hanslin Grossmann, Sandra & Kohler, Andreas, 2018.

We first present a model featuring firms that sell goods of heterogeneous quality levels to consumers who are heterogeneous in their income and thus their marginal willingness to pay for quality increments. We derive closed-form solutions for the unique pricing game under costly international trade. The comparative statics highlight how firms' pricing-to-market decisions are shaped by the interaction of consumer income and good quality. We derive two testable predictions. First, the relative price of high qualities compared to low qualities increases with the income of the destination market. Second, the rate of cost pass-through into consumer prices falls with quality if destination market income is sufficiently high. We present evidence in support of these two predictions based on a dataset of prices, sales, and product attributes in the European car industry.","A.

I develop a model of imperfect competition where a few oligopolistic firms coexist with a monopolistically competitive fringe. The former have a direct impact on the industry average price level, which depends on the breadth of their product scope. Oligopolists produce higher output per worker, charge higher markups, but also sell at higher prices than monopolistic single-product firms. Under linear demand, trade liberalization triggers the exit of small firms and the entry of foreign large firms, leading to more product variety but also to a higher average price. For a broad class of demand functions, the entry of an oligopolist induced by trade liberalization has a negative impact on consumer surplus. Producer surplus rises, but the total effect on welfare is ambiguous.","Parenti, Mathieu, 2018.

Monetary policy could preclude a debt crisis through raising inflation and output and lowering the real interest rate. These reduce the real value of outstanding debt and the cost of new borrowing, and increase tax revenues and seigniorage.

The goal of this paper is to disentangle the supply- and demand-driven sources of this home market advantage. While trade costs, foreign production costs, and taste heterogeneity all matter for market outcomes, we find that a preference for home brands is the single most important driver of home market advantage—even after controlling for brand histories and dealer networks. Furthermore, we also find that consumers favor domestically producing brands even if these brands originated from a foreign country. Therefore, our results suggest a novel demand effect of FDI: Establishing local production increases demand for the brand even in the absence of any cost savings.","Coşar, A.

Contrary to previous literature, we explicitly take into account the interdependence of this decision with the optimal portfolio choice of internationally traded financial assets. Following financial integration, agents use equity, additional to bonds, to hedge against shocks. The resulting optimal portfolio includes a higher share of bonds denominated in foreign currency and impacts the correlation structure of costs and sales in such a way that producers move towards more local-currency pricing.

Journal of International Economics,Does higher openness cause more real exchange rate volatility?,"['Calderón, César', 'Kubota, Megumi']","Our study investigates the factors driving RER volatility and the properties of both trade and financial openness to stabilize RERs. Therefore, this paper guides us to formulate better economic policies to lower RER variability. Our goal is to test whether the extent and composition of international trade and financial integration would smooth the impact of shocks to the RER for 82 countries from 1974 to 2013. Our findings support existing theoretical models (Obstfeld and Rogoff, 1995; Hau, 2000). They confirm empirically that the composition of trade and financial openness matters for RER stabilization. We show that trade in manufacturing helps reduce RER volatility while non-manufacturing trade may contribute to higher RER volatility. Financial openness mitigates (amplifies) RER volatility in a country with higher (lower) share of foreign equity vis-à-vis foreign debt liabilities. A greater share of equity in external liabilities can improve the country's resilience to external shocks (Rogoff, 1999). Consequently, policies to lower RER volatility should account for a) the composition of financial openness as measured by the type of capital flows (i.e. equity vs. loan-related) accumulated in the domestic economy and b) the role of the structure of trade (i.e. manufacturing vs. non-manufacturing) in the transmission process of shocks to the RER. Our evidence relates to findings of mitigating effects on sudden stops of trade openness (Cavallo and Frankel, 2008), and equity- rather than debt-related financial openness (Levchenko and Mauro, 2007; Calderón and Kubota, 2013).","Calderón, César & Kubota, Megumi, 2018.

In terms of methodologies, it combines three novel features. First, it separates co-movement in monetary policies due to common shocks from spillovers of monetary policies from advanced to peripheral economies. Second, it uses revisions in growth and inflation and the Taylor rule to gauge desired changes in a country's interest rate if it is to focus exclusively on growth, inflation, and real exchange rate stability. Third, it proposes a specification that can work with the quantitative easing episodes when no changes in US interest rates are observed. In terms of empirical findings, we differ from the existing literature and document patterns of “2.5-lemma” or something between a trilemma and a dilemma: without capital controls, a flexible exchange rate regime offers some monetary policy autonomy when the center country tightens its monetary policy, yet it fails to do so when the center country lowers its interest rate. Capital controls help to insulate periphery countries from monetary policy shocks from the center country even when the latter lowers its interest rate.","Han, Xuehui & Wei, Shang-Jin, 2018.

Although capital may accumulate while labor emigrates early in the transition, the causal effect of immigration on capital investments and housing costs is positive.

Assuming a technological sequence of production stages, a recent property rights framework (Antràs and Chor, 2013; Alfaro et al., 2015) predicts that vertical integration decisions are crucially based on both the position of a supplier along the chain and on the relative size of demand elasticities faced by the final-good producer and the supplier. In line with this, we find that if final demand is sufficiently elastic (inelastic), downstream parents, i.e. final-good producers, integrate production stages that are more proximate to (far from) final demand. However, this result is not valid in the case of midstream parents, i.e. producers of intermediate inputs that can integrate either backward or forward along the chain. We document that these companies are at least as common as are downstream parents, but the existing theory neglects them. In these cases, we find that demand elasticities do not play a significant role in integration choices. Interestingly, both midstream and downstream parents tend to integrate affiliates that are more proximate in segments of a supply chain, probably due to technological complementarities in adjacent industries.","Del Prete, Davide & Rungi, Armando, 2017.

This paper proposes a novel mechanism to explain policy diversity between similar countries from an open economy perspective. I study optimal policies in a two country model where policies affect the determinants of trade patterns. Symmetric countries choose asymmetric policies in equilibrium if aggregate income is sufficiently convex in own policy. Such high social increasing return to policy, despite constant returns to scale in production, generate enough gains from trade to sustain policy diversity in equilibrium. Any asymmetric equilibrium is welfare-improving compared to the common autarky optimum. Similarly, a more asymmetric Nash equilibrium Pareto dominates a less asymmetric one. As an application, I consider a model in which the government's choice of education policy affects skill distribution and comparative advantage. In this application, the existence of an asymmetric Nash equilibrium in education policy requires that the elasticity of the education cost of agents with respect to skill is relatively low.","Chatterjee, Arpita, 2017.

Firms vary output quality across their products by using inputs of different quality levels. Their core competence is in varieties of superior quality that command higher prices but nevertheless generate higher sales. In markets where they offer fewer products, firms concentrate on their core varieties by dropping low-quality peripheral goods on the extensive margin and by shifting sales towards top-quality products on the intensive margin. The product quality ladder also governs firms' export dynamics, both in general and in response to the exogenous removal of MFA quotas on textiles and apparel.

We link this effect to the higher degree of control which parent banks hold over operations of their foreign branches compared to subsidiaries.

To analyze the effects of carbon tariffs on trade, welfare, and carbon emissions, we develop a multi-sector, multi-factor structural gravity model that allows an analytical and quantitative decomposition of the emission changes into scale, composition, and technique effects. Our analysis shows that carbon tariffs are able to reduce world emissions, mainly via altering the production composition within and across countries, hence reducing carbon leakage. This reduction comes at the cost of lower world trade flows and lower welfare, especially for developing countries. Applying our framework to investigate the effects of the emission reduction pledges made by the Annex I countries in the Copenhagen Accord, we find that combining national emission targets with carbon tariffs would increase the Accord's effectiveness by lowering the leakage rate from 13.4% to 4.1% (with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals of [11.5, 15.8] and [3.3, 4.9], respectively).","Larch, Mario & Wanner, Joschka, 2017.

Three puzzles regarding the Tokyo fixing are: (1) the spikes in prices at the fixing time occur despite a high level of liquidity in the market; (2) the order flows before the fixing are biased toward the dollar, which generates a predictable price pattern; and (3) the bank-announced fixing rates are biased toward dollar appreciation. These puzzles can be explained as a consequence of unique institutional features of the Tokyo fixing and of banks' real-side customers in Japan.","Ito, Takatoshi & Yamada, Masahiro, 2017.

However, these studies have ignored the cross-country asset pricing implications of the disaster risk model.

Given consumption pricing moments, disaster risk from this literature cannot explain the range of equity premia and government bill rates. Furthermore, the independence of disasters presumed in some studies generates counterfactually low cross-country correlations in equity markets.

When the economy has access to international borrowing and lending, a temporary commodity price boom brings about the standard wealth effect that stimulates demand and has long-run implications on the sectoral allocation of labor. If dynamic productivity gains are concentrated in the traded good sector, the commodity boom crowds out the traded sector and delays convergence to the world technology frontier. Financial openness by stimulating current demand, amplifies the crowding out effect and may even lead to a growth trap, in which no resources are allocated to the traded sector.

Only when heterogeneity is assumed Pareto-distributed do all elasticities collapse into a unique elasticity, estimable with a gravity equation. This paper provides a theory-consistent methodology for quantifying country-pair specific aggregate elasticities when moving away from Pareto, i.e. when gravity does not hold. Combining two firm-level customs datasets for which we observe French and Chinese individual sales on the same destination market over the 2000–2006 period, we are able to estimate all the components of the bilateral aggregate elasticity: i) the demand-side parameter that governs the intensive margin and ii) the supply side parameters that drive the extensive margin. These components are then used to calculate theoretical predictions of bilateral aggregate elasticities over the whole set of destinations, and how those elasticities decompose into different margins. Our predictions fit well with econometric estimates, supporting our view that micro-data is a key element in the quantification of aggregate trade elasticities.","Bas, Maria & Mayer, Thierry & Thoenig, Mathias, 2017.

We develop a theory-based measure of occupational similarity between industries and show how geographic proximity to industries using similar occupations raises the ability of an industry to respond to aggregate shocks. Using data on the employment growth of region-industry pairs in the U.S., we confirm empirically that an industry's employment responds more to nationwide changes in regions where industries have access to a relatively large pool of the occupations they need. Imputing U.S. data to our model, we show that the short-run gains from trade resulting from terms of trade movements are significantly lower than in a model where workers move freely between occupations and regions. We also find that the sensitivity of employment to economic shocks differs widely across U.S. industries, from a low sensitivity in agriculture to a high sensitivity in wholesale trade.","Curuk, Malik & Vannoorenberghe, Gonzague, 2017.

Two parties differ in their preferred size of unproductive public spending which is financed by taxes and external debt. Electoral outcomes are characterized by the economic benefits from the incumbent's policies and stochastic idiosyncratic ideological aspects. Quantitative findings suggest that endogenous political turnover increases the discrepancies between the optimal borrowing and default policies of the two parties.

Using comprehensive Chinese firm-level data, we examine the employment response to exchange rates of firms that are heterogeneous along two dimensions: external orientation and trading partner distribution. Firm-specific effective exchange rates are constructed to accurately measure exchange rate shocks pertinent to individual firms. We find that exchange rate movements induce significant labor reallocation across firms with different degrees of external orientation and with different trading partners. Trading partner distribution is as important as external orientation in explaining firms' heterogeneous employment response to exchange rates. Compared with effective exchange rate measures at more aggregate levels, using firm-specific effective exchange rates generates estimation results more consistent with theory and substantially increases the estimated impact of exchange rates on intra-industry job reallocation.","Dai, Mi & Xu, Jianwei, 2017.

For this, we decompose the price of imported capital into common and country-specific components, where the common component is the price of capital in the US. Empirically, we document that, in contrast to small industrialized countries, consumption in developing countries responds more than output to unexpected changes in the price of capital in the US. As such, fluctuations in the price of capital in the US contribute to a high volatility of consumption relative to that of output in developing countries. We then show that a small open-economy real business cycle model driven by fluctuations in the price of imported capital can account for the responses of consumption and output to innovations of the price of capital in the US and for the high relative volatility of consumption observed in developing country. Finally, confronting the model to the data, we further find that fluctuations in the price of capital in the US contribute substantially to fluctuations of consumption in countries that display a low volatility of output and a large relative volatility of consumption.","Boileau, Martin & Normandin, Michel, 2017.

As in perfect competition, a trade surplus involves an income transfer to the deficit country and possibly a terms-of-trade deterioration. Unlike the conventional wisdom, however, trade imbalances do not impose any double burden on surplus countries. This is because of a production-delocation effect, which leads to a reduction in the local price index. In the presence of intermediate goods, new results arise: A trade surplus may lead to an appreciation of the exchange rate, to a terms-of-trade improvement and even to a welfare increase. Numerical simulations show that, under realistic assumptions about preferences and technology, the beneficial price-index effect can significantly reduce the direct cost of the transfer.","Epifani, Paolo & Gancia, Gino, 2017.

When lobbies work to disrupt trade agreements, a Nash reversion punishment scheme must balance two conflicting objectives. Longer punishments help to enforce cooperation by increasing the government's costs of defecting, but, because the lobby prefers the punishment outcome, this also incentivizes lobbying effort and with it political pressure to break the agreement. Thus the model generates an optimal length for Nash reversion punishments, and it depends directly on the political influence of the lobbies.

Under a pooling equilibrium there is a wedge between the borrower's true default risk and the default risk priced in debt, and its size differs with the maturity of debt. Safe borrowers tilt their debt maturity towards short-term – relative to the optimal choice under perfect information – since long-term debt pools more default risk that is not inherent to them. Risky borrowers mimic their behavior of safe borrowers to preclude the market from identifying their type. In times of financial distress, spreads increase and the default risk wedge of long-term debt relative to short-term debt increases, which makes borrowers shorten their debt maturity.

In this paper, we examine whether protection granted to intermediate manufacturers leads to petition for protection by their downstream users. We first provide a simple model based on the quantitative framework of Ossa (2014) which identifies the key factors and their interactions that cause cascading protection to motivate our empirical analysis. Then, we test our model by identifying the input-output relationships among the time-varying temporary trade barriers of the US using its detailed input-output tables. As predicted by the theory, we find that measures on imported inputs increase the likelihood of their downstream users' subsequent trade remedy petition over the 1988–2013 period. Moreover, our simulation exercise shows that cascading protection can cause additional welfare losses, and hence we propose that trade policy investigations should take vertical linkages into account.","Erbahar, Aksel & Zi, Yuan, 2017.

We first derive the quadratic loss functions which noncooperative policy makers aim to minimize. Then, we show that noncooperative policy makers face extra trade-offs regarding stabilizing real marginal costs induced by deviations from the law of one price under local currency pricing, and that optimal monetary policy seeks to stabilize CPI inflation rates and more so under noncooperation than it does under cooperation. As a result of the increased number of stabilizing objectives, welfare gains from cooperation emerge even when two countries face only technology shocks. Still, gains from cooperation are not large, implying that frictions other than nominal rigidities are necessary to strongly recommend cooperation as an important policy framework to increase global welfare.","Fujiwara, Ippei & Wang, Jiao, 2017.

Journal of International Economics,"Comparative advantage, capital destruction, and hurricanes","['Pelli, Martino', 'Tschopp, Jeanne']","The comparative advantage of countries evolves over time, yet firms do not continuously adapt their production structure to this evolution. This slow adaptation may be due to high adjustment costs, such as those associated with the disposal of existing physical capital. In practice, these costs may explain why we observe that countries export goods at both ends of the comparative advantage spectrum. This article investigates what happens if the cost of adjusting to the dynamics of comparative advantage is unexpectedly reduced. We use hurricanes to evaluate whether a negative exogenous shock to firms' physical capital leads to a reorganization of exports towards comparative advantage industries. Using a panel of 46 countries and 4-digit industries over the period 1980–2000, we show that the effect of hurricanes on exports is monotonically increasing in comparative advantage. Specifically, export levels drop for industries with a low comparative advantage and grow for industries with a high comparative advantage. Our results also indicate that the process of shifting resources towards higher comparative advantage industries intensifies within the three years following the shock. These findings suggest that if the opportunity cost of adjustment decreases, firms tend to build back better and move up the spectrum of comparative advantage.","Pelli, Martino & Tschopp, Jeanne, 2017.

Using a small open economy model we estimate changes in the long-run level and variance of Australia's terms of trade and study the quantitative implications of these changes. An innovation of our analysis is to account in estimation for structural changes in the terms of trade. We find that long-run commodity prices increased by 35% in mid-2003 and that the volatility of shocks to commodity prices doubled soon after. The increase in the level of commodity prices is much smaller than single-equation estimates suggest.

We provide tools to characterize and quantify the effects of trade opening on the distribution of disposable income (after redistribution). We propose two adjustments to standard measures of the welfare gains from trade: a ‘welfarist’ correction inspired by the Atkinson (1970) index of inequality, and a ‘costly-redistribution’ correction capturing the efficiency costs associated with the behavioral responses of agents to trade-induced shifts across marginal tax rates. We calibrate our model to the United States over the period 1979–2007 using data on the distribution of adjusted gross income in public samples of IRS tax returns, as well as CBO information on the tax liabilities and transfers received by agents at different percentiles of the U.S. income distribution.

In this paper, we study how international equity and bond market indexes impact asset allocations, capital flows, asset prices, and exchange rates across countries. We use unique monthly micro-level data of benchmark compositions and mutual fund investments during 1996–2014. We find that movements in benchmarks appear to have important effects on equity and bond mutual fund portfolio allocations, including passive and active funds. The effects persist after controlling for time-varying industry-level factors, country-specific effects, and macroeconomic fundamentals. Changes in benchmarks not only impact asset allocations, but also capital flows, abnormal returns in aggregate stock and bond prices, and exchange rates. These systemic effects occur not just when benchmark changes are announced, but also later, when they become effective. By impacting country allocations, benchmarks explain apparently counterintuitive movements in capital flows and asset prices, as well as contagion effects.","Raddatz, Claudio & Schmukler, Sergio L. & Williams, Tomás, 2017.

In particular, the accuracy of spillover estimates obtained from bilateral models depends on two aspects of economies' integration with the rest of the world. First, accuracy worsens as direct bilateral transmission channels become less important, for example when the spillover-sender accounts only for a small share of the spillover-recipient's overall integration with the rest of the world. Second, accuracy worsens as indirect higher-order spillovers and spillbacks become more important, for example when the spillover-recipient is more integrated with the rest of the world overall. Empirical evidence on the global output spillovers from US monetary policy is consistent with these generic results: Spillover estimates obtained from two-country VAR models are systematically smaller than those obtained from a global VAR model; and the differences between spillover estimates obtained from two-country VAR models and a global VAR model are more pronounced for economies for which the US accounts for a smaller share of their overall trade and financial integration with the rest of the world, and for economies which are more integrated with the rest of the world overall.","Georgiadis, Georgios, 2017.

Estimates of structural demand and supply reveal that the merger enhanced production efficiency of the merged party by 3.8%. Simulations, based on these estimates, indicate that while the merger increased domestic prices, the export volume of the merged party was more than doubled. Moreover, the effects of the merger are found to differ by auto model according to the model's pre-merger export status. It is shown that efficiency gains from the merger are likely to increase export volumes for models that were already exported prior to the merger, and to offset domestic market power for those that were not exported even after the merger. Finally, the paper compares the actual merger's effects to those of alternative counterfactual mergers, finding that the actual merger brought greater benefits to producers and fewer to domestic consumers.","Ohashi, Hiroshi & Toyama, Yuta, 2017.

Journal of International Economics,"External balances, trade and financial conditions","['D.D.

The model is based on the present value restriction that links a country's external position to future trade flows and financial conditions in the absence of arbitrage opportunities and Ponzi schemes. It features the role played by the stochastic discount factor, the trade and valuation adjustment channels and provides a decomposition of the U.S. external position into secular and cyclical components. The model shows that shocks operating via the valuation channel are the dominant drivers of cyclical dynamics, accounting for approximately 80% of the variance over the 60-year sample. This channel works primarily via capital gains and losses on U.S. foreign assets and is closely tied to the international value of the U.S. dollar. In contrast, there is no evidence that valuation channel adjustments contribute to the secular dynamics, but differences between the average returns on foreign assets and liabilities raise the steady-state debt-to-GDP ratio from approximately 12 to 15%. The long-term deterioration in the U.S. position represents a move towards the steady-state before the early 1990s and a move away from the steady-state thereafter. I quantify the expected improvement in future U.S. trade balances needed to justify this as a sustainable path and show that they are very different from its actual behavior during the last 60years.

Using large-scale international survey data, we test whether these predicted distributional effects are reflected in the trade policy preferences of workers with different labor market skills.

Journal of International Economics,Trade policy uncertainty and exports: Evidence from China's WTO accession,"['Feng, Ling', 'Li, Zhiyuan', 'Swenson, Deborah L.']","This paper studies how reduction in trade policy uncertainty affects firm export decisions. Using a firm–product level dataset on Chinese exports to the United States and the European Union in the years surrounding China's WTO accession, we provide strong evidence that reduction in trade policy uncertainty simultaneously induced firm entries to and firm exits from export activity within fine product-level markets. In addition, we uncover accompanying changes in export product prices and quality that coincided with this reallocation: firms that provided higher quality products at lower prices entered the export market, while firms that had higher prices and provided lower quality products prior to the changes, exited. To explain the simultaneous export entries and exits, as well as the fact that new entrants are more productive than exiters, we provide a model of heterogeneous firms which incorporates trade policy uncertainty, tracing the effects of the changes in policy uncertainty on firm-level payoffs and the resulting selection effects.","Feng, Ling & Li, Zhiyuan & Swenson, Deborah L., 2017.

The macroeconomic effects of El Niño,"['Cashin, Paul', 'Mohaddes, Kamiar', 'Raissi, Mehdi']","This paper employs a dynamic multi-country framework to analyze the international macroeconomic transmission of El Niño weather shocks. This framework comprises 21 country/region-specific models, estimated over the period 1979Q2 to 2013Q1, and accounts for not only direct exposures of countries to El Niño shocks but also indirect effects through third-markets. We contribute to the climate–macroeconomy literature by exploiting exogenous variation in El Niño weather events over time, and their impact on different regions cross-sectionally, to causatively identify the effects of El Niño shocks (direct and total) on growth, inflation, energy and non-fuel commodity prices. The results show that there are considerable heterogeneities in the responses of different countries to El Niño shocks. While Australia, Chile, Indonesia, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa face a short-lived fall in economic activity in response to an El Niño shock, for other countries (including the United States and European region), an El Niño occurrence has a growth-enhancing effect. Furthermore, most countries in our sample experience short-run inflationary pressures as both energy and non-fuel commodity prices increase. Given these findings, macroeconomic policy formulation should take into consideration the likelihood and effects of El Niño weather episodes.","Cashin, Paul & Mohaddes, Kamiar & Raissi, Mehdi, 2017.

This paper shows that at the level of the products used in constructing national price levels, the relationship is present in both ‘services’ and ‘manufactures’ and the specification of the relationship is different for the two. It further offers a new candidate explanation for the B-S relationship in manufactures, which is based on an appeal to product quality. This explanation yields a second, distinctive, testable prediction: controlling for per capita income, a non-monotonic relationship should exist between a country's income inequality and its national price level. The second prediction is shown to be consistent with empirical evidence. The explanation also implies that mismeasured quality exaggerates the B-S relationship and hence the observed cross-country income differences are likely to be underestimated.","Zhang, Qi, 2017.

Theory and evidence,"['Behzadan, Nazanin', 'Chisik, Richard', 'Onder, Harun', 'Battaile, Bill']","In this paper we show that the Dutch disease can arise solely from inequality in the distribution of natural resource rents. Given two otherwise identical countries that differ only in the ownership shares of the natural resource rents, the country with the less equal distribution will have less production of manufacturing goods and less development of learning-by-doing in this sector. As opposed to conventional models, where income distribution has no effect on economic outcomes, an unequal distribution of the resource wealth can generate the Dutch disease dynamics even in countries with an initial comparative advantage in manufacturing. We also provide a range of empirical tests of our model, including both difference and system GMM estimators in a dynamic panel. To disentangle the effects of inequality and institutional quality we purge our inequality measure of any linear or higher order correlations with institutional quality and repeat our system and difference GMM estimations. Our empirical analysis supports the hypothesis that inequality indeed plays a significant role in whether being resource-rich is a blessing or a curse for a country.

We find that conditional on a level of debt, default incentives are U-shaped in the capital stock: the economy with too small or too large amounts of capital is likely to default. Even without using an ad-hoc output cost of default, the calibrated model generally well matches business cycle facts of emerging economies and generates defaults in “good” and “bad” times, with a frequency of 25.5% and 74.5%, respectively, consistent with Tomz and Wright (2007)’s empirical findings.

Yet, most existing models are not able to generate substantial transmission through international trade. We show that the nature of such transmission depends fundamentally on the features determining the responsiveness of labor supply and labor demand to international relative prices. We augment a standard international macroeconomic model to incorporate three key features: a weak short-run wealth effect on labor supply, variable capital utilization, and imported intermediate inputs for production. This model can generate large and significant endogenous transmission of technology shocks through international trade. We demonstrate this by estimating the model using data for Canada and the United States with limited-information Bayesian methods. We find that this model can account for the substantial transmission of permanent U.S. technology shocks to Canadian aggregate variables such as output and hours, documented in a structural vector autoregression. Transmission through international trade is found to explain the majority of the business cycle comovement between the United States and Canada.","Miyamoto, Wataru & Nguyen, Thuy Lan, 2017.

This paper demonstrates the importance of a key demand-side driver of education, using exogenously-driven changes in the composition of a country's exports as a lens to study how shifting patterns of production influence subsequent educational attainment. Using a panel of 102 countries and 45years, we find that growth in less skill-intensive exports depresses average educational attainment while growth in skill-intensive exports increases schooling.

The prevailing view is that anticipation of imitation reduces exporters' incentive to export goods to jurisdictions with ‘weak’ patent regimes. This empirical paper uses new measures of how the destination-country patent system can affect trade. In contrast with existing studies which assume would-be exporters can always get a patent in the target foreign market, we construct measures of the bias against foreign patent applicants and patents which may block imported goods. We find evidence that the presence of destination-country blocking patents has the larger (negative) impact on international trade.

In this paper, we use a discrete choice release gap decision game model to disentangle the impacts of the i) release gap effect, which includes factors that provide incentives for a distributor to shorten the release gap; ii) word-of-mouth effect, which provides incentives for a distributor to lengthen the release gap; and iii) competition effect, which accounts for the incentives blockbusters have to avoid each other.

To show this, we construct a two-country overlapping generations model where the North develops new goods and the South imitates these goods endogenously.

Excluding the effects of competitors' exchange rates typically biases upwards estimates of bilateral exchange rate pass-through because competitors' ERs and bilateral ERs are positively correlated. A multi-country version of Atkeson and Burstein's (2008) industry aggregation model is able to explain a sizable proportion of pass-through of competitors' exchange rates to import prices, and also predicts pass-through of foreign competitors' prices and pass-through of competitors' ERs to US producer prices — both of which are supported in the data.

Hierarchy violation is widespread: 92% of province goods have at least one non-compliant city. We show that introducing granular importers into a standard heterogeneous firm model leads to a prediction of 73% compliance, close to the observed average of 66%. Extending the model to allow buyers from a city to share an orientation towards specific source countries, we calibrate a heterogeneity parameter to match the average observed compliance rate.

We exploit these data to study the short- and long-term effects of offshoring on domestic firm-level employment, output, wages, and productivity in this large sample of offshoring events. As implied by heterogeneous firm models with high fixed costs of offshoring, we find that the average offshoring firm in the TAA sample is larger, more productive, older, and more likely to be an exporter, than the average non-offshorer. After initiating offshoring, TAA-certified offshorers experience large declines in employment (0.38 log points), output (0.33log points) and capital (0.25log points), and a concomitant increase in capital and skill intensity, relative to their industry peers. We find no significant change in average wages or productivity measures. Even six years after the initial offshoring event, we find no recovery in employment, output, or capital, and a higher probability of exit. We find similar results (including decline in output, and unchanged wages and productivity) for the aggregate of non-TAA certified plants of multi-plant offshoring firms. We find that the substitution of domestic activity by offshoring is stronger for relatively lower wage, lower capital intensity, lower productivity offshorers.

A novel feature of the study is the importance of market share on both sides of the importing relationship — that of the exporting and importing firms. We find that exchange rate pass-through and the currency of invoicing are dependent on the size (or market share) of both importers and exporters. Very small or very large exporters have higher rates of pass-through and tend to invoice in the foreign currency, while it is the opposite for exporters in the middle range. By contrast, for larger importers, pass-through is lower and local currency invoicing is more prevalent.

The cross-country co-movement in volatility of real and financial variables has increased over time with the common component becoming more important over the last decade.

This paper develops a model of trade in intermediate inputs in which heterogeneous producers face irreversibilities in adjusting their importing status. Changes in aggregate imports are accounted for by adjustment within importing plants, through reallocation between non-importers and importers, and through changes in the importing decisions of new and existing plants. When calibrated to Chilean plant-level data, the model shows that irreversibilities are important for generating aggregate and plant-level dynamics of trade flows in line with the data. In response to a permanent trade reform, increased importing at existing plants crowds out entry, raising consumption above its long-run level, and leading to welfare gains larger than a static model would imply.","Ramanarayanan, Ananth, 2017.

Applying the model to data for a diverse set of countries I find that (1) gains from trade for net exporters in sectors with low marginal product of labor are overstated in models that abstract from intersectoral distortions since in those countries trade tends to exacerbate the effect of domestic frictions; (2) the gains from implementing optimal tariffs are substantial in the presence of domestic frictions because trade policy can offset some of their negative effect; and (3), mitigating domestic frictions has a much larger potential payoff for countries when they are open to international trade","Tomasz Święcki, 2017.

The impact of globalization on the welfare of workers and aggregate output depends on the degree of substitutability between domestic workers and imported inputs. When the degree of substitutability is high (low), then globalization reduces (increases) wages and increases (reduces) unemployment. Irrespective of the substitutability, free trade doesn’t maximize the aggregate output. A small tariff (import subsidy) increases aggregate output when the substitutability is low (high), however, it can exacerbate the distributional conflict. Domestic labor market policies such as unemployment benefits and severance payments can protect workers against labor income risk but the firing restrictions do not. Free trade is optimal when labor market policies provide insurance against unemployment.","Ranjan, Priya, 2016.

While the attraction of future aid incentivizes authorities to push through reforms, these reforms in turn also make aid diversion less feasible. Further, under full commitment, the optimal aid package may involve offering scope for interim aid diversion to the elite for long-term improvement in governance, with such aid diversion being more likely to happen when the total aid budget is large. With only partial commitment (so that time consistency requires the donor to reconfigure aid in each round), it is shown that (a) interim aid diversion is no longer viable, and (b) both aid and reforms exhibit strong gradualism, or what is known as the starting small and grow later principle in commitment models.","Bag, Parimal Kanti & Roy Chowdhury, Prabal, 2016.

Our key result is that the possibility to switch partners crucially affects the contractual nature of buyer-supplier relationships. In particular, some patient firms do not immediately establish a relational contract, but only when they decide to stop searching and thus launch a long-term collaboration with their supplier.

On the one hand, exposure to global financial cycles dampens the output effect of a tightening in monetary policy in financially integrated economies and thereby reduces monetary policy effectiveness. On the other hand, another salient feature of financial globalisation is that economies have become increasingly net long in foreign currency, which amplifies monetary policy effectiveness: economies experience larger valuation losses and wealth effects on their external balance sheets in response to an exchange rate appreciation when monetary policy is tightened, hence triggering stronger output effects. We quantify empirically the net impact of financial globalisation on monetary policy effectiveness through these two opposing channels. We find that since the 1990s the second channel has dominated so that financial globalisation has amplified monetary policy effectiveness in the typical advanced and emerging market economy. By our estimates, the output effect of a tightening in monetary policy has increased by 25% due to financial globalisation. Our results imply that financial globalisation has modified the transmission of monetary policy by strengthening the importance of the exchange rate channel.","Georgiadis, Georgios & Mehl, Arnaud, 2016.

Journal of International Economics,On the different geographic characteristics of Free Trade Agreements and Customs Unions,"['Lake, James', 'Yildiz, Halis M.']","Casual observation reveals a striking phenomenon of Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs): while Customs Unions (CUs) are only intra-regional, Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) are inter and intra-regional. Using a farsighted dynamic model, we endogenize the equilibrium path of PTAs among two close countries and one far country. Rising transport costs mitigate the cost of discrimination faced by the far country as a CU non-member and diminish the value of preferential access as a CU member. Thus, sufficiently large transport costs imply that an FTA is the only type of PTA that can induce the far country's participation in PTA formation. Unlike CU formation, FTA formation can induce participation because FTAs provide a flexibility benefit: an FTA member can form further PTAs with non-members but a CU member must do so jointly with all existing members. Hence, in equilibrium, CUs are intra-regional while FTAs are intra- and inter-regional.","Lake, James & Yildiz, Halis M., 2016.

Journal of International Economics,"Tariff pass-through, firm heterogeneity and product quality","['Ludema, Rodney D.', 'Yu, Zhi']","The pass-through of tariffs to prices has critical implications for trade policy, but studies at the industry level mask potentially important firm-level heterogeneity in pass-through behavior. This paper investigates the response of U.S. export prices to changes in foreign tariffs at the firm level, accounting for firm productivity and endogenous product quality. In our model, exporting firms respond to foreign tariff reductions by upgrading product quality and increasing prices, resulting in incomplete tariff pass-through and in some cases a “quasi-Metzler paradox” (quality-unadjusted, tariff-inclusive prices increase). The upgrading response is greater for high productivity firms; however, the greater a product's scope for quality differentiation, the greater is the tendency for high productivity firms to have higher initial prices due to higher initial quality, resulting in a smaller tariff absorption elasticity (log increase in the tariff-exclusive price). Using U.S. transaction-level export data, plant-level manufacturing data, and multiple measures of scope for quality differentiation, we confirm several predictions of the theory, including an average firm-level quasi-Metzler paradox, an inverse relationship between the tariff absorption elasticity and firm productivity for products with high quality scope, and the reverse for products with low quality scope.","Ludema, Rodney D. & Yu, Zhi, 2016.

We first provide evidence that existing results relating credit expansions to economic expansions, real exchange rate appreciations and trade deficits hold more strongly for household credit than business credit. Then, using a two-sector real business cycle model of a small open economy, we study the model dynamics generated by shocks to household credit and business credit, the latter further divided into credit to tradable and nontradable sectors. The results show that the three types of credit shocks generate different dynamics in sectoral input and output levels as well as the real exchange rate. The model successfully generates the comovement between the cycle and different credit types, matching the strong positive correlation of household credit with output and real exchange rate, and the negative correlation with net exports. Our results underline the importance of distinguishing between household and business credit in studying credit dynamics.","Bahadir, Berrak & Gumus, Inci, 2016.

Journal of International Economics,Population aging and comparative advantage,"['Cai, Jie', 'Stoyanov, Andrey']","In this paper we show that demographic differences between countries are a source of comparative advantage in international trade. Since many skills are age-dependent, population aging decreases the relative supply and increases the relative price of skills which depreciate with age. Thus, industries relying on skills in which younger workers are relatively more efficient will be more productive in countries with a younger labor force and less productive in countries with an older population. Building upon the neuroscience and economics literature, we construct industry-level measures of intensities in various age-dependent skills and show that population aging leads to specialization in industries which use age-appreciating skills intensively and erodes comparative advantage in industries for which age-depreciating skills are more important.","Cai, Jie & Stoyanov, Andrey, 2016.

This heterogeneous impact is observed only when the share of preferential imports increases, leading to a decline in tariff revenue. This makes countries which tend to heavily depend on tariff revenue as a source of government funding more likely to reduce their MFN tariffs, which is also observed in the data. These results that are consistent with a mechanism operating through trade deflection and the associated loss of tariff revenue therefore lend support to the building bloc view of regionalism in countries applying high external tariffs before the agreement. In contrast, driven by other factors, the impact in low-tariff countries remains unclear with either insignificant effects or tariff substitution.","Crivelli, Pramila, 2016.

Analysis encompasses cases in which the domestic MC sector is able to expand or contract flexibly, or is constrained to be of fixed size. In the former case domestic protection can bring gains by increasing the number of product varieties on offer; these gains (and the corresponding rates of domestic subsidy or of import tariffs) are reduced by heterogeneity of foreign exporters some of whom may withdraw from the market. In the latter case gains from protection arise from terms-of-trade effects; since various margins of substitution are switched off, only the relative values of domestic taxes, import tariffs and export taxes matter. In general, policies work through both a terms-of-trade and a variety effect, and the paper shows how the relative importance of each depends on the structure of the economy.","Haaland, Jan I. & Venables, Anthony J., 2016.

The model predicts that the nominal wages of the trading countries exhibit stronger positive comovements when the countries fix their bilateral exchange rates, while comovements of real wages are not affected by exchange rate regimes. Our numerical experiments suggest that a reduction in trade costs increases both nominal and real wage comovements, regardless of regimes. When downward nominal wage rigidity is introduced, nominal wage comovements under the fixed regime remain stronger than under the flexible regime and the difference is smaller on the shorter time horizon, while a slight difference in real wage comovements between the two regimes shows up and is larger on the shorter time horizon. When we consider membership in the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union as a fixed exchange rate regime, panel regression results based on data from OECD countries are broadly consistent with our model and numerical experiments.","Kurokawa, Yoshinori & Pang, Jiaren & Tang, Yao, 2016.

We build an exporter dynamics model where firms need to pay market-specific sunk and fixed costs to operate abroad and where firm export profitability in each foreign market follows a geometric Brownian motion. Firms also differ ex ante by a constant market-specific profitability shifter. We derive the probability of export survival upon entry in a market and show that it increases with the ratio of sunk to fixed costs and is insensitive to the profitability shifters. Also, we show that the survival probability is unaffected by fixed costs if sunk costs are zero. We take the model to the data using firm-level Argentine export information. We find that survival rates decrease with distance, which the model rationalizes with sunk costs that increase with distance proportionally less than fixed costs. Estimated sunk costs are small. In fact, a counterfactual exercise shows that removing those costs increases aggregate exports by less than 1.5%. Finally, we also find that survival increases with a firm's export experience. Analogously to distance, the model's implication of this empirical result is that experience reduces sunk costs proportionally less than fixed costs.","Albornoz, Facundo & Fanelli, Sebastián & Hallak, Juan Carlos, 2016.

Journal of International Economics,The welfare impact of global migration in OECD countries,"['Aubry, Amandine', 'Burzyński, Michał', 'Docquier, Frédéric']","This paper quantifies the effect of global migration on the welfare of non-migrant OECD citizens. We develop an integrated, multi-country model that accounts for the interactions between the labor market, fiscal, and market size effects of migration, as well as for trade relations between countries. The model is calibrated to match the economic and demographic characteristics of the 34 OECD countries and the rest of the world, as well as trade flows between them in the year 2010. We show that recent migration flows have been beneficial for 69% of the non-migrant OECD population, and for 83% of non-migrant citizens of the 22 richest OECD countries. Winners are mainly residing in traditional immigration countries; their gains are substantial and are essentially due to the entry of immigrants from non-OECD countries. Although labor market and fiscal effects are non-negligible in some countries, the greatest source of gain comes from the market size effect, i.e. the change in the variety of goods available to consumers.","Aubry, Amandine & Burzyński, Michał & Docquier, Frédéric, 2016.

Journal of International Economics,Offshoring with endogenous NGO activism,"['Krautheim, Sebastian', 'Verdier, Thierry']","The process of globalization is characterized by an impressive growth of global value chains, as well as the proliferation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) interacting with multinational firms. This paper presents a model of offshoring and NGO–firm interactions in which offshoring to a low-regulation country allows a monopolist to implement a “dirty” technology undesired by consumers. Consumers can reduce the incentive for dirty production by financing an NGO monitoring the firm. NGO emergence and offshoring can arise as joint and interacting outcomes. For a range of trade costs, NGO emergence allows firms to capture gains from globalization, which would otherwise be unattainable. Somewhat paradoxically, NGO emergence can be at the expense of consumers possibly leading to welfare losses through offshoring.","Krautheim, Sebastian & Verdier, Thierry, 2016.

Journal of International Economics,Cross-border trade in electricity,"['Antweiler, Werner']","This paper develops a novel economic theory of two-way trade in a homogenous good, electricity. In this model of ‘reciprocal load smoothing,’ international trade provides insurance. As electricity demand is stochastic and correlated across jurisdictions, electric utilities can reduce their cost during peak periods by importing cheaper off-peak electricity from neighbouring jurisdictions. Two-way trade emerges in the presence of strongly convex marginal costs. Observed trade between Canadian provinces and US states strongly supports the theoretical model. Reciprocal load smoothing provides an economic rationale for integrating North America's fragmented interconnections into a continental ‘supergrid’ if technological progress in long-distance bulk transmission continues to reduce costs.","Antweiler, Werner, 2016.

Journal of International Economics,Exchange rate flexibility under the zero lower bound,"['Cook, David', 'Devereux, Michael B']","An independent monetary policy and a flexible exchange rate generally help a country in adjusting to macroeconomic shocks. But recently in many countries, interest rates have been pushed down close to the lower bound, limiting the ability of policy-makers to accommodate shocks, even with flexible exchange rates. This paper argues that when the zero bound constraint on nominal interest rates is binding and policy lacks an effective ‘forward guidance’ mechanism, a flexible exchange rate system may be inferior to a single currency area. With monetary policy constrained by the zero bound, a flexible exchange rate exacerbates the impact of shocks. Remarkably, this may hold true even if only a subset of countries are constrained by the zero bound, and other countries optimally adjust their interest rate targets. For a regime of multiple currencies to dominate a single currency in a zero bound environment, it is necessary to have effective forward guidance in monetary policy.","Cook, David & Devereux, Michael B, 2016.

Journal of International Economics,The connection between imported intermediate inputs and exports: Evidence from Chinese firms,"['Feng, Ling', 'Li, Zhiyuan', 'Swenson, Deborah L.']","We use Chinese manufacturing firm data to estimate the causal effect of increased imported intermediate input use on firm export outcomes. To account for the endogeneity of import decisions, we pursue an IV strategy that utilizes instruments for import costs connected to intermediate input import tariffs, exchange rates, and firm differences in fixed trade costs. We find that firms that expanded their intermediate input imports expanded the volume and scope of their exports. Further, we find that the benefit of imported inputs differed along a number of dimensions including initial trade status, import source country, export destination, firm ownership, and industry R&D intensity. Although increased imports of intermediates boosted exports by all firms, we find that the effects were largest when they were purchased by private firms or firms that started out as non-traders. In addition, intermediate inputs from the higher-income G7 countries were especially helpful in facilitating firm exports to the presumably more-demanding G7 export markets. Taken together, these results suggest that product upgrading facilitated by technology or quality embedded in imported inputs helped Chinese firms to increase the scale and breadth of their participation in export markets.","Feng, Ling & Li, Zhiyuan & Swenson, Deborah L., 2016.

We show that when individuals are loss averse, governments may use trade policy to shield the domestic economy from large food price shocks. This creates a complementarity between the price of food in international markets and trade policy. Specifically, unilateral actions give rise to a “multiplier effect”: when a shock drives up the price of food, exporters respond by imposing restrictions, while importers wind down protection, thus exacerbating the initial shock and soliciting further trade policy activism. We test the key prediction of the theory with a new dataset that comprises monthly information on trade measures across 77 countries and 32 food products for the period 2008–11, finding evidence of a multiplier effect in food trade policy. These findings contribute to inform the broader debate on the proper regulation of food trade policy within the multilateral trading system.","Giordani, Paolo E. & Rocha, Nadia & Ruta, Michele, 2016.

This paper develops a repeated-game model of global sourcing in which final good producers decide whether to engage with their suppliers in relational contracting and whether to integrate a supplier into a firm's boundaries or deal with the latter at arm's-length. The model predicts that the relative prevalence of vertical integration increases in the long-term orientation of the headquarters' and suppliers' managers. It further suggests that the share of a foreign subsidiary owned by a final good producer increases in the headquarters' long-term orientation. Combining industry-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Related Party Trade database with measures for long-term orientation from Hofstede et al. (2010) and the World Management Survey, I find empirical evidence supportive of the positive link between the long-term orientation of cooperation parties and the relative prevalence of vertical integration.

Consistent with the idea that trust allows firms to expand beyond a narrow circle of family members and friends, such effects are driven by an increase in average firm size, reflecting in turn a shift of the size distribution away from the smallest firms and toward the small-to-medium ones. According to our estimates, trust is no less relevant than human or physical capital, or institutions in shaping the pattern of comparative advantage.","Cingano, Federico & Pinotti, Paolo, 2016.

Firms face a sunk cost to enter the domestic market and an additional fixed cost to produce offshore. As such, the offshoring decision depends on the firm-specific productivity and on fluctuations in the relative cost of effective labor. The model generates a procyclical pattern of offshoring and dynamics along its extensive margin that are consistent with data from Mexico's maquiladora sector. The extensive margin enhances the procyclical response of the value added offshore to expansions in the home economy, as the number of offshoring firms mirrors the dynamics of firm entry at home. As a result, offshoring increases the comovement of output across economies, in line with the empirical evidence.","Zlate, Andrei, 2016.

After controlling for established predictors of high school completion, demographic shifts, and coincident labor market changes unrelated to trade with China, we estimate that a movement from the 25th to the 75th percentile in Chinese import exposure led to an average increase in the graduation rate of 3.64 percentage points. Consistent with an environment in which students weigh increases in future earnings potential from further education against current labor market opportunities foregone, we find that growth in Chinese imports led to declines in wages for all educational groups, and reductions in employment for individuals without a high school degree both in absolute terms and relative to their more educated peers.","Greenland, Andrew & Lopresti, John, 2016.

If they cannot also identify the individual producer, exporters have diminished incentives to produce high quality goods.

We contribute to this literature in three ways.

Second, we endogenize the price of any given quality. Third, we assume that firms may exercise market power. As we show, once the “small country” assumption is dropped, policies advocated in the literature such as the merger of exporters or the imposition of export quotas can have adverse consequences on the profits of domestic exporters and on the welfare of all consumers.

We examine how financial frictions affect companies' choice between processing and ordinary trade – implicitly a choice of production technology and position in global supply chains – and how this decision affects performance. We exploit matched customs and balance sheet data from China, where exports are classified as ordinary trade, import-and-assembly processing trade (processing firm sources and pays for imported inputs), and pure assembly processing trade (processing firm receives foreign inputs for free). Value added, profits, and profitability rise from pure assembly to processing with imports to ordinary trade. However, more profitable trade regimes require more working capital because they entail higher up-front costs. As a result, credit constraints induce firms to conduct more processing trade and pure assembly in particular and preclude them from pursuing higher value-added, more profitable activities. Financial market imperfections thus impact the organization of production across firms and countries and inform optimal trade and development policy in the presence of global production networks.","Manova, Kalina & Yu, Zhihong, 2016.

Their main welfare conclusion is that freer trade has an unambiguously positive static effect while the sign of the dynamic effect, stemming from the change in the growth rate of varieties, depends on the type of technology imposed for innovations. This paper revisits these conclusions. By carefully following algebraic expressions in the original work, we point at inaccuracies and explore their consequences. Our main finding is that the sign of the static effect is not always positive. Consumers may experience an immediate loss from openness if the value of the firms they own decreases due to greater import competition.

Journal of International Economics,Distribution capital and the short- and long-run import demand elasticity,"['Crucini, Mario J.', 'Davis, J. Scott']","The elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods is one of the most important parameters in international economics. The international macro literature, which is primarily concerned with short-run business cycle fluctuations, assigns a low value to this parameter. The international trade literature, which is more concerned with long-run changes in trade flows following a change in relative prices, assigns a high value to this parameter. This paper constructs a model where this discrepancy between the short- and long-run elasticities is due to frictions in distribution. Goods need to be combined with a local non-traded input, distribution capital, which is good specific. Home and foreign goods may be close substitutes, but if distribution capital is slow to adjust then agents cannot shift their consumption in the short run following a change in relative prices, and home and foreign goods appear as poor substitutes in the short run. In the long run this distribution capital can be reallocated, and agents can shift their purchases following a change in relative prices. Thus the observed substitutability gets larger as time passes.","Crucini, Mario J. & Davis, J. Scott, 2016.

We study how market structure, specifically the size of the private sector, affects tariff pass-through, and how this mechanism influenced the extent to which households benefited from the trade liberalization. Our results suggest that a higher share of private sector in Chinese cities is associated with higher levels of tariff pass-through rates. This effect works both through the distribution sector, and through the production of final goods. By incorporating the changes in consumer prices of tradable and non-tradable goods, we next investigate the impact of WTO accession on household welfare through changes in the cost of consumption. The results show that WTO accession of China was associated with welfare gains to almost every household across the per capita expenditure spectrum, and that the distributional effect is strongly pro-poor. The average welfare gain of WTO accession on Chinese households is estimated to be 7.3%. The distributional effect through higher levels of privatization was also pro-poor, indicating that privatization enhanced the pro-poor impact of trade liberalization.","Han, Jun & Liu, Runjuan & Ural Marchand, Beyza & Zhang, Junsen, 2016.

Journal of International Economics,Capital controls or macroprudential regulation?,"['Korinek, Anton', 'Sandri, Damiano']","International capital flows can create significant financial instability in emerging economies. Does this make it optimal to impose capital controls or should policymakers rely on domestic macroprudential regulation in their quest for greater financial stability? This paper shows that it is desirable to employ both instruments to mitigate contractionary exchange rate depreciations: Macroprudential regulation reduces the amount and riskiness of financial liabilities, no matter whether they are financed by domestic or foreign lenders; capital controls increase the aggregate net worth of the economy by reducing net inflows. Both types of policy measures make the economy more stable and reduce the incidence and severity of crises. They should be set higher the greater an economy's debt burden and the higher domestic inequality. In a calibration based on the East Asian crisis countries, we find that it is optimal to impose both capital controls and macroprudential regulation that amount to a 2% tax on debt flows or equivalent quantity regulations. In advanced countries where the risk of contractionary exchange rate depreciations is more limited, the role for capital controls subsides. However, macroprudential regulation remains essential to mitigate booms and busts in asset prices.","Korinek, Anton & Sandri, Damiano, 2016.

To this end, we endogenize capital accumulation within a standard model of exchange rate determination with nontraded goods. The model predicts that currencies of countries that are more “systemic” for the world economy (countries that face particularly volatile shocks or account for a large share of world GDP) appreciate when the price of traded goods in world markets is high. These currencies are better hedges against consumption risk faced by international investors because they appreciate in “bad” states of the world. As a consequence, more systemic countries face a lower cost of capital and accumulate more capital per worker. We estimate our model using data from seven industrialized countries with freely floating exchange rate regimes between 1984 and 2010 and show that cross-country variation in the stochastic properties of exchange rates accounts for 72% of the cross-country variation in capital-output ratios.

We take a unique approach by turning to direct data on market participants' information — namely, real-time firm-level earnings forecasts made by equity market analysts. The correlations of firm-level forecasts exceed those of fundamentals and are strongly related to return correlations across countries. A calibrated information-based model demonstrates that the correlation of beliefs implied by analyst forecasts leads to return correlations broadly in line with the data, both in levels and across countries — the correlation between predicted and actual is 0.63. Our findings have implications for market-wide volatility — the model-implied correlations alone can explain 44% of the cross-section of aggregate volatility.

To rationalize this pattern, we describe a model in which firms are uncertain about their profitability in a foreign market and may experiment via exports before engaging in FDI. In line with this idea, we show that the probability that a firm starts investing in a foreign country increases with its export experience in that country. In more uncertain destinations, firms delay FDI entry, experimenting longer with exports before establishing foreign affiliates.","Conconi, Paola & Sapir, André & Zanardi, Maurizio, 2016.

Once news and surprise shocks are treated as different shocks, there is no depreciation puzzle for news shocks while it is still there for surprise shocks.

Fund managers simultaneously increase allocations to other countries that have substantial exposure to China and decrease allocations to countries viewed as more likely to adjust their capital controls. Much of the effect of capital controls on portfolio allocation appears to occur through signalling — i.e., changes in investor expectations about future policies — rather than the direct cost of the controls.

Evidence from consumer boycotts,"['Heilmann, Kilian']","I estimate the impact of international conflict on bilateral trade relations using several incidents of politically motivated boycotts: The boycott of Danish goods by Muslim countries following the Muhammad Comic Crisis in 2005/2006, the Chinese boycott of Japanese goods in response to the Senkaku/Diaoyu Island conflict in 2012, the boycott of French products in the US over the Iraq War in 2003, and Turkey's boycott of Israel over the Gaza conflict in 2014. The results from difference-in-differences regressions and the synthetic control group method show that boycotts can have strong negative effects on bilateral trade in both goods and services. I estimate an average one-year trade disruption of 18.8% in the case of Denmark, 2.7% for Japan, and 1.7% for French imports, where in the latter two cases this effect is only short term. For all boycott instances, this is only a minor share of overall exports of the boycotted country over the same period. For the Iraq and Gaza conflicts, there is a reciprocal negative effect on the boycotted countries' imports from the boycotter. Product-level results are in line with intuition: Boycotts are most effective for consumer goods, especially highly-branded signature export goods such as Japanese cars, while having at most a temporary effect on intermediates and capital goods. An event study on Japanese stock market returns suggests that the Chinese boycott depressed stock values of explicitly boycotted Japanese firms only temporarily.","Heilmann, Kilian, 2016.

In a two-country model, correlated asset fire sales by banks generate systemic risk across national financial markets. Absent coordination, national regulators choose inefficiently low levels of macro-prudential regulation. Thus, symmetric countries always benefit from relinquishing their authority to a central regulator that establishes uniform regulations across countries.

Capital goods are heterogeneous in their vintage and productivity, and due to capacity constraints, only productive capital goods are activated in the equilibrium. Through this selection, the distribution of capital goods determines industry-level productivity: industry-level productivity is higher in an industry with relatively larger variation in capital goods. Hence in a perfectly competitive two-country, two-good, two-factor equilibrium, the industry has Ricardian comparative advantage. An extension of the model, which includes fixed trade cost, describes a sorting situation in which the most productive production units (which are generally newer vintage) export, the moderately productive units serve the domestic market, and the least productive units (older) do not operate.","Ishise, Hirokazu, 2016.

Journal of International Economics,Imported inputs and invoicing currency choice: Theory and evidence from UK transaction data,"['Chung, Wanyu']",A significant proportion of international trade is in intermediate goods. This paper considers theoretically and empirically how exporters' dependence on imported inputs affects their choice of invoicing currency. The model predicts that exporters that depend more on foreign currency-denominated inputs are less likely to price in their home currency. I test this and other theoretical results using a novel dataset that covers UK trade transactions with non-EU countries. I find considerable support for the model's predictions. A 10 percentage point higher share of foreign currency-denominated inputs is associated with a 20 percentage point higher probability of pricing in the same foreign currency relative to the producer's currency.,"Chung, Wanyu, 2016.

This paper re-examines this relationship using new value-added trade data for 63 advanced and emerging economies during 1995–2013. In a panel framework, we identify a significantly positive impact of bilateral (value-added) trade intensity on business cycle synchronization—controlling for global common shocks, country-pair heterogeneity and other covariates—that is absent when gross trade data are used. There is also some evidence that the impact of value-added trade on synchronization increases with the degree of (value-added) intra-industry trade.

We find robust evidence that, worldwide, industries that ship products to high-income destinations do pay higher average wages. Our IV results indicate this is a causal relationship. We also explore the operating mechanisms, and find robust evidence in support of a dual link. First, industries that ship products to high-income destination export higher quality goods (as measured by the average unit value of exports within industries). This is because high-income countries demand high-quality products. Second, the provision of quality is costly and requires more intensive use of higher-wage skilled labor. As a result, the production of higher quality products at the industry level creates a wage premium and conduces to higher average industry wages.","Brambilla, Irene & Porto, Guido G., 2016.

Using U.S. import price micro data, we identify two facts: First, exactly the firms that react the most with their prices to changes in their own costs are also the ones that react the least to changing prices of competing importers. Second, the response of import prices to exchange rate changes is U-shaped in our proxy for market share while it is hump-shaped in response to the prices of competing importers. We show that both facts are consistent with a model based on Dornbusch (1987) that generates variable markups through a nested-CES demand system. Finally, based on the model, we find that direct cost pass-through and price complementarities among importers play approximately equally important roles in determining pass-through but also partly offset each other. This suggests that equilibrium feedback effects in import pricing are large. Omission of either channel in an empirical analysis results in a failure to explain how market structure affects price-setting in industry equilibrium.","Auer, Raphael A. & Schoenle, Raphael S., 2016.

We find that global macro and micro shocks are always associated with a slower response of prices than the respective local shocks.

We compare acquisitions undertaken during financial crises – so called fire-sale FDI – with acquisitions made during non-crisis periods to examine whether the outcomes differ in the ways predicted by the model. Foreign acquisitions are driven by two sources of value creation. First, acquisitions by a foreign firm relax the target's credit constraint (i.e., a liquidity motive). Second, acquisitions exploit operational synergies between the target and the acquirer (i.e., a synergistic motive). During crises credit conditions tighten in the target economy and the liquidity motive dominates. The model predicts that during crisis relative to non-crisis periods, (1) the likelihood of foreign acquisitions is higher; (2) the proportion of foreign acquisitions in the same industry is lower; (3) the average size of ownership stakes is lower; and (4) the duration of acquisitions is lower (i.e., acquisition stakes are more likely to be flipped). We find support for (1) but not for the other three predictions. The results thus suggest that foreign acquisitions in emerging markets do not differ in these important ways between crisis and normal periods.","Alquist, Ron & Mukherjee, Rahul & Tesar, Linda, 2016.

My model preserves much of the tractability of standard aggregate quantitative trade models while allowing for the effects of any pattern of comparative advantage, across many products and countries, to be taken into account. After fitting my model to product-level trade data, I find that the composition of trade flows is quantitatively important in determining the welfare gains from trade and the aggregate effects of trade barriers. A key finding is that the welfare gains from trade tend to be larger and more skewed in favor of low-income countries than an aggregate model would suggest.","French, Scott, 2016.

In particular, the negative income shock in partner countries affected exports of goods but not exports of services. This difference is economically sizable: if goods exports had had the same elasticity to GDP growth as services exports, their fall during the 2008–2009 collapse would have been only half what was observed.","Ariu, Andrea, 2016.

The substantial variation we document across trading firms, in terms of the duration of time and the intensity with which they trade, the number and type of products they trade, and in terms of the number and characteristics of their trading partners, plays an integral role in explaining the robust association between trading and employment volatility.

The volatility of LOP deviations is found to be increasing both on the distance separating two locations and on the degree of price stickiness. Sticky prices are also found to be systematically related to the persistence of LOP deviations: Half-lives of LOP deviations are systematically larger for goods with stickier prices. These observations are shown to accord well with the predictions of a dynamic general equilibrium model featuring real market segmentation and Calvo pricing.

To estimate how these shocks transmit across borders, we use data on cross-country bank exposures to sovereign debt. Our results indicate that cross-border financial exposures constitute important transmission channels: a reduction of exposure to overall Greek debt by one standard deviation is associated with a reduction in the response of the sovereign CDS to a shock to Greek sovereign risk by about three quarter in the average country. Decomposing these effects, we find that exposures to sovereign debt constitute significant transmission channels, while we find no robust support for transmission through bank-to-bank lending.","Brutti, Filippo & Sauré, Philip, 2015.

Journal of International Economics,Imperfect mobility of labor across sectors: a reappraisal of the Balassa–Samuelson effect,"['Cardi, Olivier', 'Restout, Romain']","This paper investigates the relative price and relative wage effects of a higher productivity in the traded sector compared with the non traded sector in a two-sector open economy model with imperfect substitutability in hours worked across sectors. The Balassa–Samuelson (1964) model predicts that a rise in the sectoral productivity ratio by 1% raises the relative price of non tradables by 1% while leaving the non traded wage-traded wage ratio unchanged. Applying cointegration methods to a panel of fourteen OECD countries over the period 1970–2007, our estimates show that the relative price rises by only 0.78% and the relative wage falls by 0.27%. While our first set of empirical findings cast doubt on the quantitative predictions of the Balassa–Samuelson model, our second set of evidence highlights the role of imperfect labor mobility: the relative price responds more to a productivity differential between tradables and non tradables while the reaction of the relative wage is more muted in countries with higher intersectoral reallocation of labor. We show that the ability of the two-sector model to account for our evidence quantitatively relies upon two ingredients: i) imperfect mobility of labor across sectors, and ii) physical capital accumulation. Finally, our numerical results reveal that the model predicts the relative price response fairly well, and to a lesser extent the relative wage response.","Cardi, Olivier & Restout, Romain, 2015.

Journal of International Economics,Trade policy and wage inequality: A structural analysis with occupational and sectoral mobility,"['Artuç, Erhan', 'McLaren, John']","A number of authors have argued that a worker's occupation of employment is at least as important as the worker's industry of employment in determining whether the worker will be hurt or helped by international trade. We investigate the role of occupational mobility on the effects of trade shocks on wage inequality in a dynamic, structural econometric model of worker adjustment. Each worker in our specification can switch either industry, occupation, or both, paying a time-varying cost to do so in a rational-expectations optimizing environment. We also specify a novel model of offshoring based on task-by-task comparative advantage that collapses to a very simple form for simulation. We find that the costs of switching industry and occupation are both high, and of similar magnitude. In simulations we find that a worker's industry of employment is much more important than either the worker's occupation or skill class in determining whether or not she is harmed by a trade shock, but occupation is crucial in determining who is harmed by an offshoring shock.","Artuç, Erhan & McLaren, John, 2015.

This paper explores qualitatively and quantitatively how this distinction matters for the gains from trade. Most obviously, tariffs generate government revenues, while icebergs do not. In models of monopolistic competition, they may also affect entry. Finally, depending on whether they are modeled as cost or demand shifters, tariffs may have different implications on profits, entry, and, in turn, on the elasticity of trade flows and welfare. We show that the welfare formula by Arkolakis, Costinot, and Rodriguez-Clare (2012) requires qualification, even in the simple single-sector case.

Evidence from Tunisia,"['Cadot, Olivier', 'Fernandes, Ana M.', 'Gourdon, Julien', 'Mattoo, Aaditya']","This paper evaluates the effects of the FAMEX export promotion program in Tunisia on the performance of beneficiary firms. While most studies assess only the short-term impact of such programs, we consider also the longer-term impact. Our estimates suggest that the average beneficiary initially saw both higher overall export levels and greater diversification across destinations and products. However, three years after the intervention, beneficiaries' export levels and diversification were no longer significantly different from those of a control group. Furthermore, the effects were heterogeneous across firms: small and large firms saw no positive impact on export levels, and even the positive impact on medium sized firms was temporary. The temporariness of the impact was not due to spillovers to non-beneficiary firms which helped them to catch up, or to greater exposure of beneficiaries to crisis-affected economies. Rather, the impact may be transient because the program did not lead to the enhancements in product quality or sophistication which could have strengthened competitiveness durably. Notwithstanding its transient effect, the relatively low-cost FAMEX still generated two Tunisian Dinars of private profits per Dinar of program expenditure, and the additional corporate tax revenue just covered the public cost of the program.","Cadot, Olivier & Fernandes, Ana M. & Gourdon, Julien & Mattoo, Aaditya, 2015.

After controlling for the acquisition effect that exists in domestic acquisitions, we find no evidence that foreign ownership can bring additional productivity gains to target firms, though both foreign and domestic acquisitions bring productivity improvements to target firms. In contrast, a strong and robust finding is that foreign ownership significantly improves target firms' financial conditions and exports relative to domestic-acquired firms.

When trade is liberalized, some multinationals find it more profitable to export and forgo the costs of maintaining capacities in foreign markets. I examine how this trade-off can have long-run effects on growth and welfare. The model emphasizes the importance of firms' ability to access multiple markets in providing incentives to innovate and highlights the role of the quality of technology in international technology spillovers for promoting growth. I find that by shutting down openness to both trade and multinational production with other OECD countries, the US would experience a welfare cost that is equivalent to a 39% drop in consumption, with the dynamic effect accounting for at least 40% of the estimated welfare cost. Since multinationals tend to use relatively high quality technology, trade liberalization alone can lead to an adverse effect on economic growth and consumer welfare by reducing the level of multinational production.","Wu, Tommy T., 2015.

Our theory predicts that the scope for trade widens and international specialisation intensifies as incomes grow and wealthier consumers raise the quality of their consumption baskets. This implies that comparative advantages strengthen gradually over the path of development as a by-product of the process of quality upgrading. The evolution of comparative advantages leads to specific trade patterns that change over the growth path, by linking richer importers to more specialised exporters. We provide empirical support for this prediction, showing that the share of imports originating from exporters exhibiting a comparative advantage in a specific product correlates positively with the importer's GDP per head.","Jaimovich, Esteban & Merella, Vincenzo, 2015.

The new channel arises in a standard dynamic Heckscher–Ohlin model composed of small-open economies that take international output prices as given. Within this framework, a more capital-intensive primary sector implies that natural-resource abundant economies grow more slowly along the adjustment path. This effect might be only temporary because the natural input also affects long-run income, and not necessarily in the same direction as transitional growth.

A dataset of 18 industrial countries is used for the analysis. Panel VAR models are estimated for the groups of countries classified by country characteristics. The primary empirical findings are as follows. First, positive government consumption shocks lead, if anything, to real exchange rate depreciation, but the direction of the current account response varies across samples. In particular, positive government consumption shocks lead to real exchange rate depreciation under a floating exchange rate regime. Second, international capital mobility has a significant impact on the effects of government consumption shocks. The depreciation of the real exchange rate and the improvement of current account are larger in countries with low international capital mobility than those with high capital mobility. Third, albeit less robust, the depreciation of the real exchange rate and the improvement of the current account are larger in countries under more flexible exchange rate regimes than those under less flexible exchange rate regimes. In addition, the current account improves more in countries with high trade openness than those with low trade openness. Standard theories do not fully explain these empirical patterns.

We also show that while the enlargement of the monetary union to another group of small open economies can bring about welfare gains for all countries involved, monetary integration of two large economies, such as the euro area and the U.S., will not.

By using specific trade concerns to capture the restrictiveness of product standards, we focus only on standards that are perceived as trade barriers. We analyze their effects on three trade-related outcomes: (i) the probability to export and to exit the export market (the firm-product extensive margin), (ii) the value exported (the firm-product intensive margin), and (iii) export prices. We find that SPS concerns discourage the presence of exporters in SPS-imposing foreign markets. We also find a negative effect of SPS imposition on the intensive margins of trade.

Different approaches to estimate the gravity equation, i.e. reduced-form or more structural, have been proposed. This paper examines the role of adding-up constraints as the key difference between structural gravity with “multilateral resistance” indexes and reduced-form gravity with simple fixed effects by exporter and importer. In particular, estimating gravity equations using the Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimator (Poisson PML) with fixed effects automatically satisfies these constraints and is consistent with the introduction of “multilateral resistance” indexes as in Anderson and van Wincoop (2003).","Fally, Thibault, 2015.

The majority of the recent significant contributions on the matter assumes that trade is log-linear in exporter-specific factors, importer-specific factors, and log trade costs that are additively composed of a parameterized part and a residual part. We demonstrate that, under standard assumptions in the literature, the magnitude of unobservable, residual trade costs is large, and that their ignorance leads to a bias of the importance of observable trade-cost measures as well as of country-specific variables that are either solved implicitly through structural estimation or estimated explicitly as fixed effects. The reason is that, due to general-equilibrium linkages, some country-specific variables are endogenous to residual trade costs, regardless of whether they are captured by iteratively-solved structural terms or by country(-time) fixed effects. As a result, quantifications of effects of trade costs and comparative static results are also biased. Apart from diagnosing this problem, the paper provides remedies for it by proposing theory-consistent approaches including a two-step procedure that permits identifying partial effects of observable gravity variables on total trade costs and trade flows which do not suffer from the unobserved-trade-cost bias.","Egger, Peter H. & Nigai, Sergey, 2015.

Journal of International Economics,Trade dynamics with sector-specific human capital,"['Guren, Adam', 'Hémous, David', 'Olsen, Morten']","This paper develops a dynamic Heckscher Ohlin Samuelson model with sector-specific human capital and overlapping generations to characterize the dynamics and welfare implications of gradual labor market adjustment to trade. Our model is tractable enough to yield sharp analytic results, that complement and clarify an emerging empirical literature on labor market adjustment to trade. Existing generations that have accumulated specific human capital in one sector can switch sectors when the economy is hit by a trade shock. Nonetheless, the shock induces few workers to switch, generating a protracted adjustment that operates largely through the entry of new generations. This results in wages being tied to the sector of employment in the short-run but to the skill type in the long-run.

We find that the RMB price response to exchange rate changes is very small, indicating relatively high exchange rate pass-through into foreign currency denominated prices, while the volume response is moderate and significant. Furthermore, exporters with higher productivity price more to market, though the pass-through is still very high. Other sources of heterogeneity, such as import intensity, distribution costs, income level of the destination countries, and foreign ownership also matter. Moreover, RMB appreciation reduces the probability of entry as well as the probability of continuing in the export market.","Li, Hongbin & Ma, Hong & Xu, Yuan, 2015.

Accordingly, the responses of bilateral US dollar exchange rates to interest rate shocks should differ substantially with respect to the (US or foreign) origin of the shock. We demonstrate this empirically and apply a model of liquidity premia on US treasuries originating from monetary policy implementation. The liquidity premium leads to a modification of uncovered interest rate parity (UIP), which enables the model to explain an appreciation of the dollar subsequent to an increase in US interest rates if foreign interest rates follow the US monetary policy rate.","Linnemann, Ludger & Schabert, Andreas, 2015.

We introduce these two features in a New Keynesian model and revisit the effects of fiscal consolidations.

In the model, spending cuts induce a reallocation of production towards the formal sector, thus reducing tax evasion. Tax hikes increase the incentives to produce in the less productive shadow sector, implying higher output and unemployment losses. Corruption further amplifies these losses by requiring larger hikes in taxes to reduce debt. We use the model to assess the recent fiscal consolidation plans in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Our results corroborate the evidence of increasing levels of tax evasion during these consolidations and point to significant output and welfare losses, which could be reduced substantially by combating tax evasion and corruption.","Pappa, Evi & Sajedi, Rana & Vella, Eugenia, 2015.

Assessing their effectiveness is complicated by selection bias; countries which change their capital-flow management measures (CFMs) often share specific characteristics and are responding to changes in variables that the CFMs are intended to influence. This paper addresses these challenges by using a propensity-score matching methodology. We also create a new database with detailed information on weekly changes in controls on capital inflows, capital outflows, and macroprudential measures related to international transactions from 2009 to 2011 for 60 countries. Results show that these macroprudential measures can significantly reduce some measures of financial fragility. Most CFMs do not significantly affect other key targets, however, such as exchange rates, capital flows, interest-rate differentials, inflation, equity indices, and different volatilities. One exception is that removing controls on capital outflows may reduce real exchange rate appreciation. Therefore, certain CFMs can be effective in accomplishing specific goals—but most popular measures are not “good for” accomplishing their stated aims.","Forbes, Kristin & Fratzscher, Marcel & Straub, Roland, 2015.

Journal of International Economics,Banking across borders,"['Niepmann, Friederike']","The international linkages between banks play a crucial role in today's global economy. Existing models explain these links largely on the basis of portfolio theory, in which banks diversify lending. These models have found limited empirical support and do not speak to several relevant dimensions of the data. They do not explain heterogeneity in the degree to which banks operate through foreign affiliates, fund their activities abroad or matter for local lending in foreign countries. This paper proposes a complementary theory of banking across borders that is based on elements of international trade theory. In the model, banking across borders arises because countries differ in their relative factor endowments and in the efficiency of their banking sectors. Based on these differences, the pattern of foreign bank asset and liability holdings emerges endogenously. This parsimonious model provides a rationale for the observed heterogeneity in foreign bank activities and is consistent with key patterns in the data.","Niepmann, Friederike, 2015.

Yet, traditional international business cycle models predict a much weaker link between trade and business cycle comovement. We propose that fluctuations in the number of varieties embedded in trade flows may drive the observed comovement by increasing the correlation among trading partners' aggregate productivity. Our hypothesis is that business cycles should be more strongly correlated between countries that trade a wider variety of goods. We find empirical support for this hypothesis. After decomposing trade into its extensive and intensive margins, we find that the extensive margin explains most of the trade–productivity and trade–output comovement. This result is striking because the extensive margin accounts for only a fourth of the variability in total trade. We then develop a two-country model with heterogeneous firms, endogenous entry, and fixed export costs, in which the aggregate productivity correlation increases with trade in varieties. A numerical exercise shows that our proposed mechanism increases business cycle synchronization compared with the levels predicted by traditional models.","Liao, Wei & Santacreu, Ana Maria, 2015.

Journal of International Economics,"Institutions, Corporate Governance and Capital Flows","['Mukherjee, Rahul']","Countries with weaker domestic investor protection hold less diversified international portfolios. An equilibrium business cycle model of North-South capital flow with corporate governance frictions between outside investors and corporate insiders explains this phenomenon through two channels. First, weak governance leads to concentrated ownership in the South because international diversification by insiders is penalized by lower stock market valuation. This reduces the float portfolio, or the supply of South assets. Second, weak governance tilts the demand of South outside investors towards domestic assets to hedge labor income risk. This is due to a higher share of labor in income, which increases labor income risk. In addition, the dynamics of investment under insider control leads relative dividend and labor income to be more negatively correlated in the South, making domestic assets a better hedge against local labor income risk. I find that the insider ownership and hedging channels are responsible for at least 29% and 11%, respectively, of the cross-country variation in international diversification. Thus, weak institutions lower international diversification primarily through concentrated ownership of firms, with outsider hedging also playing a quantitatively significant role.","Mukherjee, Rahul, 2015.

We find that increasing domestic inflation reduces domestic R&D investment and the growth rate of domestic technology. Given that economic growth in a country depends on both domestic and foreign technologies, increasing foreign inflation also affects the domestic economy. When each government conducts its monetary policy unilaterally to maximize the welfare of domestic households, the Nash-equilibrium inflation rates are generally higher than the optimal inflation rates chosen by cooperative governments who maximize the welfare of both domestic and foreign households. Under the CIA constraint on R&D (consumption), a larger market power of firms amplifies (mitigates) this inflationary bias. We use cross-country panel data to estimate the effects of inflation on R&D and also calibrate the two-country model to data in the Euro Area and the US to quantify the welfare effects of decreasing the inflation rates from the Nash equilibrium to the optimal level.","Chu, Angus C. & Cozzi, Guido & Lai, Ching-Chong & Liao, Chih-Hsing, 2015.

Journal of International Economics,Optimal monetary policy in a currency union with interest rate spreads,"['Bhattarai, Saroj', 'Lee, Jae Won', 'Park, Woong Yong']","We introduce “financial imperfections” – asymmetric net wealth positions, incomplete risk-sharing, and interest rate spreads across member countries – in a prototypical two-country currency union model and study implications for monetary policy transmission mechanism and optimal policy. In addition to, and independent from, the standard transmission mechanism associated with nominal rigidities, financial imperfections introduce a wealth redistribution role for monetary policy. Moreover, the two mechanisms reinforce each other and amplify the effects of monetary policy. On the normative side, financial imperfections, via interactions with nominal rigidities, generate two novel policy trade-offs. First, the central bank needs to pay attention to distributional efficiency in addition to macroeconomic (and price level) stability, which implies that a strict inflation targeting policy of setting union-wide inflation to zero is never optimal. Second, the interactions lead to a trade-off in stabilizing relative consumption versus the relative price gap (the deviation of relative prices from their efficient level) across countries, which implies that the central bank allows for less flexibility in relative prices. Finally, we consider how the central bank should respond to a financial shock that causes an increase in the interest rate spread. Under optimal policy, the central bank strongly decreases the deposit rate, which reduces aggregate and distributional inefficiencies by mitigating the drop in output and inflation and the rise in relative consumption and prices. Such a policy response can be well approximated by a spread-adjusted Taylor rule as it helps the real interest rate track the efficient rate of interest.","Bhattarai, Saroj & Lee, Jae Won & Park, Woong Yong, 2015.

Throughout the history of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, qualitative evidence of various sources of distortion abounds. No study, however, has quantified the inefficiency in the slave trade due to these distortions. We use a structural approach to identify the dispersion of distortions in the slave trade from wedges in first order conditions. We then calculate the TFP gains had the dispersion of distortions disappeared. Two main results emerge. First, dispersion of distortions had the smallest damage to TFP in Great Britain, followed by Portugal, and then France. Second, dispersion of distortions in the product market had a bigger impact on TFP than that of the capital and labor markets.","Dalton, John T. & Leung, Tin Cheuk, 2015.

In the model, firms differ in their ability to monitor workers who have an incentive to shirk. As high quality output requires high worker effort, it is firms with better monitoring ability that upgrade their quality. Indeed, these firms upgrade their quality to such a degree that they also end up paying higher wages to induce even more worker effort. Trade liberalization can induce greater or smaller wage inequality but always enlarges the welfare inequality as higher wages go hand in hand with even greater effort.","Wang, Yongjin & Zhao, Laixun, 2015.

We test whether this was true in the first wave of globalization by constructing market potential measures for a sample of 27 countries in 1900 and 1910 based on a general equilibrium model of production and trade. Cross-sectional estimates suggest that market potential was an economically significant determinant of GDP per capita at this time. To assess welfare effects, we then study the general equilibrium impact of raising market potential by eliminating international borders in a quantitative counterfactual calculation for 1900. There are significant gains in real income per capita for all nations. We use US per capita output as a benchmark, since it attained leadership in this variable from the late 19th century and the literature frequently attributes this to its relatively large domestic market – a market unconstrained by trade costs associated with international borders. Because market potential was already near that of the US, the largest European countries do not entirely close their per capita income gaps with the US after removing all border barriers to trade within Europe or even globally. On the other hand, many small European countries could have done so.","Liu, Dan & Meissner, Christopher M., 2015.

Using firm-level data on multinationals located in France, we show that firms are more likely to outsource the production of intermediate inputs to external suppliers when importing from countries with high worker bargaining power. This effect is stronger for firms operating in capital-intensive and differentiated industries. We propose a theoretical mechanism that rationalizes these findings. The fragmentation of the value chain weakens the workers' bargaining position, by limiting the amount of revenues that are subject to union extraction. The outsourcing strategy reduces the share of surplus that is appropriated by the union, which enhances the firm's incentives to invest. Since investment creates relatively more value in capital-intensive industries, increases in worker bargaining power are more likely to be conducive to outsourcing in those industries. Overall, our findings suggest that global firms choose their organizational structure strategically when sourcing intermediate inputs from markets where worker bargaining power is high.","Carluccio, Juan & Bas, Maria, 2015.

Integration of banking across localities reduces the degree of local monopoly power of financial intermediaries. The economy that implements this form of deregulation experiences increased producer entry, real exchange rate appreciation, and a current account deficit. The foreign economy experiences a long-run increase in GDP and consumption. Less monopoly power in financial intermediation results in less volatile business creation, reduced markup countercyclicality, and weaker substitution effects in labor supply in response to productivity shocks. Bank market integration thus contributes to moderation of firm-level and aggregate output volatility. In turn, trade and financial ties allow also the foreign economy to enjoy lower GDP volatility in most scenarios we consider.

This paper explains this behavior with a model of demand learning in which an exporter's profitability on the demand side is determined by a time-invariant firm–destination appeal index, and transient firm–destination–year preference shocks. New exporters must learn about their appeal indices in the presence of these shocks, and respond to fluctuations in demand by adding and dropping products more frequently than older exporters because they have less information about their attractiveness to consumers. Calibrated to match cross-sectional and dynamic moments of the distribution of sales and scope, the model quantitatively accounts for two thirds of the extent of product switching. The model further predicts that in response to a decline in trade costs, existing exporters add new products and new exporters enter a destination.

In a LQE, only the lowest-quality and the highest-quality firms are active; a range of relatively high-quality firms are permanently kept out of the market by the informational friction. Countries with bad quality reputation can therefore be locked into exporting low-quality, low-cost goods. Our model delivers novel insights about the dynamic impact of trade policies. First, an export subsidy increases the steady-state average quality of exports and welfare in a LQE, but decreases both quality and welfare in a HQE. Second, there is a tax/subsidy scheme based on the duration of export experience that replicates the perfect information outcome. Third, a minimum quality standard can help an economy initially in a LQE moving to a HQE.","Cagé, Julia & Rouzet, Dorothée, 2015.

Lowering trade costs between two countries reduces probability of an armed conflict between them, causing both to cut defense spending. This in turn causes a domino effect on defense spending by other countries. As a result, both countries and the rest of the world are better off. We estimate the model using data on trade, conflicts, and military spending.

Journal of International Economics,Logistic infrastructure and the international location of fragmented production,"['Blyde, Juan', 'Molina, Danielken']","Casual evidence suggests that multinational companies increasingly look for places with adequate transport and logistic infrastructure to locate affiliates that participate in cross-border production sharing. Yet, there are no systematic empirical analyses examining how logistic infrastructure interacts with the location decisions made by multinationals. Most studies on the determinants of FDI address the issue of transportation-logistics by examining the impact of distance on the relevant outcome, but distance does not capture by itself the quality of the logistic systems in place. We overcome this shortcoming in the literature by embedding indicators of infrastructure into an empirical framework that examines whether countries with adequate logistic systems attract more vertical FDI and particularly in industries that are more dependent on logistic services. We find that logistic infrastructure positively impacts vertical FDI in addition to the impact typically found on distance. A change from the first quartile to the third quartile of the distribution of logistic infrastructure is associated with an average increase in the number of vertically-integrated subsidiaries equivalent to 29%.","Blyde, Juan & Molina, Danielken, 2015.

I construct a unique dataset containing firm-level trade transaction data, balance sheets and credit scores from an independent credit insurance company for Belgian manufacturing firms between 1999 and 2007. Firms are more likely to be exporting or importing if they enjoy lower credit constraints. Also, firms that have better credit rating export and import more. Importing and exporting behaviors differ in how both the level and growth of the various margins of trade are related to credit constraints in one important dimension.

Guided by firm interviews that suggested substantial heterogeneity across firms in how they responded to Walmart's entry, we develop a dynamic industry model in which firms decide whether to sell their products through Walmex (short for Walmart de Mexico), or use traditional retailers. Walmex provides access to a larger market, but it puts continuous pressure on its suppliers to improve their product's appeal, and it forces them to accept relatively low prices relative to product appeal. Simulations of the model show that the arrival of Walmex separates potential suppliers into two groups. Those with relatively high-appeal products choose Walmex as their retailer, whereas those with lower appeal products do not. For the industry as a whole, the model predicts that the associated market share reallocations, adjustments in innovative effort, and exit patterns increase productivity and the rate of innovation. These predictions accord well with the results from our firm interviews. The model's predictions are also supported by establishment-level panel data that characterize Mexican producers' domestic sales, investments, and productivity gains in states with differing levels of Walmex presence during the years 1994 to 2002.","Iacovone, Leonardo & Javorcik, Beata & Keller, Wolfgang & Tybout, James, 2015.

Based on this observation, I argue that the recent growth of world trade is best understood from a factor-proportions perspective. Using data on trade barriers and estimates of capital–labour ratios for a group of 45 economies between 1980 and 2008, I find that a calibrated factor-proportions model can generate significant trade growth during this period, amounting to 90% of the observed rise in North–South trade. The opening up of China alone accounts for three quarters of the predicted increase. In line with the model, I present evidence that China's liberalisation has raised the exports and imports of capital-abundant countries relative to more labour-abundant economies. Overall, my findings suggest that factor-proportions theory may be useful for interpreting several quantitative and qualitative aspects of growing world trade in a period during which the group of large, open economies has become significantly less homogenous.","Zymek, Robert, 2015.

Journal of International Economics,An OLG model of global imbalances,"['Eugeni, Sara']","In this paper, we investigate the relationship between East Asian countries' high propensity to save and global imbalances in a two-country OLG model with production. The saving behavior of emerging economies and capital outflows to the United States can be attributed to their poor pay-as-you-go systems. The model predicts that emerging countries run a trade surplus only as long as the long-run growth rate of the economy is higher than the real interest rate (capital overaccumulation case). The low real interest rate in the US is therefore evidence in favor of the hypothesis that there is a “global saving glut” in the world economy. The model can explain why the US current account deteriorated gradually and only in the late 1990s, although the net foreign asset position had already turned negative in the early 1980s. Finally, the analysis also implies that an improvement of the pay-as-you-go system in China would have the effect of reducing the imbalances. In accordance with the theory, we find that the higher is the percentage of the working population covered by the pay-as-you-go system the lower are savings and the current account balance in a cross-section of countries.","Eugeni, Sara, 2015.

Different trade regimes imply different costs of such disputes in terms of arming. Depending on world prices, free trade can intensify arming to such an extent that the additional security costs it brings swamp the traditional gains from trade and thus render autarky more desirable for one or all rival states. Free trade, though, is always an equilibrium, and sometimes is a dominant one with features of a prisoner's dilemma outcome. Furthermore, contestation of resources can reverse a country's apparent comparative advantage relative to its comparative advantage in the absence of conflict. And, where such conflict is present, comparisons of autarkic prices to world prices could be inaccurate predictors of trade patterns.","Garfinkel, Michelle R. & Skaperdas, Stergios & Syropoulos, Constantinos, 2015.

Two effects from financial integration emerge: diversification effects and financial terms of trade effects. Results show that financial integration between the center and a new periphery in center-periphery integration generates welfare losses for the peripheral country already integrated and welfare gains for the central country.

These countries imposed import quotas on textile and apparel products until 2005 and experienced a subsequent increase in imports of previously constrained Chinese firms. Controlling for firm-destination specific effects and accounting for potential true state dependence we show that the probability to export to a country increases by about two percentage points for each prior export destination which shares a common border with this country.

We calibrate the model to match both cross-sectional and dynamic aspects of US producers related to export participation and the establishment lifecycle. We find a tariff equivalent of fixed export costs of 30 percentage points. We also find that a sizeable share of export profits is a return to the organizational capital from investing in export capacity rather than creating an establishment. We use the model to estimate the effect of reducing tariffs on welfare, trade, and export participation. We find that eliminating an 8 percent tariff increases the ratio of trade to GDP from 3.9% to 7.4% and raises welfare by 1.02%. Along the transition, consumption overshoots its steady state, even as trade and the capital stock grow gradually, so that the change in steady state consumption understates the welfare gain. Models without a dynamic export decision generate more gradual aggregate transition dynamics and smaller gains from trade.

We develop a theory which explains the variation in levels of decentralization across firms and links it to the trade environment that firms face. We introduce firms with internal hierarchies in a Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) model of international trade. We show that international trade increases the conflict of interest between CEO/owners and middle managers within firms and these eventually lead to decentralized corporate hierarchies.

We use plant-level data on exporters' export intensity to identify the changes in iceberg costs over this period. Given this change in iceberg costs, we find that a GE model with heterogeneous establishments and dynamic exporting decision from a sunk cost of starting to export is consistent with both aggregate U.S. export growth and the changes in the number and size of U.S. exporters. The model also captures the gradual response of U.S. exports to the cut in iceberg costs. A model with a static exporting decision generates substantially less trade growth and misses out on the timing of export growth. We also study the interplay between changes in the structure of manufacturing and trade. We find that the growth in trade contributed little to the contraction in U.S. manufacturing while changes in the structure of manufacturing from changes in sectoral productivity, capital intensity, idiosyncratic shocks, and corporate taxation reduced U.S. export growth by as much as 10%.","Alessandria, George & Choi, Horag, 2014.

We aim to empirically disentangle these channels by tracking evolution of corporate transparency for 4061 listed firms in tradable sectors in 49 countries during 1992–2005. By using detailed tariff schedules, we measure changes in growth opportunities and product market competition enabled by foreign and domestic trade liberalizations, respectively. On the one hand, higher growth opportunities engendered by foreign trade reforms are disproportionately associated with better corporate transparency in industries that depend more heavily on external financing. On the other hand, greater product market competition engendered by domestic tariff reductions has no significant impact on corporate transparency.","Tong, Hui & Wei, Shang-Jin, 2014.

Journal of International Economics,Exports versus multinational production under nominal uncertainty,"['Lewis, Logan T.']","This paper examines how nominal uncertainty affects the choice that firms face to serve a foreign market through exports or to produce abroad as a multinational. I develop a two-country, stochastic general equilibrium model in which firms make production and pricing decisions in advance, and I consider its implications for the relative attractiveness of exporting and multinational production. I find that when multinational sales are priced in the local currency while exports are priced in the producer currency, destination volatility benefits exporters: during a foreign nominal contraction, the foreign exchange rate appreciates, causing exports to be relatively cheaper. Exporters gain non-linearly through demand, making profit convex in prices. As foreign volatility rises, the model implies that the home country should serve the foreign country relatively more through exports. I take this implication to bilateral U.S. data, using inflation volatility as a proxy for nominal volatility. Using sectoral data on sales by majority-owned foreign affiliates matched with U.S. exports, I find that higher inflation volatility is associated with a significantly lower ratio of multinational sales to total foreign sales.","Lewis, Logan T., 2014.

In this paper, we construct alternative measures of the stock of external sovereign debt for 100 developing countries from 1979 through 2006 that correct for differences in contractual form and maturity. We show that our alternative measures: (1) paint a very different quantitative, and in some cases also qualitative, picture of the stock of developing country external sovereign debt; (2) often invert rankings of indebtedness across countries, which historically defined eligibility for debt forgiveness; (3) indicate that the empirical performance of the benchmark quantitative model of sovereign debt deteriorates by roughly 50% once model-consistent measures of debt are used; (4) show how the spread of aggregation clauses in debt contracts that award creditors voting power in proportion to the contractual face value may introduce inefficiencies into the process of restructuring sovereign debts; and (5) illustrate how countries have manipulated their debt issuance to meet fiscal targets written in terms of face values.","Dias, Daniel A. & Richmond, Christine & Wright, Mark L.J., 2014.

Using a variety of statistical tools and comprehensive data spanning 1970–2011, we find that the ratio of net foreign liabilities to GDP is a significant crisis predictor. This is primarily due to the net position in debt instruments—the effect of net equity liabilities is weaker and net FDI liabilities seem, if anything, an offset factor. We also find that: i) breaking down net external debt into its gross asset and liability counterparts does not add significant explanatory power to crisis prediction; ii) the current account is a powerful predictor; iii) foreign exchange reserves reduce the likelihood of crisis more than other foreign asset holdings; and iv) a parsimonious probit containing those and a handful of other variables has good predictive performance in- and out-of-sample.

Using data from Mexico and Canada, this paper decomposes these differences in terms of reduced form shocks that affect aggregate efficiency and distort the decisions of households about how much to invest, consume, and work in a standard model of a small open economy. The decomposition exercise suggests that most of these differences are explained by fluctuations in aggregate efficiency, distortions in labor choices over the business cycle, and distortions in intertemporal consumption choices. Successful models for emerging markets fluctuations should include primitive shocks and frictions that generate these features. Models with financial frictions in the form of working capital constraints, possibly augmented with endogenous collateral constraints, are consistent with these findings.","Hevia, Constantino, 2014.

Journal of International Economics,Exporting under trade policy uncertainty: Theory and evidence,"['Handley, Kyle']","I provide novel evidence for the impact of trade policy uncertainty on exporters. In a dynamic, heterogeneous firms model, trade policy uncertainty will delay the entry of exporters into new markets and make them less responsive to applied tariff reductions. Policy instruments that reduce or eliminate uncertainty, such as binding trade policy commitments at the WTO, increase entry. The predictions are tested on disaggregated, product-level Australian imports with model-consistent measures of uncertainty. The estimates show that growth of exporter–product varieties would have been 7% lower between 1993 and 2001 without the binding commitments implemented after the WTO was formed in 1996. If Australia reduced all its tariffs and bindings to zero, more than half of predicted product growth is accounted by removing uncertainty.

We develop a statistical decision model in which a firm updates its prior belief about demand in a foreign market based on several factors, including the number of neighbors currently selling there, the level and heterogeneity of their export sales, and the firm's own prior knowledge about the market. A positive signal about demand inferred from neighbors' export performance raises the firm's probability of entry and initial sales in the market but, conditional on survival, lowers its post-entry growth. These learning effects are stronger when there are more neighbors to learn from or when the firm is less familiar with the market. We find supporting evidence for the main predictions of the model from transaction-level data for all Chinese exporters over the 2000-2006 period.

Firms and their managers acquire knowledge via a variety of different channels which are often difficult to track down and quantify. By matching employer–employee data with trade data at the firm level we show that the export experience acquired by managers in previous firms leads their current firm toward higher export performance, and commands a sizeable wage premium for the manager. Moreover, export knowledge is decisive when it is market-specific: managers with experience related to markets served by their current firm receive an even higher wage premium; firms are more likely to enter markets where their managers have experience; exporters are more likely to stay in those markets, and their sales are on average higher. Our findings are robust to controlling for unobserved heterogeneity and, more broadly, endogeneity and indicate that managers' export experience is a first-order feature in the data with an impact on a firm's export performance that is, for example, at least as strong as that of firm productivity.","Mion, Giordano & Opromolla, Luca David, 2014.

We focus on all major trade liberalization bills introduced since the early 1970s in the U.S. Congress, in which House and Senate members serve respectively two- and six-year terms and one third of senators face elections every two years. We show that senators are more likely to support trade liberalization than House representatives. However, this result does not hold for the last generation of senators, who face elections at the same time as House members, suggesting that inter-cameral differences are driven by term length. Considering senators alone, we find that the last generation is less likely to support trade liberalization than the previous two. This result is pervasive and holds both when comparing the behavior of different senators voting on the same bill and that of individual senators voting on different bills.

The analysis shows that, while there is no case for BTA when all instruments can be freely deployed, Pareto-efficiency does require a form of BTA when carbon taxes in some countries are constrained: its purpose then is to partly counteract the impact on emissions of inappropriate carbon pricing there, or, equivalently, to undo the trade distortions such pricing creates. The required form of BTA is generally complex, but a special case is identified in which it optimally has the simple structure envisaged in practical policy discussions. It is also shown that the efficiency case for BTA depends critically on whether climate policies are pursued by carbon taxation or by cap-and-trade.","Keen, Michael & Kotsogiannis, Christos, 2014.

Offshoring an intermediate is only profitable when it has matured sufficiently and the savings in production cost outweigh the underinvestment due to incomplete contracts abroad. We derive how equilibrium sourcing decisions of different intermediates depend on one another. In particular, we demonstrate that the maturity threshold to offshore additional parts is higher when some other parts are already sourced from the low-wage country. This prediction is robust to an alternative way of modeling the bargaining process, but it only holds if foreign suppliers are held sufficiently close to their reservation wage. If suppliers are able to capture most of the rents, the prediction reverses. Using information on U.S. imports of automotive parts, we illustrate that for most countries the price at which they first export a part tends to be higher for parts that are only exported later, consistent with offshoring becoming gradually more difficult.","Van Biesebroeck, Johannes & Zhang, Lijun, 2014.

However, using disaggregated, employer–employee level data, and allowing for the endogenous assignment of workers to firms due to match-specific productivity, we find that the premium paid to workers at exporting firms is economically and statistically insignificant, as is the differential impact of trade openness on the wages of workers at exporting firms relative to otherwise identical workers at domestic firms. We also find that workforce composition improves systematically in exporting firms, in terms of the combination of worker ability and the quality of worker–firm matches, post-liberalization. These results stand in stark contrast to the findings reported in many earlier studies and underscore the importance of endogenous matching and, more generally, non-random labor market allocation mechanisms, in determining the effects of trade policy changes on wages.","Krishna, Pravin & Poole, Jennifer P. & Senses, Mine Zeynep, 2014.

Journal of International Economics,An information-based theory of international currency,"['Zhang, Cathy']","This paper develops an information-based theory of international currency based on search frictions, private trading histories, and imperfect recognizability of assets. Using an open-economy search model with multiple competing currencies, the value of each currency is determined without requiring agents to use a particular currency to purchase a country's goods. Strategic complementarities in portfolio choices and information acquisition decisions generate multiple equilibria with different types of payment arrangements. While some inflation can benefit the country issuing an international currency, the threat of losing international status puts an inflation discipline on the issuing country. When monetary authorities interact in a simple policy game, the temptation to inflate can lead optimal policy to deviate from the Friedman rule. The calibrated model can produce a welfare cost of losing international status for the issuing country larger than previous findings, though estimates depend critically on inflation rates and information costs.","Zhang, Cathy, 2014.

Journal of International Economics,Optimal fiscal policy in a small open economy with limited commitment,"['Bauducco, Sofia', 'Caprioli, Francesco']","We introduce limited commitment into a standard optimal fiscal policy model in small open economies. We consider the problem of a benevolent government that signs a risk-sharing contract with the rest of the world, and that has to choose optimally distortionary taxes on labor income, domestic debt and international transfers. Both the home country and the rest of the world may have limited commitment, which means that they can leave the contract if they find it convenient. The contract is designed so that, at any point in time, neither party has incentives to exit. We define a small open emerging economy as an economy where the limited commitment problem is active in equilibrium. Conversely, a small open developed economy is an economy in which the commitment problem is not active. Our model is able to rationalize some stylized facts about fiscal policy in emerging economies: i) the volatility of tax revenues over GDP is higher in emerging economies than in developed ones; ii) fiscal policy is procyclical in emerging economies; iii) emerging economies may “graduate” from procyclical fiscal policy and adopt countercyclical policies in the long run.","Bauducco, Sofia & Caprioli, Francesco, 2014.

We show that in this general context there are four motives for non-cooperative trade policies: the correction of monopolistic distortions; the terms-of-trade manipulation; the delocation motive for protection (home market effect); the fiscal-burden-shifting motive. The Nash equilibrium when all instruments are available is characterized by first-best-level wage subsidies, and inefficient import subsidies and export taxes, which aim at relocating firms to the other economy and improving terms of trade.

I use the calibrated model to calculate the gains that a country would experience from liberalizing access to foreign firms.

Contrary to models where openness can be summarized by the degree of home bias, we find that openness can be a poor proxy of the welfare impact of alternative monetary policies. Using input–output data for 25 countries we document substantial differences in the import and non-tradable content of final demand components, and in the role played by imported inputs in domestic production.

Three socioeconomic groups are involved: two elite groups and workers, whose preferences regarding trade policy and income taxation are derived from a simple open-economy model. The critical point is that income taxation induces a rich–poor/elite–workers political cleavage, while trade policy opens the door to intra-elite conflict. In this model, when there is no intra-elite conflict, changes in trade policy are associated with political transitions. Coups (democratizations) open up the economy if and only if both elite groups are pro-free-trade (protectionist). However, in the presence of intra-elite conflict, autocracies respond to popular revolts by changing trade policy and reallocating political power within the elite (to the elite group with the same trade policy preference as the workers) rather than offering to democratize the country. The change in trade policy is credible because the elite group with the same trade policy preference as the workers controls the autocracy. Moreover, in the presence of intra-elite conflict, coups tend to result in the maintenance of the existing trade policy unless popular demands are extremely radical and/or the elite group with the same trade policy preference as the workers is exceptionally weak.","Galiani, Sebastian & Torrens, Gustavo, 2014.

Since geography may affect income through other channels, we also control for climate, disease environment, natural resources, and colonial origins. Most importantly, we also account for the roles of institutions and early development. Our instrumental-variables estimates provide evidence of a robust, positive effect of openness to immigration on long-run income per capita. In contrast, we are unable to establish an effect of trade openness on income.

Our approach, which can be implemented without repeated cross-sections of household level data, suits well the data constraints in SSA. It also allows us to capture the heterogeneity in trade protection at the tariff line level. The pro-poor bias indicators suggest that SSA's trade policies tend to be biased in favor of poor households, as these policies redistribute income from rich to poor households. This is because protection increases the agricultural prices of goods that are sold by African households and this effect dominates both the impacts of higher consumption prices and the strong Stolper–Samuelson effects that benefit skilled over unskilled workers.","Nicita, Alessandro & Olarreaga, Marcelo & Porto, Guido, 2014.

Whether a particular EME receives a surge, and the magnitude of that surge, however, depends largely on domestic factors such as its external financing need, capital account openness, and exchange rate regime. Differentiating between surges driven by exceptional behavior of asset flows (repatriation of foreign assets by domestic residents) from those driven by exceptional behavior of liability flows (nonresident investments into the country), shows the latter to be relatively more sensitive to global factors and contagion.","Ghosh, Atish R. & Qureshi, Mahvash S. & Kim, Jun Il & Zalduendo, Juan, 2014.

CACs are assessed security by security. Using a panel data approach, we find a U-shaped effect of CACs on yields according to the credit rating of the issuer. While the impact is negligible for the highest ratings, a significant yield discount emerges for mid-range ratings, which is smaller for bad ratings and possibly insignificant for the worst ratings. This relationship appears fairly robust across a number of checks. This evidence may reflect the fact that CACs are valuable because they help with orderly restructuring unless the perceived probability of default is too small. Nevertheless, at low ratings, this effect can be weakened by an increasing risk of moral hazard.","Bardozzetti, Alfredo & Dottori, Davide, 2014.

Journal of International Economics,"A model of demand, productivity and foreign location decision among Taiwanese firms","['Aw, Bee Yan', 'Lee, Yi']","We develop a theoretical framework to examine the relative importance of firm demand and productivity in firm decisions to export and where to locate foreign direct investments. The model shows that the equilibrium firm decision depends on product technology, consumer preference for product quality, fixed investment costs of establishing a foreign subsidiary, transportation costs and relative wages. Our empirical results confirm the predictions of the theoretical model. Firm-level demand and productivity components are important in explaining the decision to participate in foreign markets with their relative importance depending on the firm's organizational form (exports versus FDI) and the destination of the investments. In general, FDI firms are more productive than exporting firms regardless of FDI destinations. FDI firms also have a higher demand component than exporters and this demand component is stronger than productivity. Finally, among FDI firms, while those with a high demand index and productivity have a significantly higher propensity to invest in high-income countries, firm productivity is the sole determinant of firms undertaking FDI in low-income countries.","Aw, Bee Yan & Lee, Yi, 2014.

We develop a tractable multi-country, multi-industry model of trade with unobservable skills in the labour market and show that comparative advantage derives from (i) cross-industry differences in the substitutability of workers' skills and (ii) cross-country differences in the dispersion of skills. We establish the conditions under which higher skill dispersion leads to specialization in industries characterized by higher skill substitutability across tasks. The main results are robust when the model is extended to allow for partial observability of skills.

Journal of International Economics,The impacts of trade liberalization on informal labor markets: A theoretical and empirical evaluation of the Brazilian case,"['Paz, Lourenço S.']","Following trade liberalization, several developing countries experienced a sharp increase in the share of informal manufacturing employment. In this paper, I examine the impacts of trade liberalization on the labor markets of a small open economy, in an environment in which tariffs affect firms' payroll tax compliance decisions. I demonstrate that a reduction in domestic import tariffs reduces the average formal wage and show that the direction of the effect on the share of informal employment depends on the initial labor market conditions. A cut in trading partner import tariffs decreases the share of domestic informal employment and increases the average formal wage. I confirm the model's principal findings empirically, using data from the 1989–2001 Brazilian trade liberalization episode. I find the results robust to endogeneity and self-selection concerns, which are addressed, respectively, using instrumental variable and switching regression approaches.","Paz, Lourenço S., 2014.

Journal of International Economics,"Factor Intensity, product switching, and productivity: Evidence from Chinese exporters","['Ma, Yue', 'Tang, Heiwai', 'Zhang, Yifan']","This paper analyzes how a firm's specialization in its core products after exporting affects its factor intensity and productivity. Using Chinese manufacturing firm data for the 1998–2007 period, we find that firms become less capital-intensive but more productive after exporting, compared to non-exporters that share similar ex ante characteristics. To rationalize these findings that contrast with existing studies, we develop a variant of the model by Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2010, 2011) to consider firms producing multiple products with varying capital intensity. The model predicts that when a firm in a labor-abundant country starts exporting, it specializes in its core competencies by allocating more resources to produce more labor-intensive products. Firm ex ante productivity is associated with a smaller decline in capital intensity after exporting. A sharper post-export decline in capital intensity is associated with a larger increase in measured total factor productivity. We find firm-level evidence supporting these predictions. Using transaction-level data for the 2000–2006 period, we show that Chinese new exporters add products that are less capital-intensive than their existing products and drop those that are more capital-intensive in subsequent years.","Ma, Yue & Tang, Heiwai & Zhang, Yifan, 2014.

Journal of International Economics,"International trade, risk taking and welfare","['Vannoorenberghe, G.']","This paper shows that the gains from opening up to international trade are smaller when firms do not fully internalize downward risk. I develop a general equilibrium model with two key assumptions. First, when faced with adverse productivity shocks, employers can lay off workers without fully paying the social costs of their layoff decisions, a common feature of many institutions. Second, when opening to international trade, the elasticity of demand perceived by an industry increases. In this setup, I show that international trade induces firms to take more risk and (i) raises the equilibrium unemployment rate, (ii) increases the volatility of sectoral sales and (iii) increases welfare proportionately less than in the absence of the externality. Inducing firms to internalize the costs of layoff (Blanchard and Tirole, 2003) therefore appears even more important in a globalized world.","Vannoorenberghe, G., 2014.

Journal of International Economics,"Comparative advantage, service trade, and global imbalances","['Barattieri, Alessandro']","The large current account deficit of the U.S. is the result of a large deficit in the goods balance and a modest surplus in the service balance. The opposite is true for Japan, Germany, and China. Moreover, I document the emergence from the mid-nineties of a strong negative relation between specialization in the export of services and the current account balances of a large sample of OECD and developing countries. Starting from these new stylized facts, I propose in this paper a service hypothesis for global imbalances, a new explanation based on the interplay between the U.S. comparative advantage in services and the asymmetric trade liberalization process in goods trade versus service trade that took place starting in the mid-nineties. First, I use a structural gravity model to show that service trade liberalization lagged behind goods trade liberalization, and I quantify the extent of this asymmetry. Second, I show that a simple two-period model can rationalize the emergence of current account deficits in the presence of such asymmetric liberalization. The key inter-temporal mechanism is the asymmetric timing of trade policies, which affects saving decisions. Finally, I explore the quantitative relevance of this explanation for global imbalances. I introduce trade costs in an otherwise standard 2-sector 2-country international real business cycle model. When fed with the asymmetric trade liberalization path found in the data, the model generates a trade deficit of about 5% of GDP. I conclude that the service hypothesis for global imbalances is quantitatively relevant.","Barattieri, Alessandro, 2014.

Journal of International Economics,"International capital flows, returns and world financial integration","['Evans, Martin D.D.', 'Hnatkovska, Viktoria V.']","International capital flows have increased dramatically since the 1980s, with much of the increase being due to trade in equity and bond markets. Such developments are often attributed to the increased integration of world financial markets. We present a model that allows us to examine how greater integration in world financial markets affects the behavior of international capital flows and financial returns. Our model predicts that international capital flows are large (in absolute value) and very volatile during the early stages of financial integration when international asset trading is concentrated in bonds. As integration progresses and households gain access to world equity markets, the size and volatility of international bond flows decline. This is the natural outcome of greater risk sharing facilitated by increased integration. This pattern is consistent with declining volatility observed during 1975–2007 period in the G-7 countries. We also find that the equilibrium flows in bonds and stocks predicted by the model are larger than their empirical counterparts, and are largely driven by variations in equity risk premia. The model also predicts that volatility of equity and bond returns decline with integration, again consistent with the data for G-7 economies.","Evans, Martin D.D. & Hnatkovska, Viktoria V., 2014.

We argue that the Canadian–US free trade agreement (CUSFTA) provides an ideal policy experiment to link this mechanism to the data.

Journal of International Economics,Resource-based FDI and expropriation in developing economies,"['Hajzler, Christopher']","Globally, foreign direct investment (FDI) assets are expropriated more in resource extraction industries compared to other sectors. Despite the higher apparent risk of expropriation in resources, countries more likely to expropriate also have a larger share of FDI in the resource sector. An incomplete markets model of FDI is developed to account for this puzzle. The type of government regime is stochastic, with low penalty regimes facing a relatively low, exogenous cost of expropriating FDI, and country risk is measured by the variation in these costs across different regimes. The key innovation of the model is that the government, before the regime type is known, is able to charge different prices to domestic and foreign investors for mineral rights. Granting cheap access increases FDI and reduces the country's share of resource rents, increasing the temptation to expropriate in a relatively low penalty regime. In very high-risk countries, subsidizing resource FDI increases the total value of output by raising investment, and the net gains from expropriating in a low penalty regime outweigh the rents foregone under a high penalty one. However, a stochastic resource output price results in relatively low-risk countries restricting FDI inflows to the resource sector instead — “windfall profits” in this sector raise incentives to expropriate when prices are high, yet minimization of the ex ante risk of expropriation is preferred owing to the relatively high penalty for expropriating. These results imply a higher average share of resource-based FDI in countries most likely to expropriate, while resources account for a high share of expropriated assets compared to the sector's global share of FDI. We show that the model is able to reconcile observed patterns of foreign investment and expropriation for a sample of 38 developing and emerging economies.","Hajzler, Christopher, 2014.

Due to lack of alternative data, the measures employed in the existing literature are typically based on non-PPP-adjusted trade data denominated by PPP-adjusted GDP data. The present paper seeks to resolve this inconsistency by constructing new trade share estimates for 62 countries, representing 90% of world GDP, for the period from 1870 to 1949. Our estimates combine historical import and export figures with non-PPP-adjusted GDP values that we estimate via the short-cut method. Our estimates confirm qualitatively the narrative of a dramatic rise and fall of world trade over this period. Yet, they indicate that this rise and fall was quantitatively much more pronounced.

We analyze how different combinations of tariffs – on imported consumption goods, intermediate inputs, and capital goods – and taxes – on consumption, labor income and capital income – affect the transitional and long-run welfare. We report three main findings. First, trade liberalization programs financed by consumption and labor income taxes tend to result in substantial welfare gains, but financing the lost tariff revenue through capital income taxes can have an adverse impact on welfare. Second, a significant fraction of welfare changes is due to transitional effects stemming from the allocation of resources in response to changes in tariffs and taxes. Third, trade liberalization and fiscal reform programs often translate into much larger welfare gains in countries that are more open to international financial markets.","Kim, Sunghyun H. & Kose, M.

Importantly, we show that the impact of the WTO is concentrated almost exclusively on the extensive product margin of trade, i.e. trade in goods that were not previously traded. In our preferred specification, WTO membership increases the extensive margin of exports by 25%. At the same time, WTO membership has a negative impact on the intensive margin. Based on novel comparative statics results about how fixed and variable trade costs impact the product margins of trade, our results suggest that WTO membership works by reducing primarily the fixed rather than the variable costs of trade.","Dutt, Pushan & Mihov, Ilian & Van Zandt, Timothy, 2013.

Can women (or households with a daughter) dis-save? What are the conditions under which aggregate savings would go up in response to a higher sex ratio?

We also find that the bulk of the decrease in the number of exporters is exerted by less productive exporters, by direct exporters as opposed to trade intermediaries, and by single-product direct exporters as opposed to their multi-product counterparts. Combined with the existing studies on the effects that antidumping investigations have on protected firms, our study helps piece together a complete picture of the effects of antidumping investigations.","Lu, Yi & Tao, Zhigang & Zhang, Yan, 2013.

We treat denominations akin to multinational enterprises, which decide which countries to enter based on local market conditions and their own “productivity.” The model guides us in estimating how a denomination's religious doctrine and governance structure affect its ability to attract adherents. Using data on the foreign operations of US Protestant denominations in 2005 from the World Christian Database, we find that (1) denominations with stricter religious doctrine attract more adherents in countries in which the risk of natural disaster or disease outbreak is greater and in which government provision of health services is weaker, and (2) denominations with a decentralized governance structure attract more adherents in countries in which the pastor cost of connecting with congregants is lower. These findings illuminate factors shaping the composition of religion within countries, helping account for the rise of new Protestant groups.

According to the first, exports between similarly endowed countries (“South–South” and “North–North”) are more diversified than exports between differently endowed countries (“South–North” and “North–South”). The second implication is that, for given countries' production patterns, low bilateral trade costs lead to greater export diversification. These predictions find empirical support in a panel of 102 trade partners and 4998 HS-6 industries over the period 1995–2007. Results show that similarities between trading partners in physical capital, land and human capital endowments per worker are associated with more diversified bilateral exports.

The second one is “product productivity”, defined as firms' ability to develop high-quality products spending small fixed outlays. The distinction between these two sources of productivity, together with the assumption that iceberg trade costs decrease with quality, delivers various conditional exporter premia as theoretical predictions. Conditional on size, exporters sell higher quality products, charge higher prices, pay higher input prices and higher wages, and use capital more intensively. Some of these predictions had already been documented in the empirical literature but lacked a theoretical framework for properly interpreting them.

We attempt to provide a theoretical background for these findings and focus on the North–South productivity differences in a four country North–South trade model with two dimensions of firm heterogeneity.

To do so, we examine the first wave of light-truck offshoring to Mexico that occurred due to substantially lower post-NAFTA trade barriers and a coincident increase in US demand for light trucks. In contrast to the typical assumption, but similar to many other industries, the need for additional capacity was accommodated by investment in both the US and Mexico for the same models of light trucks. Using a new dataset that details the extent of offshoring and domestic production within models, we document sharp differences in how capacity was utilized. Specifically, within models, we find that automakers offshored varieties which tend to be older in design vintage, lower scale, and less complex to produce. In contrast, we find that varieties “inshored” to newer capacity in the US exhibit the opposite characteristics. This highlights the important role of vertical differentiation and the associated variation in production complexity for the sorting of production across borders. A product with a large degree of vertical differentiation may provide scope for a firm to maximize profits by “inshoring” the more complex varieties while offshoring the less complex versions.","McCalman, Phillip & Spearot, Alan, 2013.

Our key findings are as follows. First, if the true model can be appropriately characterized as a set of linear equations, then linearity tests that utilize univariate autoregressions of the real exchange rate suffer from an omitted variables problem, which leads them to overestimate the true incidence of nonlinearity. Consequently, studies that fail to control for this problem may spuriously find evidence of nonlinearities in the data, despite the fact that the data generating process may be linear. Second, we propose a strategy that can largely eliminate this distortion. Finally, we find that DSGE models solved using higher order approximations are capable of generating true structural nonlinearities in real exchange rates both asymptotically and in short samples.","Ahmad, Yamin & Lo, Ming Chien & Mykhaylova, Olena, 2013.

In order to account for the potential endogeneity of meetings with the Dalai Lama, the number of Tibet Support Groups and the travel pattern of the Tibetan leader are used as instruments. Our empirical results support the idea that countries officially receiving the Dalai Lama at the highest political level are punished through a reduction of their exports to China.

Journal of International Economics,"Estimating productivity with multi-product firms, pricing heterogeneity and the role of international trade","['Smeets, Valerie', 'Warzynski, Frederic']","In this paper, we analyze the relationship between exports, imports and firm productivity taking into account pricing heterogeneity and multi-product firms. We use a rich firm–product level dataset providing both revenue and quantities of all products produced, exported and imported for a large panel of Danish manufacturing firms over the period 1999–2006. With this detailed information, we compute a firm level price index to deflate our measure of output and compare our productivity measures when we deflate output with an industry-level deflator. We find that firms only importing have a large productivity premium, but not firms only involved in exporting, while firms involved in both importing and exporting are the most productive. The international trade premia are found to be significantly larger when output is deflated with our firm-specific price index rather than the traditional sector-level PPI, suggesting that pricing heterogeneity plays an important role in productivity measurement. We also find evidence of a self-selection into exporting but not into importing. Finally, we detect the presence of learning by exporting only when we control for pricing heterogeneity; when looking at learning by importing, we find a positive effect in the long run, but the effect is lower when we deflate revenue with a firm-specific price index. These results suggest that pricing heterogeneity can significantly affect the way we measure productivity and our assessment about the link between productivity and trade.","Smeets, Valerie & Warzynski, Frederic, 2013.

Journal of International Economics,Spiders and snakes: Offshoring and agglomeration in the global economy,"['Baldwin, Richard', 'Venables, Anthony J.']","Global production sharing is determined by international cost differences and frictions related to the costs of unbundling stages spatially. The interaction between these forces depends on engineering details of the production process with two extremes being ‘snakes’ and ‘spiders’. Snakes are processes whose sequencing is dictated by engineering; spiders involve the assembly of parts in no particular order. This paper studies spatial unbundling as frictions fall, showing that outcomes are very different for snakes and spiders, even if they share some features. Both snakes and spiders have in common a property that lower frictions produce discontinuous location changes and ‘overshooting’. Parts may move against their comparative costs because of proximity benefits, and further reductions in frictions lead these parts to be ‘reshored’. Predictions for trade volumes and the number of fragmented stages are quite different in the two cases. For spiders, a part crosses borders at most twice; the value of trade increases monotonically as frictions fall, except when the assembler relocates and the direction of parts trade is reversed. For snakes the volume of trade and number of endogenously determined stages is bounded only by the fragmentation of the underlying engineering process, and lower frictions monotonically increase trade volumes.","Baldwin, Richard & Venables, Anthony J., 2013.

Journal of International Economics,Putting per-capita income back into trade theory,"['Markusen, James R.']","A major role for per-capita income in international trade, as opposed to simply country size, was persuasively advanced by many early economists including Linder (1961), Kuznets (1966), and Chenery and Syrquin (1975). Yet this crucial element of their story was abandon by most later trade economists in favor of the analytically-tractable but counter-empirical assumption that all countries share identical and homothetic preferences. This paper presents a set of assumptions which produces multiple results when they hold jointly. Most of these results are novel, but several that are implicit or explicit in earlier literature are also noted for completeness. Adding non-homothetic preferences to traditional models helps explain such diverse phenomena as a growing skill premium, the mystery of the missing trade, home bias in consumption, the behavior of trade to GDP ratios, and the role of intra-country income distribution, from the demand side of general equilibrium. With imperfect competition, we can explain higher markups and higher price levels in higher per-capita income countries, and the puzzle that gravity equations show a positive dependence of trade on per-capita-incomes, aggregate income held constant. The model also predicts horizontal multinational activity is negatively related to per-capita income differences between countries.","Markusen, James R., 2013.

We suggest a process of specialization to explain these facts. Windfall revenue induces labor to move from the (traded) manufacturing to the (non-traded) non-manufacturing sector. A self-selection of workers takes place. Only those most skilled in manufacturing sector work remain in manufacturing. Workers that move to non-manufacturing however, will be less skilled at non-manufacturing sector work than those who were already employed there. Resource-induced structural transformation thus results in higher productivity in manufacturing and lower productivity in non-manufacturing. We construct and calibrate a two-sector, open economy model of self-selection and show that exogenous cross-country variation in natural resource endowments is large enough to explain the direction and magnitude of sectoral employment and productivity differences between resource-rich and resource-poor regions. The model implies that low aggregate productivity found in some resource-rich countries is not caused by a resource-induced decline of a relatively productive manufacturing sector. Rather, the higher manufacturing productivity in those countries is a consequence of manufacturing's smaller size.","Kuralbayeva, Karlygash & Stefanski, Radoslaw, 2013.

Using an empirical model, we find substantial heterogeneity in reactions to these shocks across countries. In comparison to the U.S. and other developed countries, emerging economies suffer much more severe falls in investment and private consumption following an exogenous uncertainty shock, take significantly longer to recover, and do not experience a subsequent overshoot in activity. We provide evidence that the dynamics of investment and consumption are correlated with the depth of financial markets. We control for the potential role of a credit channel, and estimate that it can account for up to one-half of the increased fall in investment generated by uncertainty shocks among emerging economies with less-developed financial markets. In this context, monetary and fiscal policy actions that alleviate the impact of credit constraints facing firms may reduce the impact of uncertainty shocks in these economies.","Carrière-Swallow, Yan & Céspedes, Luis Felipe, 2013.

We show that multinational firms are able to shift profits abroad even if they fully comply with the tax code. This is because, in equilibrium, intra-firm transactions occur in firms that are better than the market at input production. Moreover, market input prices include a mark-up that arises from the bargaining between the firm and the independent supplier. Transfer prices set at market values following the arm's length principle thus systematically exceed multinationals' marginal costs, leading to a reduction of tax payments for each unit sold. The optimal organization of firms hence provides a new rationale for the empirically observed lower tax burden of multinational corporations.","Bauer, Christian J. & Langenmayr, Dominika, 2013.

Global retail chains and their implications for Romania,"['Javorcik, Beata S.', 'Li, Yue']","During the past two decades many countries have opened their retail sector to foreign direct investment (FDI), yet little is known about the implications of such liberalization for their economies. Using a unique dataset combining outlet-specific information on global retail chains with a panel of Romanian manufacturing firms, this study sheds some light on this question. The results suggest that the expansion of global retail chains leads to a significant increase in the total factor productivity (TFP) in the supplying manufacturing industries: a 10% increase in the number of foreign chains' outlets is associated with a 2.4% to 2.6% boost to the TFP in the supplying industries. The decomposition of the aggregate productivity in the supplying industries suggests that the boost to performance is driven by both within-firm improvements and between-firm reallocation. Both changes are found to be associated with the expansion of foreign chains. These conclusions are robust to a variety of specifications and supported by evidence from a firm-level survey. They suggest that the opening of the retail sector to FDI may stimulate productivity growth and improve allocation efficiency in manufacturing industries and thus provide another piece of evidence in favor of services liberalization.","Javorcik, Beata S. & Li, Yue, 2013.

In a model of strategic trade policy, we show that the impact of a negative rainfall shock on optimal import tariffs is generally ambiguous, depending on the weight placed by the domestic policy maker on tariff revenue, profits and the consumer surplus. The more weight placed on domestic profits, the more likely it is that the policy maker will respond to a rainfall shortage by reducing import tariffs. These findings are robust to alternative assumptions about market structure and the timing of the game. Using detailed panel data on applied tariffs and rainfall for 70 nations, we find robust evidence that rainfall shortages generally induce policy makers to set lower tariffs on agricultural imports.","Bastos, Paulo & Straume, Odd Rune & Urrego, Jaime A., 2013.

The usual controls for scale, composition and technique effects are added to the estimated model and the endogeneity of income and trade variables is modeled using instruments. The main results indicate that the CO2 emissions of the pairs of countries that belong to an RTA with environmental provisions tend to converge and are lower in absolute terms, whereas this is not the case for RTAs without environmental provisions.

Using a theoretical model with downstream firms exhibiting different levels of productivity, we show that lower input tariffs may increase the export sales of high-productivity firms at the expense of low-productivity firms and may decrease the probability of firms entering foreign markets. We compare the predictions of the theoretical model with firm-level data from the French agrifood sector by developing a two-stage estimation procedure that uses an equation for selection into export markets in the first stage and an export's equation in the second stage. The liberalization of agricultural trade appears to favor the reallocation of market share from low- to high-productivity agrifood firms. In addition, our results suggest that, whether lower input tariffs increase total export sales (and jobs), a large fraction of the least productive exporting firms may lose from an additional decrease in agricultural input tariffs.","Chevassus-Lozza, Emmanuelle & Gaigné, Carl & Le Mener, Léo, 2013.

We find evidence of a strong countercyclical trade policy response in the pre-Great Recession period of 1988:Q1–2008:Q3 during which increases in domestic unemployment rates, real appreciations in bilateral exchange rates, and declines in the GDP growth rates of bilateral trading partners led to substantial increases in new temporary trade barriers. We then apply this pre-Great Recession empirical model to realized macroeconomic data from 2008:Q4 to 2010:Q4 and find that it predicts a surge of new import protection during the Great Recession — e.g., for the US and EU, the model predicts that new trade barriers would cover an additional 15 percentage points of nonoil imports, well above the baseline level of 2–3% of import coverage immediately preceding the crisis. Finally, we examine why the realized trade policy response differed from model predictions. While exchange rate movements played an important role in limiting new import protection during the Great Recession, we provide evidence of one particularly important change in trade policy responsiveness; i.e., in this period, governments refrained from imposing new temporary trade barriers against foreign trading partners experiencing their own weak or negative economic growth.","Bown, Chad P. & Crowley, Meredith A., 2013.

The presence of sunk export entry costs and efficiency uncertainty gives rise to hysteresis in export market participation. A firm will enter into the export market once it achieves a given size, reflecting its efficiency, but may keep exporting even after its efficiency has fallen below its initial entry level. Some exporters will not be selling as much in the domestic market as other firms that never entered the foreign market. The model captures the qualitative features of firm birth, growth, export market entry and exit, and death found in the empirical literature. We calibrate the model to match relevant statistics of firms' turnover and export dynamics in the United States, and show that the mode of globalization (a reduction in sunk costs as opposed to overhead costs), matters for a firm's selection and persistence in export status. Trade liberalization via a reduction in sunk export entry costs reduces a firm's export status persistence, while the opposite happens when liberalization takes place through a reduction in overhead export costs.","Impullitti, Giammario & Irarrazabal, Alfonso A. & Opromolla, Luca David, 2013.

The purpose of this study is to provide the first systematic empirical analysis of the economic determinants of BITs and of the likelihood of BITs between pairs of countries using a qualitative choice model, in a manner consistent with explaining PTAs. We develop the econometric specification for explaining the two based upon a general equilibrium model of world trade and foreign direct investment with three factors, two products, and trade and investment costs among multiple countries in the presence of national and multinational firms. The empirical model for BITs and PTAs is bivariate in nature and supports a set of hypotheses drawn from the general equilibrium model. Using the preferred empirical model for a sample of 12,880 country-pairs in the year 2000, we predict correctly 88% of all pairs with a BIT and a PTA, 81% with a BIT but no PTA, and 84% with a PTA but no BIT.","Bergstrand, Jeffrey H. & Egger, Peter, 2013.

Previous studies have looked at the role of backward linkages with domestic suppliers and their effects on domestic competitors. In this paper, we study how these externalities are affected by technological incompatibilities between foreign and domestic technologies. When foreign technologies require specialized inputs, some local suppliers self-select into production for multinational firms. A decrease in the cost of inputs compatible with the foreign technology has heterogeneous effects. It benefits foreign firms and the most productive downstream domestic firms that adopt the foreign technology, and negatively affects firms using the domestic technology. Technological incompatibilities reduce the welfare gains from openness to FDI, but this negative effect can be overcome by domestic technology adoption. The model's predictions are consistent with the stylized facts drawn from the empirical literature on FDI spillovers.","Carluccio, Juan & Fally, Thibault, 2013.

This paper develops a political economy model of trade policy under imperfect competition to provide a positive explanation for the prevalence of free trade areas. In a three‐country setting, a representative from each prospective member is elected to determine the tariffs to be applied on imported goods. Under a customs union, the necessity to coordinate tariffs leads voters to strategically delegate power to more protectionist representatives. We show that strategic delegation may imply that free trade areas increase the prospective member countries' welfare compared to customs unions. Moreover, the model also indicates conditions under which free trade areas are more likely to be politically viable than customs unions.","Facchini, Giovanni & Silva, Peri & Willmann, Gerald, 2013.

Managers appropriate the surplus training creates and in the open economy managers face a cross-country trade-off between labor costs and the value of knowledge transfer. Complementarity between country level efficiency and managerial knowledge makes learning more valuable in the North meaning that high knowledge managers choose to work in the North and globalization precipitates a brain drain of high knowledge Southern agents to the North.

It does so by using firm-level panel data from India along with an objective measure of judicial efficiency at the state level. The results suggest that for a 10 percentage point decline in input tariffs, firms in the state at the 75th percentile of judicial efficiency gain an additional 3.6 percentage points in productivity when compared to firms in the state with the median level of judicial efficiency. The results also indicate that the complementarities are strongest for firms in industries that are contract intensive and imported-capital intensive. These results are robust to using a matching estimator to address the self-selection of firms into states with high judicial efficiency and an IV approach to instrument input tariffs. In addition, the results are also robust to the addition of state–year interaction fixed effects to control for time-varying, unobservable state characteristics. Thus, the results indicate that rapid contract enforcement is necessary to maximize the productivity benefits from input tariff liberalization.","Ahsan, Reshad N., 2013.

A decomposition analysis shows that the strong increase in the exporter wage gap, conditional on workers' skill levels, contributed to the growth in wage inequality, whereas the increase in the exporters' share in total employment worked towards a reduction in wage dispersion. The resulting net contribution is positive (inequality-increasing) but moderate. These findings are consistent with recent heterogeneous-firm trade models that feature an exporter wage premium as well as variability of the premium with respect to increasing trade liberalisation.","Baumgarten, Daniel, 2013.

Trade is more sensitive to trade costs if the exporting country only provides a small share of the destination country's imports. As a result, trade costs have a heterogeneous impact across country pairs, with some trade flows predicted to be zero.

Journal of International Economics,"Firm entry, trade, and welfare in Zipf's world","['di Giovanni, Julian', 'Levchenko, Andrei A.']","Firm size follows Zipf's Law, a very fat-tailed distribution that implies a few large firms account for a disproportionate share of overall economic activity. This distribution of firm size is crucial for evaluating the welfare impact of economic policies such as barriers to entry or trade liberalization. Using a multi-country model of production and trade calibrated to the observed distribution of firm size, we show that the welfare impact of high entry costs is small. In the sample of the 50 largest economies in the world, a reduction in entry costs all the way to the U.S. level leads to an average increase in welfare of only 3.25%. In addition, when the firm size distribution follows Zipf's Law, the welfare impact of the extensive margin of trade – newly imported goods at or near the exporting cutoff – is negligible. The extensive margin of imports accounts for only about 5.2% of the total gains from a 10% reduction in trade barriers in our model. This is because under Zipf's Law, the large, infra-marginal firms have a far greater welfare impact than the much smaller firms that comprise the extensive margin in these policy experiments. The distribution of firm size matters for these results: in a counterfactual model economy that does not exhibit Zipf's Law the gains from a reduction in fixed entry barriers are an order of magnitude larger, while the gains from a reduction in variable trade costs are an order of magnitude smaller.","di Giovanni, Julian & Levchenko, Andrei A., 2013.

Journal of International Economics,Default risk and risk averse international investors,"['Lizarazo, Sandra Valentina']","This paper develops an endogenous default risk model for small open economies that interact with risk averse international investors whose preferences exhibit decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA). By incorporating risk averse investors who trade with an emerging economy, the present model explains a larger proportion and volatility of the spread between sovereign bonds and riskless assets than the standard model with risk neutral investors. The paper shows that if investors have DARA preferences, then the emerging economy's default risk, capital flows, and bond prices are a function not only of the fundamentals of the economy but also of the level of financial wealth and risk aversion of international investors. In particular, as investors become wealthier or less risk averse, the emerging economy becomes less credit constrained. As a result, the emerging economy's default risk is lower, and its bond prices and capital inflows are higher. Additionally, with risk averse investors, the risk premium in the asset prices of the sovereign countries can be decomposed into two components: a base premium that compensates the investors for the probability of default and an “excess” premium that compensates them for taking the risk of default.","Lizarazo, Sandra Valentina, 2013.

This paper shows that this allocation puzzle can be explained simply by introducing uninsurable idiosyncratic investment risk in the neoclassical growth model with international trade in bonds, and by taking into account not only TFP catch-up, but also the capital wedge, that is, the distortions on the return to capital. The model fits the two following facts, documented on a sample of 67 countries between 1980 and 2003: (i) TFP growth is positively correlated with capital outflows in a sample including creditor countries; (ii) the long-run level of capital per efficient unit of labor is positively correlated with capital outflows. Consistently, we show that the capital flows predicted by the model are positively correlated with the actual ones in this sample once the capital wedge is accounted for. The fact that Asia dominates global imbalances can be explained by its relatively low capital wedge.","Benhima, Kenza, 2013.

Sales of smaller plants and more marginal products are compressed and are more likely to cease, whereas those of larger plants and core products seem relatively impervious to the shock. This implies a reallocation in terms of market shares within firms and between firms.

We distinguish between two trade cost reductions, (i) trade liberalizations in the 1980s, which increased trade in low-skill-intensive goods (denoted L-globalization) and (ii) reductions in communication costs due to the IT revolution, which raised trade in middle-skill-intensive goods during the 1990s (denoted C-globalization). We consider a North–south trade economy in which the North is skill abundant. A freely traded final good is produced using high-skill services and a bundle of inputs. Inputs differ on the intensity of middle- and low-skill workers required to be produced, and are subject to heterogeneous trade costs. In the North, we find that wage inequality increases in the L-globalization. During the C-globalization, wage polarization emerges. The relative wage of high- to middle-skill workers increases, while the relative wage of middle- to low-skill workers is hump-shaped. We find a complementarity between the two globalizations. Wage polarization is delayed by the extent of trade in the L-globalization. In the South, we find that wage inequality increases in both globalizations. Finally, we show how asymmetric participation in the C-globalization of two southern countries generates a discontinuous pattern of specialization. The southern country participating in the C-globalization specializes in the least and most skill-intensive traded inputs.","Basco, Sergi & Mestieri, Martí, 2013.

We then consider a higher dimensional version of the model which is calibrated to data for China and India.

Journal of International Economics,The arm's length principle and distortions to multinational firm organization,"['Keuschnigg, Christian', 'Devereux, Michael P.']","To prevent profit shifting by manipulation of transfer prices, tax authorities typically apply the arm's length principle in corporate taxation and use comparable market prices to ‘correctly’ assess the value of intracompany trade and royalty income of multinationals. We develop a model of firms subject to financing frictions and offshoring of intermediate inputs. We find that arm's length prices systematically differ from prices set by independent agents. Application of the principle distorts multinational activity by reducing debt capacity and investment of foreign affiliates. Although it raises tax revenue and welfare in the headquarter country, welfare losses may be larger in the subsidiary location, leading to a loss in world welfare.","Keuschnigg, Christian & Devereux, Michael P., 2013.

Journal of International Economics,International capital flows and credit market imperfections: A tale of two frictions,"['Martin, Alberto', 'Taddei, Filippo']","The financial crisis of 2007–08 has underscored the importance of adverse selection in financial markets. This friction has been mostly neglected by macroeconomic models of financial imperfections, which have focused almost exclusively on the effects of limited pledgeability. In this paper, we fill this gap by developing a standard growth model with adverse selection. Our main results are that, by fostering unproductive investment, adverse selection: (i) leads to an increase in the economy's equilibrium interest rate, and; (ii) it generates a negative wedge between the marginal return to investment and the equilibrium interest rate. Under international financial integration, we show how this translates into excessive capital inflows and endogenous cycles. We also extend our model to the more general case in which adverse selection and limited pledgeability coexist. We conclude that both frictions complement one another and show that limited pledgeability exacerbates the effects of adverse selection.","Martin, Alberto & Taddei, Filippo, 2013.

In this class of models, the scope for policy intervention arises because individual agents do not internalize the effects of their action on a key market price that enters the collateral constraint (i.e. there is a pecuniary externality). Our main result is that the interaction between agents' behavior in crisis and normal times is crucial for the normative implications of this class of models. In contrast to the related literature, we find that in our model economy the social planner borrows more than private agents in normal times (i.e., the economy displays “underborrowing” rather than “overborrowing” in normal times) and yet has a lower probability to enter a financial crisis. While our findings call for both ex-ante and ex-post policy interventions relative to the crisis event, our analysis shows that welfare gains of ex-post policies are much larger than those of ex-ante policies. As a result, adopting only ex ante interventions such as macro-prudential policies or capital controls may be costly in welfare terms. For example, a small macro-prudential tax on debt that lowers the probability of a crisis to zero is welfare-reducing in our model because it also lowers average consumption.","Benigno, Gianluca & Chen, Huigang & Otrok, Christopher & Rebucci, Alessandro & Young, Eric R., 2013.

In a sample of 18/20 developed countries between 1978 and 2009 we find that, in periods without financial crises, increases in bilateral banking linkages are associated with more divergent output cycles. This relation is significantly weaker during financial turmoil periods, suggesting that financial crises induce co-movement among more financially integrated countries. We also show that countries with stronger, direct and indirect, financial ties to the U.S. experienced more synchronized cycles with the U.S. during the recent 2007–2009 crisis. We then interpret these findings using a simple general equilibrium model of international business cycles with banks and shocks to banking activity. The model suggests that the relation between integration and synchronization depends on the type of shocks hitting the world economy, and that shocks to global banks played an important role in triggering and spreading the 2007–2009 crisis.","Kalemli-Ozcan, Sebnem & Papaioannou, Elias & Perri, Fabrizio, 2013.

We argue that political integration with countries that have stronger political and economic institutions leads to growth-enhancing foreign investments because investors expect an improvement of institutions in the future. The empirical evidence supports the importance of political integration: within the group of developing countries, the effect of financial integration is larger in countries that are more strongly politically integrated. Such an effect is not found for advanced countries. Our results suggest that political integration can considerably increase the benefits of financial integration in developing countries, even when institutions are still weak.","Friedrich, Christian & Schnabel, Isabel & Zettelmeyer, Jeromin, 2013.

We embed our transfer analysis in popular models of current account adjustment, where initial imbalances are driven by domestic demand for — or foreign supply of — net saving, possibly associated with over-optimistic expectations. Simulation exercises based on 2006 data suggest that a transfer of the size of the pre-crisis U.S. current account deficit may require only moderate trend depreciation in real terms, and that the aggregate welfare impact of the transfer is disconnected from the size of the relative price correction.","Corsetti, Giancarlo & Martin, Philippe & Pesenti, Paolo, 2013.

The optimal tariff internalizes a mark-up distortion, an entry distortion, and a terms‐of-trade externality. It is larger when the dispersion of firm-level productivities is higher, and the country's relative size or relative average productivity is bigger. Furthermore, in the two-country Nash equilibrium, tariffs turn out to be strategic substitutes. Small or poor economies set lower Nash tariffs than large or rich ones. Lower transportation costs or smaller fixed market entry costs induce higher equilibrium tariffs and larger welfare losses relative to the case of zero tariffs. Similarly, cross-country productivity or size convergence, and higher firm-level productivity dispersion increase the global welfare loss due to non-cooperative tariff policies. These results suggest that post WWII trends have increased the relative merits of the WTO.","Felbermayr, Gabriel & Jung, Benjamin & Larch, Mario, 2013.

Varieties produced at a lower cost (a) are imported at lower absolute demand elasticities and (b) earn higher revenues. By virtue of larger demand elasticities, low revenue varieties benefit the most from tariff liberalization. Further, if varieties are substitutable, low revenue varieties benefit at the expense of high revenue varieties. These predictions are confirmed using a case study of US Uruguay Round ad-valorem tariff cuts, where within exporter-industry groups, low revenue varieties experienced large gains, and high revenue varieties experienced negligible gains. Further, I find evidence suggesting that these effects were also relevant for other trade shocks, such as exchange rates and specific tariffs.","Spearot, Alan C., 2013.

Based on calibration, we find that there would be global under-protection of patent rights when there is no international policy coordination. The empirical fact that firm revenues follow a fat-tailed distribution implies that the barriers to exploit inventions internationally are quite low, despite the fact that only a small fraction of firms sell overseas and an even smaller fraction of firms carry out FDI as a result of trade barriers. Furthermore, requiring all countries to harmonize their patent standards with the equilibrium standard of the most innovative country (the US) does not lead to global over-protection of patent rights.","Lai, Edwin L.-C. & Yan, Isabel K.M., 2013.

We build a model with multiple destination countries and show that immigration policy in one country is influenced by measures adopted abroad as migrants choose where to locate (in part) in response to differences in immigration policy. This interdependence gives rise to a leakage effect of immigration policy, an international externality well documented in the empirical literature. In this environment, immigration policy becomes strategic and unilateral behavior may lead to coordination failures, where receiving countries are stuck in welfare inferior equilibria. We then use an equilibrium refinement to show that the selected equilibrium differs from the Pareto-dominant one and argue that multilateral institutions that help receiving countries make immigration policy commitments would address this inefficiency.","Giordani, Paolo E. & Ruta, Michele, 2013.

We derive a model-based measure of this effect that requires only production and trade data.

First, we formulate and estimate a structural gravity equation based on the standard Krugman model of monopolistic competition and increasing returns. In the context of this model, a key parameter, the elasticity of substitution in consumption (σ), can be estimated precisely – even without observable true ad valorem trade-cost measures – using exporter's population and observable variables that influence trade costs. Second, in the empirical context of the well-known McCallum Canadian–U.S. “border puzzle,” our approach – allowing estimation of σ – yields considerably different general equilibrium comparative static trade-flow and economic welfare effects than those in an Armington endowment economy and assumed values of σ. Moreover, our predicted trade flows and GDPs are highly correlated with their respective observed values in the case of bilaterally symmetric or asymmetric Canadian–U.S. border effects.

Are the decisions of domestic investors to invest abroad or of foreign investors to cut off funds from the domestic economy governed by the same set of determinants? Given the distribution of different types of sudden stop episodes over time and its different macroeconomic consequences, we argue that their determinants may not be alike. One of the novel aspects of this paper is to characterize sudden stops in capital flows (frequency, consequences and determinants) using quarterly data on gross flows for a wide array of countries from 1975 to 2010. We find that foreign investors are less likely to stop bringing capital when the domestic economy is growing and its performance is leveraged by positive external shocks. Domestic agents, on the other hand, are more willing to invest abroad if there are high external savings (current account surpluses), especially in natural-resource abundant countries. Rising financial openness makes the domestic country more vulnerable to sudden stops caused by either local or global investors. Finally, rising risk aversion in world capital markets tend to reduce the likelihood of outflow-driven stops—which may signal a larger propensity towards capital repatriation by domestic investors.","Calderón, César & Kubota, Megumi, 2013.

In the second case, inflation depends on a monetary union decision. Our numerical results show that to have a debt share denominated in a common currency is optimal when the refinancing risks are highly correlated across union members. Otherwise, the best is to keep the domestic debt denominated in local currency. Finally, the extreme case of having all debt issued abroad and denominated in a foreign currency is suitable when, under alternative regimes, suboptimal inflation motivated by political factors is likely.

This is in apparent conflict with neoclassical theory, according to which trade should decrease the relative return on the relatively scarce factor, and thus decrease the skill premium in skill-scarce developing countries. We develop a simple model of trade with talent heterogeneity and capital market imperfections, and show that trade can increase the skill premium in a skill-scarce South that opens up to a skill-abundant North, both in the short run as well as in the long run. We show that trade has two effects: it reduces the skilled wage, and therefore drives non talented agents out of the skilled labor force. It also reduces the cost of subsistence, thereby allowing the talented offspring of unskilled workers to go to school.

For this purpose, we use both industry-level and firm-level imports by country of origin and further distinguish between firm-level offshoring of final versus intermediate goods. Results indicate that China is different from both other low-wage and OECD countries. Industry-level import competition from China reduces firm employment growth and induce skill upgrading in low-tech manufacturing industries. On the other hand, import competition has no effect on firm survival, while offshoring of finished goods to China actually increases firms' probability of survival. In terms of skill upgrading, the effect of Chinese imports is large. Import competition from China accounts for 27% (48%) of the total observed increase – within and between firms – in the share of non-production (highly educated) workers in low-tech Belgian manufacturing over our period of analysis. Offshoring to China further accounts for a small but significant increase in the share of non-production workers.","Mion, Giordano & Zhu, Linke, 2013.

This paper is motivated by recent evidence that trade has greatly expanded on the extensive margin (aka fragmentation, vertical specialization, offshoring) by adding newly traded goods and services and that much of this new trade is in intermediates. I provide an extension of existing gains-from-trade results by allowing trade in an added set of final and/or intermediate goods. As seems generally understood, a sufficient condition for all countries to gain from liberalization is that the relative world prices of initially-traded goods don't change, but I don't think that this has been generalized to expanding the set of tradeables. Further, trade costs break the strict link between domestic and world prices in my approach and this results in interesting subtleties as initially-traded goods change their trade status following fragmentation. I illustrate these results by applying them to two recent and quite specific formulations of expansion at the extensive margin: Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) and Markusen and Venables (2007).","Markusen, James R., 2013.

The GSG hypothesis argues that the surge in capital inflows from emerging market economies to the United States led to significant declines in long-term interest rates in the United States and other industrial economies. In turn, these lower interest rates, when combined with both innovations and deficiencies of the U.S. credit market, are believed to have contributed to the U.S. housing bubble and to the buildup in financial vulnerabilities that led to the financial crisis. Because the GSG countries for the most part restricted their U.S. purchases to Treasuries and Agency debt, their provision of savings to ultimately risky subprime mortgage borrowers was necessarily indirect, pushing down yields on safe assets and increasing the appetite for alternative investments on the part of other investors. Foreign acquisitions of private-label ABS, primarily by Europeans, provided credit more directly and, by adding to domestic demand for these securities, contributed to the decline in their spreads over Treasury yields. Through a combination of empirical estimation and model simulation, we verify that both GSG inflows into Treasuries and Agencies, as well as European acquisitions of ABS, played a role in contributing to downward pressures on U.S. interest rates.","Bertaut, Carol & DeMarco, Laurie Pounder & Kamin, Steven & Tryon, Ralph, 2012.

We identify episodes of “surges” and “stops” (sharp increases and decreases, respectively, of gross inflows) and “flight” and “retrenchment” (sharp increases and decreases, respectively, of gross outflows). Our approach yields fundamentally different results than the previous literature that used measures of net flows. Global factors, especially global risk, are significantly associated with extreme capital flow episodes. Contagion, whether through trade, banking, or geography, is also associated with stop and retrenchment episodes. Domestic macroeconomic characteristics are generally less important, and we find little association between capital controls and the probability of having surges or stops driven by foreign capital flows.

We subsequently examine the contributions of real exchange rates, domestic demand and domestic output to the adjustment process (allowing for differences across exchange rate regimes) and find that external adjustment in deficit countries was achieved primarily through demand compression, rather than expenditure switching. Finally, we show that changes in other investment flows were the main channel of financial account adjustment, with official external assistance and ECB liquidity cushioning the exit of private capital flows for some countries.","Lane, Philip R. & Milesi-Ferretti, Gian Maria, 2012.

I find that recessions and banking crises tend to have negative effects on the formation of new connections and that these effects are not the same for all countries or all banks.

Journal of International Economics,Dollar illiquidity and central bank swap arrangements during the global financial crisis,"['Rose, Andrew K.', 'Spiegel, Mark M.']","While the global financial crisis was centered in the United States, it led to a surprising appreciation in the dollar, suggesting global dollar illiquidity. In response, the Federal Reserve partnered with other central banks to inject dollars into the international financial system. Empirical studies of the success of these efforts have yielded mixed results, in part because their timing is likely to be endogenous. In this paper, we examine the cross-sectional impact of these interventions. Theory consistent with dollar appreciation in the crisis suggests that their impact should be greater for countries that have greater exposure to the United States through trade and financial channels, less transparent holdings of dollar assets, and greater illiquidity difficulties. We examine these predictions for observed cross-sectional changes in CDS spreads, using a new proxy for innovations in perceived changes in sovereign risk based upon Google-search data. We find robust evidence that auctions of dollar assets by foreign central banks disproportionately benefited countries that were more exposed to the United States through either trade linkages or asset exposure. We obtain weaker results for differences in asset transparency or illiquidity. However, several of the important announcements concerning the international swap programs disproportionately benefited countries exhibiting greater asset opaqueness.","Rose, Andrew K. & Spiegel, Mark M., 2012.

Journal of International Economics,"Capital flows, push versus pull factors and the global financial crisis","['Fratzscher, Marcel']","The causes of the 2008 collapse and subsequent surge in global capital flows remain an open and highly controversial issue. Employing a factor model coupled with a dataset of high-frequency portfolio capital flows to 50 economies, the paper finds that common shocks – key crisis events as well as changes to global liquidity and risk – have exerted a large effect on capital flows both in the crisis and in the recovery. However, these effects have been highly heterogeneous across countries, with a large part of this heterogeneity being explained by differences in the quality of domestic institutions, country risk and the strength of domestic macroeconomic fundamentals. Comparing and quantifying these effects show that common factors (“push” factors) were overall the main drivers of capital flows during the crisis, while country-specific determinants (“pull” factors) have been dominant in accounting for the dynamics of global capital flows in 2009 and 2010, in particular for emerging markets.","Fratzscher, Marcel, 2012.

Both investors and managers respond to country returns and crises and adjust their investments substantially, e.g., generating large reallocations during the global financial crisis. Their behavior tends to be pro-cyclical, reducing their exposure to countries during bad times and increasing it when conditions improve. Managers actively change country weights over time, although there is significant short-run pass-through from returns to country weights.

I consider the joint choice of quality and export promotion costs when trade relationships are subject to temporary disputes. When transparency is low and macroeconomic instability is high, disputes arrive more frequently and, therefore, firms may inefficiently choose lower levels of quality and export promotion. These, in turn, build shallower trading relationships with less trade volumes and higher tariffs, and generate greater trade reductions during the more common trade disputes. Several institutional features of the WTO dispute settlement mechanism that are generally lacking in preferential trade agreements such as improved transparency, dispute investigation, and the provision to recommend asymmetric continuation payoffs can ameliorate these inefficient quality choice outcomes. Hence, lower quality output and lower quality trading relationships may be more endemic to countries that depend on preferential trading areas as opposed to the WTO.","Chisik, Richard, 2012.

This identification allows us to measure the distribution wedge associated with bringing traded goods from the point of entry into the United States to their retail outlet. We find that overall U.S. distribution wedges are 50–70%, around 10 to 20 percentage points higher than that reported in the literature. We discuss the implications of this for measuring the size of the “pure” tradeables sector, exchange rate pass-through, and real exchange rate determination. We find that distribution wedges are very stable over time but there is considerable variation across items. There is some variation across the country of origin for the imported item, for our major trading partners, but not as much as the cross-item variation. We also investigate the determinants of distribution wedges, finding that wedges do not vary systematically with exchange rates, but are related to other features of the micro data.","Berger, David & Faust, Jon & Rogers, John H. & Steverson, Kai, 2012.

Up until the recent global financial crisis, these trades generated years of persistent positive returns, which were hard to reconcile with standard pricing kernels. In 2008 these trades blew up, which seemed to weaken the case for a puzzle relating to predictable currency returns. But the rise and fall of this puzzle in the academic literature has only been concerned with naïve carry trades based on yield signals alone.

We examine this fact using Census microdata on plant shipments from the Commodity Flow Survey. We show that the fact is not entirely an international trade phenomenon; part of it can be accounted for by the effect of distance, distinct from any border effect. Export destinations tend to be farther than domestic destinations, and large plants tend to ship farther distances even to domestic locations compared with small plants. We develop an extension of the Melitz (2003) model and use it to set up an analysis with model interpretations of ratios between large plant and small plant shipments that can be calculated with the data. We obtain a decomposition of the overall ratio into a term that varies with distance, holding fixed the border, and a term that varies with the border, holding fixed the distance. The distance term accounts for more than half of the overall difference.","Holmes, Thomas J. & Stevens, John J., 2012.

Journal of International Economics,Decentralized borrowing and centralized default,"['Kim, Yun Jung', 'Zhang, Jing']","In the past, foreign borrowing by developing countries was comprised almost entirely of government borrowing. However, private firms and individuals in developing countries now borrow substantially from foreign lenders. It is often asserted that this surge in private sector borrowing generates excessive borrowing and frequent sovereign defaults in developing countries. This paper analyzes the impact of decentralized borrowing using a quantitative model in which private agents decide how much to borrow and the government decides whether to default. Relative to a model in which the government determines both the level of borrowing and whether to default, decentralized borrowing drives up aggregate credit costs and sovereign default risk, and reduces aggregate welfare. Interestingly, decentralized borrowing may lead to either too much or too little debt in equilibrium depending on the severity of default penalties.","Kim, Yun Jung & Zhang, Jing, 2012.

Our stylized model predicts that the introduction of the euro would lead to an increase in the share of euro-denominated debt and a decline in the share of dollar-denominated debt issued by firms located in countries outside both the United States and the euro area. Moreover, our model predicts that the euro effect would be particularly pronounced for nonfinancial firms. Our empirical results are consistent with these predictions. In addition, we find that among nonfinancial firms, the impact on new issuers is larger than on seasoned issuers. Extending the model to allow for differences in issuance volumes across future monetary union countries prior to integration, we also predict larger increases in euro-denominated issuance among firms from smaller monetary union countries.

Banks can be subject to sectoral and aggregate domestic shocks. After integration they can share these risks in a complete interbank market. When banks have a comparative advantage in providing credit to certain industries, financial integration may induce banks to specialize in lending. An enhanced concentration in lending does not necessarily increase risk, because a well-functioning interbank market allows to achieve the necessary diversification. This greater need for risk sharing, though, increases the risk of cross-border contagion and the likelihood of widespread banking crises. However, even though integration increases the risk of contagion it improves welfare if it permits banks to realize specialization benefits.","Fecht, Falko & Grüner, Hans Peter & Hartmann, Philipp, 2012.

Journal of International Economics,Corporate taxation and the choice of patent location within multinational firms,"['Karkinsky, Tom', 'Riedel, Nadine']","Corporate patents are important assets in the modern economy, where knowledge is highly valued. In many multinational enterprises (MNEs), they constitute a major portion of the business's value. The intra-firm transfer pricing process for patent-related royalty payments is moreover often highly intransparent and patents thus represent a major source of profit shifting opportunities between multinational entities. For both reasons, MNEs have an incentive to locate their patents at low-tax affiliates to minimize the corporate tax burden. The purpose of our paper is to empirically test for this relationship by exploiting a unique dataset that links information on patent applications to micro panel data for European MNEs. Our results suggest that the corporate tax rate (differential to other group members) exerts a negative effect on the number of patent applications filed by a multinational affiliate. The effect is quantitatively large and robust to controlling for firm size and unobserved heterogeneity between the entities. The findings moreover prevail if we account for royalty withholding taxes and binding ‘Controlled Foreign Company’ rules.","Karkinsky, Tom & Riedel, Nadine, 2012.

Journal of International Economics,Can leading indicators assess country vulnerability? Evidence from the 2008–09 global financial crisis,"['Frankel, Jeffrey', 'Saravelos, George']","We investigate whether leading indicators can help explain the cross-country incidence of the 2008–09 financial crisis. Rather than looking for indicators with specific relevance to the recent crisis, the selection of variables is driven by an extensive review of more than eighty papers from the previous literature on early warning indicators. Our motivation is to address suspicions that indicators found to be useful predictors in one round of crises are typically not useful to predict the next round. The review suggests that central bank reserves and past movements in the real exchange rate were the two leading indicators that had proven the most useful in explaining crisis incidence across different countries and episodes in the past. For the 2008–09 crisis, we use six different variables to measure crisis incidence: drops in GDP and industrial production, currency depreciation, stock market performance, reserve losses, and participation in an IMF program. We find that the level of reserves in 2007 appears as a consistent and statistically significant leading indicator of who got hit by the 2008–09 crisis, in line with the conclusions of the pre-2008 literature. In addition to reserves, recent real appreciation is a statistically significant predictor of devaluation and of a measure of exchange market pressure during the current crisis. We define the period of the global financial shock as running from late 2008 to early 2009, which probably explains why we find stronger results than earlier papers such as Obstfeld et al. (2009, 2010) and Rose and Spiegel (2009a,b, 2010, 2011) which use annual data.","Frankel, Jeffrey & Saravelos, George, 2012. ""Can leading indicators assess country vulnerability?

In particular, the model shows that countries with more protective labor laws export relatively more in firm-specific skill-intensive sectors at both the intensive and extensive margins.

We find that larger stocks of emigrants in a given destination increase export participation and intensity. In addition, we show that the former of these effects tends to be more pronounced among firms that are more likely to have close ties with the emigrants.

The model is used to re-examine the relationship between the innovation in the North and the imitation lag of the South and to address the implications of the (weak) international Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection. When the imitation technology is modeled as a function of increasing complexity of targeted products, opening to trade increases the growth rate and welfare of both regions, but results in a larger North–South quality gap. While a full catch-up is possible with no protection of ideas flow, but also with no trade, the quality gap is always positive under full economic integration including trade in goods.

Journal of International Economics,"Trade, competition, and efficiency","['Behrens, Kristian', 'Murata, Yasusada']","We present a general equilibrium model of monopolistic competition featuring pro-competitive effects and a competitive limit, and investigate the impact of trade on welfare and efficiency. Contrary to the constant elasticity case, in which all gains from trade are due to product diversity, our model allows for a welfare decomposition between gains from product diversity and gains from pro-competitive effects. We show that the market outcome is not efficient because too many firms operate at an inefficiently small scale by charging too high markups. We further illustrate that trade raises efficiency by narrowing the gap between the equilibrium utility and the optimal utility. As the population gets arbitrarily large in the integrated economy, the equilibrium utility converges to the optimal utility because of the competitive limit. We finally extend the variable elasticity model to a multi-sector setting, and show that intersectoral distortions are eliminated in the limit. The multi-sector model allows us to illustrate some new aspects arising from intersectoral and intrasectoral allocations, namely that trade leads to structural convergence, rather than sectoral specialization, and that trade induces domestic exit in the nontraded sector.","Behrens, Kristian & Murata, Yasusada, 2012.

The data show that sectors characterized by a higher degree of competition tend to lobby more together (through a sector-wide trade association), while sectors with higher concentration and more differentiated products lobby more individually. The paper proposes a theoretical model to interpret the empirical evidence. In an oligopolistic market, firms can benefit from an increase in their product-specific protection measure, if they can raise prices and profits. They find it less profitable to do so in a competitive market where attempts to raise prices are more likely to reduce profits. In competitive markets firms are therefore more likely to lobby together, thereby simultaneously raising tariffs on all products in the sector.","Bombardini, Matilde & Trebbi, Francesco, 2012.

Journal of International Economics,"Heterogeneous firms, exporter networks and the effect of distance on international trade","['Krautheim, Sebastian']","Distance effects in gravity equations are high and are not decreasing over time. Given that technical change in transport technology is biased in favor of long distances, this constitutes a challenge for existing theoretical models. In line with recent empirical evidence, this paper introduces a spillover effect from the number of exporters to the fixed costs of exporting into a trade model with heterogeneous firms. Since less firms export to remote markets, the equilibrium fixed costs are increasing in distance. This creates an additional effect of distance on aggregate trade flows: while the intensive margin of trade is unaffected, the extensive margin is magnified. This magnification leads to higher predicted distance effects. In addition, it offers a new perspective on non-decreasing distance effects: a relatively moderate strengthening of the spillover over time is sufficient to generate a constant distance elasticity.","Krautheim, Sebastian, 2012.

Journal of International Economics,Capital liberalization and the US external imbalance,"['Prades, Elvira', 'Rabitsch, Katrin']","Differences in financial systems are often named as a prime candidate for the current state of global imbalances. This paper focuses on cross-country heterogeneity in access to international financial markets that derives from the presence of capital controls and argues that the process of capital liberalization over the past decades can explain a substantial fraction of US net external liabilities. We present a simple two-country model with an internationally traded bond, in which capital controls are reflected in the presence of borrowing and lending constraints on that bond. In a US versus the rest of the world (RoW) scenario, we perform experiments that are largely consistent with countries' liberalization experiences. A reduction in the RoW's controls on capital outflows and/or a tightening in the RoW's borrowing constraint enable the US economy to better insure against consumption risk relative to the rest of the world, and therefore decrease its motives for precautionary asset holdings relative to the rest of the world. As a result of these asymmetric shifts in countries' barriers to capital mobility, the US runs a long run external deficit.","Prades, Elvira & Rabitsch, Katrin, 2012.

We analyse a large panel of 52 currencies in advanced and emerging countries over almost 25years of data. We find that only a few factors are robustly associated to a safe haven status, most notably the net foreign asset position, an indicator of external vulnerability, and whether currencies have been a good hedge in the past. In addition, the currencies of large, less financially open economies are a good hedge against global risk aversion shocks. By contrast, the level of the interest rate spread vs. the US is significant only during the latest crisis.

We hypothesize that investors can appeal to a firm's internal (firm-level) and external (country-level) corporate governance to draw inferences on a firm's motive behind the use of derivatives, since well-governed firms are more likely to use derivatives to hedge rather than to speculate or pursue managers' self-interest.

New exporters enter large countries and destinations with characteristics similar to their domestic market. Less similar, distant or less developed countries are entered by firms already exporting to other destinations. I formulate a dynamic general equilibrium model to test if these patterns are due to firms learning how to export (as other recent empirical findings have suggested) or other factors considered in the literature. In this model, heterogeneous firms experience learning in the form of market entry costs that depend on export history. Using Russian firm level data, I find that learning plays a significant role in explaining the observed entry patterns, which standard trade models cannot account for.","Schmeiser, Katherine N., 2012.

In this framework, knowing the bilateral details of each country's input–output structure is key to the correct calculation of the factor content of trade. Because input–output tables typically lack this detail, TZ impute the relevant input–output coefficients by making a proportionality assumption. This paper uses survey-based input–output coefficients from the Asian Input–output (AIO) tables that do provide bilateral details. Exploiting methodological differences in the compilation of the AIO tables and the data underlying TZ studies, this paper empirically assesses how well the TZ approach fits sourcing patterns of inputs and finds that it understates countries' use and relative use of foreign inputs, especially in those sectors where they are most used. As a result countries' use of domestic factors is overstated. Biases generated on exported and imported factor services cancel each other out.

We show that credit conditions were an important channel through which the crisis affected trade volumes, by exploiting the variation in the cost of capital across countries and over time, as well as the variation in financial vulnerability across sectors. Countries with higher interbank rates and thus tighter credit markets exported less to the US during the peak of the crisis. This effect was especially pronounced in sectors that require extensive external financing, have limited access to trade credit, or have few collateralizable assets. Exports of financially vulnerable industries were thus more sensitive to the cost of external capital than exports of less vulnerable industries, and this sensitivity rose during the financial crisis. The quantitative implications of our estimates for trade volumes highlight the large real effects of financial crises and the potential gains from policy intervention.","Chor, Davin & Manova, Kalina, 2012.

This paper uses a unique dataset of French firms to match export data to firm-level credit constraints and shows that most of the 2008–2009 trade collapse was due to the unprecedented demand shock and to product characteristics. While all firms have been affected by the crisis, the effect on large firms has been mainly at the intensive margin and has resulted in a smaller portfolio of products being offered to export destinations. The effect on smaller exporters has been to reduce the range of destinations served or to stop exporting altogether. Credit constraints have been an added aggravation for firms active in high financial dependence sectors. However, the share of credit constrained firms is small and their number has not increased hugely during the crisis, with the result that the overall impact of credit constraints on trade has been limited.","Bricongne, Jean-Charles & Fontagné, Lionel & Gaulier, Guillaume & Taglioni, Daria & Vicard, Vincent, 2012.

There is rent sharing at the firm level due to fair wage preferences of workers, and hence firms with higher profits pay higher wages in equilibrium in order to elicit their workers' full effort. We show that in this framework international trade leads to a self-selection of the best firms into export status, with exporting firms having to pay a wage premium.

In our model, managers decide whether or not to integrate their firms, trading off the pecuniary benefits of coordinating production decisions with the private benefits of operating in their preferred ways. The price of output is a crucial determinant of this choice, since it affects the size of the pecuniary benefits. Organizational choices also depend on the terms of trade in supplier markets, which affect the division of surplus between managers. We show that, even when firms do not relocate across countries, the price changes triggered by the liberalization of product markets can lead to changes in ownership structures within countries. The removal of barriers to factor mobility can also induce widespread restructuring, which can lead to increases in product prices (or declines in quality), hurting consumers worldwide.","Conconi, Paola & Legros, Patrick & Newman, Andrew F., 2012.

Across sectors, the VAX ratio for Manufactures is low relative to Services, primarily because Services are used as an intermediate to produce manufacturing exports. Across bilateral partners, VAX ratios vary widely and contain information on both bilateral and triangular production chains. We document specifically that bilateral production linkages, not variation in the composition of exports, drive variation in bilateral VAX ratios.

Journal of International Economics,The role of expenditure switching in the global imbalance adjustment,"['Dong, Wei']","In theory, nominal exchange rate movements can lead to “expenditure switching” when they generate changes in the relative prices of goods across countries. This paper explores whether the expenditure-switching role of exchange rates has changed in the current episode of significant global imbalances. We develop a multi-sector two-country model for the United States and the G6 countries, with the rest of the world captured by exogenous price and demand shocks, and estimate the model over two sub-samples, which cover the periods before and after the early 1990s. Our results indicate that both U.S. imports and exports have become much less responsive to exchange rate movements in recent years, mainly due to changes in firms' pricing behavior and global trade pattern. These findings suggest that the exchange rate would have to move by a much larger amount now than in the 1970s and 1980s to reduce the U.S. trade deficit by a given amount.","Dong, Wei, 2012.

Journal of International Economics,Duration of sovereign debt renegotiation,"['Bai, Yan', 'Zhang, Jing']","In the period since 1990, sovereign debt renegotiations take an average of five years for bank loans but only one year for bonds. We provide an explanation for this finding by highlighting one key difference between bank loans and bonds: bank loans are rarely traded, while bonds are heavily traded on the secondary market. In our theory, the secondary market plays a crucial information revelation role in shortening renegotiations. Consider a dynamic bargaining game with incomplete information between a government and creditors. The creditors' reservation value is private information, and the government knows only its distribution. Delays in reaching agreements arise in equilibrium because the government uses costly delays to screen the creditors' reservation value. When the creditors trade on the secondary market, the market price conveys information about their reservation value, which lessens the information friction and reduces the renegotiation duration. We find that the secondary market tends to increase the renegotiation payoff of the government but decrease that of the creditors while increasing the total payoff. We then embed these renegotiation outcomes in a simple sovereign debt model to analyze the ex ante welfare implications. The secondary market has the potential to increase the government ex ante welfare when the information friction is severe.","Bai, Yan & Zhang, Jing, 2012.

Using a gravity equation approach, we analyze how the decrease in tariffs promoted during the 90s by the Uruguay Round multilateral trade agreement affected the trade margins of French firms for 57 sectors and 147 countries from 1993 to 2002. Our main contribution is to estimate the elasticity of trade on both margins, controlling for the unobserved heterogeneity of trade flows thanks to a three-dimensional panel and to time-varying tariffs as a measure of variable trade costs. Our results show that the number of firms exporting in a given sector to a given destination is related to the level of tariffs. But they also show that the decrease in tariffs induced by the implementation of the Uruguay Round did not lead more firms to export and that it only induced incumbent exporters to increase their shipments. We control for two problems that may affect our basic specification: tariff changes may be endogenous and zero flows are not included. Our results are confirmed — even when the extensive margin is significant, its magnitude is very small.","Buono, Ines & Lalanne, Guy, 2012.

Furthermore, poorer countries do not just trade less, but have a lower number of trading partners.

The key element of the model is an association between trade costs (both variable and fixed) and countries' development levels, which can account for the effect of per capita income on trade volumes and explain many zeros in bilateral trade flows. I find that market access costs play an important role in fitting the model to the data.

We show that the sequential nature of the process is harmful and more costly than a “big bang” multilateral agreement. The sequentiality may even prevent the process from being completed successfully. Closing down a subset of tax havens reduces competition among the havens that remain active. This makes their “tax haven business” more profitable and shifts a larger share of rents to these remaining tax havens, making them more reluctant to give up their “tax haven business”.

Journal of International Economics,Demand uncertainty: Exporting delays and exporting failures,"['Nguyen, Daniel X.']","This paper presents a model of trade that explains why firms wait to export and why many exporters fail. Firms face uncertain demands that are only realized after the firm enters the destination. The model retools the timing of the resolution of uncertainty found in models with heterogeneity of firm productivity. This retooling addresses several shortcomings. First, the imperfect correlation of demands reconciles the sales variation observed in and across destinations. Second, since demands for the firm's output are correlated across destinations, a firm can use previously realized demands to forecast unknown demands in untested destinations. The option to forecast demands causes firms to delay exporting in order to gather more information about foreign demand. Third, since uncertainty is resolved after entry, many firms enter a destination and then exit after learning that they cannot profit. This prediction reconciles the high rate of exit seen in the first years of exporting. Finally, when faced with multiple destinations to which they can export, many firms will choose to sequentially export in order to slowly learn more about its chances for success in untested markets.","Nguyen, Daniel X., 2012.

In the model, financial intermediaries (FIs) enter into chained credit contracts at home and abroad, engaging in cross-border lending to entrepreneurs by undertaking cross-border borrowing from investors. The FIs as well as the entrepreneurs in two countries are credit constrained, so all of their net worths matter. Our model reveals that under FIs' globalization, adverse shocks that hit one country affect the other, yielding business cycle synchronization on both the real and financial sides. It also suggests that the FIs' globalization, net worth shock, and credit constraints are key to understanding the recent financial crisis.","Ueda, Kozo, 2012.

There is little evidence, however, that countries have increased risk sharing despite widespread financial liberalization.

When countries remove official capital controls, default risk is still present as an implicit barrier to capital flows. If default risk were eliminated, capital flows would be six times greater, and international risk sharing would increase substantially.","Bai, Yan & Zhang, Jing, 2012.

Decomposing the volatility of sales of exporters between their domestic and export markets, I show using an identification strategy based on a firm-specific geographical instrument that firms with a larger export share have more volatile domestic sales and less volatile exports. These empirical patterns can be explained using a model in which firms face market-specific shocks and short-run convex costs of production. In such a framework, firms react to a shock in one market by adjusting their sales in the other market. I point to strong evidence that output variations on the domestic and export market are negatively correlated at the firm level. This result casts doubts on the standard hypothesis that firms face constant marginal costs and maximize profits on their different markets independently of each other.

If the ‘border regions’ are defined narrowly, within a band of less than 50km, we can identify statistically significant liberalization effects on both employment and wages. While wages responded earlier than employment, the employment effect over the entire adjustment period is estimated to be around three times as large as the wage effect.

Unlike previous studies, we are able to examine all three channels. Both net exporters and import-competing firms were exposed to increased competition due to the real appreciation. Both groups reacted by shedding labor, but only the first group experienced increasing labor productivity.

In the simulated model, falling trade costs explain much of the observed growth in overall and VS trade. Manufacturing trade grows twice as fast as overall trade. Raw materials trade was more important in the 1960s when trade costs were high, since their production is more strongly linked to endowments than manufacturing. Therefore, materials will be traded even when trade costs are high.

In this paper, we focus on China's direct exports to the United States.

The value of VAT avoided is estimated at $6.5 billion during 2002–2008, and the associated understatements account for approximately two-thirds of the discrepancy. We also provide evidence of tariff evasion at the U.S. border, in particular for related-party transactions, and indirect evidence of transfer pricing and evasion of Chinese capital controls. An estimated $2 billion of U.S. tariff revenue is lost due to such evasion during 2002–2008, which reduces the apparent size of the statistical discrepancy.","Ferrantino, Michael J. & Liu, Xuepeng & Wang, Zhi, 2012.

Journal of International Economics,Volatility due to offshoring: Theory and evidence,"['Bergin, Paul R.', 'Feenstra, Robert C.', 'Hanson, Gordon H.']","Existing models of offshoring are not equipped to explain how global production sharing affects the volatility of economic activity. This paper develops a trade model that can account for why offshoring industries in low wage countries such as Mexico experience fluctuations in employment that are twice as large as in high wage countries such as the United States. We argue that a key to explaining this outcome is that the extensive margin of offshoring responds endogenously to shocks in demand and transmits those shocks across borders in an amplified manner. Empirical evidence supports the claim that the extensive margin of offshoring is an active margin of adjustment, and quantitative simulation experiments show that the degree of movement of this margin in the data is sufficient to explain relative employment volatility in Mexico and the U.S.","Bergin, Paul R. & Feenstra, Robert C. & Hanson, Gordon H., 2011.

Journal of International Economics,Policy choice: Theory and evidence from commitment via international trade agreements,"['Limão, Nuno', 'Tovar, Patricia']","Why do governments employ inefficient policies when more efficient ones are available for the same purpose? We address this puzzle in the context of redistribution toward special interest groups (SIGs) by focusing on a set of important policies: tariffs and non-tariff barriers (NTBs). In our policy choice model a government can gain by committing to constrain tariffs through international agreements even if this leads to the use of less efficient NTBs; commitment has political value because it improves the bargaining position of a government that is weak relative to domestic SIGs. Using detailed data we find support for several of the model's predictions including: (i) tariff commitments in trade agreements increase the likelihood and restrictiveness of NTBs but not enough to offset the original tariff reductions; (ii) tariff commitments are more likely to be adopted and more stringent when the government is weaker relative to a SIG. Thus, the results can explain the use of inefficient policies for redistribution and suggest that the bargaining motive is an important source of the political value of commitment in international agreements.","Limão, Nuno & Tovar, Patricia, 2011.

Using a dataset that includes the full population of U.S. manufacturing plants, I show that an apparent positive correlation between antidumping duties and traditional revenue productivity is likely misleading. For the subset of plants reporting quantity-based output data, increases in prices and markups artificially inflate the effect of antidumping duties on revenue productivity, while physical productivity actually falls. Moreover, antidumping duties allow low-productivity plants to continue producing protected products, slowing the reallocation of resources from less productive to more productive uses.","Pierce, Justin R., 2011.

Yet results vary broadly across methods and countries. To examine these vertical spillovers in a systematic way, we collected 3626 estimates of spillovers and reviewed the literature quantitatively. Our meta-analysis indicates that model misspecifications reduce the reported estimates and journals select relatively large estimates for publication. No selection, however, was found for working papers. Taking these biases into consideration, the average spillover to suppliers is economically significant, whereas the spillover to buyers is statistically significant but small. Greater spillovers are received by countries that have underdeveloped financial systems and are open to international trade. Greater spillovers are generated by investors who come from distant countries and have only a slight technological edge over local firms.","Havranek, Tomas & Irsova, Zuzana, 2011.

This paper shows that whether valuation effects are stabilizing or not depends critically on the nature of the underlying productivity shocks. In response to transitory shocks, valuation effects are stabilizing; but in response to trend shocks, such effects amplify the impact of the current account on NFA position. These contrasting effects arise because optimally smoothing consumers respond differently to a transitory shock than to a trend shock to income. This theoretical result finds empirical support with G7 countries' data, and is illustrated by the pattern of external imbalances between the U.S. and other G7 countries since the 1990s.","Nguyen, Ha, 2011.

This observation has recently led support to the view that, in these economies, the long-end of the yield curve has decoupled from its short-end and naturally to a concern that monetary policy may have lost some of its autonomy. We set up and estimate a two-country small open economy model in which the expectations hypothesis and uncovered interest rate parity hold to study the co-movement of long-term nominal interest rates of different currencies.

Journal of International Economics,"Transportation, freight rates, and economic geography","['Behrens, Kristian', 'Picard, Pierre M.']","We investigate the role of competitive transport markets in shaping the location of economic activity and the pattern of trade. In our model, carriers supply transport services for shipping manufactured goods, and freight rates are set to clear transport markets. Each carrier must commit to the maximum capacity for a round-trip and thus faces a logistics problem as there are opportunity costs of returning empty. These costs increase the freight rates charged to firms located in regions that are net exporters of manufactured goods. Since demand for transport services depends on the spatial distribution of economic activity, the concentration of production in one region raises freight rates to serve foreign markets from there, thus working against specialization and the agglomeration of firms. Consequently, a more even spatial distribution of firms and production prevails at equilibrium when freight rates are endogenously determined than when they are assumed to be exogenous as in the literature.","Behrens, Kristian & Picard, Pierre M., 2011.

Using a unique dataset of firm-level surveys that are representative of the entire Indian manufacturing industry, I show that India's unilateral reduction in final goods tariffs increased the average productivity of small, informal firms, which account for 80% of Indian manufacturing employment but have been excluded from previous studies. In contrast, the increase in productivity among larger, formal firms was driven primarily by the concurrent reduction in input tariffs. By examining the effect of the tariff liberalization on the distributions of productivity and firm size, I find evidence consistent with the exit of the smallest, least productive firms from the informal sector. In addition, I find that although the decline in final goods tariffs did not significantly impact average formal sector productivity, it did increase productivity among the top quantiles of the distribution.","Nataraj, Shanthi, 2011.

The case of Mexico between 1988 and 2002 is representative of several episodes in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe in which countries opening to capital flows experienced large appreciations accompanied by a significant reallocation of workers towards the non-tradable sector. We account for these facts using a two sector dynamic general equilibrium model of a small open economy with frictions to labor reallocation and two driving forces: (i) A decline in the cost of borrowing in foreign markets, and (ii) differential productivity growth across sectors. These two mechanisms account together for 60% of the decline in the domestic relative price of tradables in Mexico and for a large fraction of the observed reallocation of labor across sectors. The decline in the interest rate faced by Mexico in international markets is quantitatively the most important channel.

With an endogenous defence, actions of speculators may become strategic substitutes instead of the usual complements.

This paper studies whether this difference in investors' home countries affects their portfolio choice in an emerging market. It combines two unique data sets on ownership and control in business groups, and investor-stock level foreign investment in Korea. A key finding is that investors from low-disparity countries disfavor high-disparity stocks in Korea, but investors from high-disparity countries are indifferent. Moreover, investors from low-disparity countries became averse to disparity only after the Asian financial crisis. These results suggest that the nature of corporate governance in international investors' home countries affects their portfolio choice abroad, and therefore these investors should not be lumped together in the analyses of their portfolio choice.","Kim, Woochan & Sung, Taeyoon & Wei, Shang-Jin, 2011.

We use a dataset of French firms to demonstrate that this prediction is strongly supported by the data, both for the economy as a whole and at the industry level. Furthermore, the differences between power law coefficients for exporters and non-exporters are larger in sectors that are more open to trade.

The 2001 U.S.âVietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) provides an excellent opportunity to examine this question as, unlike other bilateral trade agreements, the U.S. tariff cuts were not influenced by Vietnamese industries. Using variation in the structure of the labor force across provinces prior to the trade agreement, I construct provincial measures of U.S. tariffs. To address concerns over confounding trends between changes in provincial poverty and changes in provincial tariffs I follow two approaches: controlling for trends based on observable initial conditions and differencing away time invariant trends using pre-BTA data. I find that provinces that were more exposed to the U.S. tariff cuts experienced faster decreases in poverty between 2002 and 2004. Additionally, I document that the movement of workers across provinces is limited in scale, particularly for those with low levels of education. Finally, I show that the most exposed provinces experienced faster wage growth for workers with low levels of education, but not for highly educated workers.","Brian, McCaig, 2011.

This study examines the link between services sector reforms and the productivity of manufacturing industries relying on services inputs. Several aspects of services liberalization are considered, namely, the presence of foreign providers, privatization and the level of competition. The results, based on firm-level data from the Czech Republic, show a positive relationship between services sector reform and the performance of domestic firms in downstream manufacturing sectors. Allowing foreign entry into services industries appears to be the key channel through which services liberalization contributes to improved performance of manufacturing sectors. This finding is supported by evidence that foreign acquisitions of Czech services providers result in profound changes in the labor productivity and sales of acquired firms. As most barriers to foreign investment today are not in goods but in services sectors, the findings of this study may strengthen the argument for reform in this area.","Arnold, Jens M. & Javorcik, Beata S. & Mattoo, Aaditya, 2011.

If a firm in the developed country outsources the production of its intermediate goods to a supplier in the developing country, it faces an adverse selection problem.

My analysis of this tradeoff provides a new explanation for the observation that FDI is concentrated in capital intensive industries and yields two empirical hypotheses: more firms should adopt outsourcing instead of FDI after trade liberalization; the share of intra-firm trade in total trade should be increasing in the degree of productivity dispersion across intermediate goods suppliers in the developing country.","Cheng, Chen, 2011.

How are trade policies and the viability of trade agreements affected? What are the welfare implications of such foreign influence? In this paper we develop a model of foreign influence and apply it to the study of optimal tariffs. In a two-country voting model of electoral competition, we allow the incumbent party in each country to take costly actions that probabilistically affect the electoral outcome in the other country. We show that policies end up maximizing a weighted sum of domestic and foreign welfare. Using this formulation we show that foreign influence increases aggregate world welfare when there are no other means of alleviating the externalities that arise from cross-border effects of policies. In contrast, when countries can engage in international agreements, foreign influence can prove harmful as powerful countries may refuse to offer concessions. We also show that power imbalances are particularly detrimental to cooperation when they are positively correlated with economic size.","Antràs, Pol & Padró i Miquel, Gerard, 2011.

If the excess demand for the foreign traded good is increasing in the good's own price in a given steady state, the equilibrium dynamics around this steady state are unbounded.

For economies with high-quality institutions (defined by the competitiveness of the financial sector, the quality of corporate governance, and the level of property rights protection), finance is passive. On the other hand, for economies with low-quality institutions, the quality of the financial system is an independent source of comparative advantage. Interestingly, the conventional measure of financial development (the size of the financial market relative to GDP) does not adequately capture the underlying quality of financial institutions. In addition, free trade may reduce the aggregate income in South. Financial capital tends to flow from South to North.","Ju, Jiandong & Wei, Shang-Jin, 2011.

We also provide detailed evidence on the trading patterns of service exporters and importers, such as the number of markets served, the value of exports and imports per market and the share of individual markets in overall sales. We interpret these facts in the light of existing theories of international trade in services and goods. Our results demonstrate that firm-level heterogeneity is a key feature of services trade.

This paper provides novel evidence for the importance of in-person business meetings in international trade. Interactions among trade partners entail a fixed cost of trade, but at the same time they generate relationship capital, which adds bilateral specific value to the traded products. Differences in the face-to-face communication intensity of traded goods, bilateral travel costs and foreign market size determine the optimal amount of interaction between trade partners. Using U.S. state level data on international business-class air travel as a measure of in-person business meetings, I find robust evidence that the demand for business-class air travel is directly related to volume and composition of exports in differentiated products. I also find that trade flows in R&D intensive manufactures and goods facing contractual frictions are most dependent on face-to-face meetings. The econometric identification exploits the cross-state variation in bilateral exports and business-class air travelers by foreign country and time period, circumventing any spurious correlation induced by cross-country differences driving aggregate travel and trade patterns.","Cristea, Anca D., 2011.

Journal of International Economics,Rethinking the area approach: Immigrants and the labor market in California,"['Peri, Giovanni']","A framework that uses a Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function with skill differentiation and integrated national labor markets has predictions for the employment effect of immigrants at the local level. The employment (rather than wage) response to immigration by skill in a state reveals the production substitutability-complementarity between native and immigrant labor. This, in turn, reveals the degree to which immigrants stimulate or depress the demand for native labor. To estimate this elasticity, I use a novel instrument based on demographic characteristics of total Central American migrants or of the Mexican Population to predict immigration by skill level within California. Looking at immigration to California between 1960 and 2005 these estimates support the assumption of a nationally integrated labor market by skill and they support the hypothesis that natives and immigrants in the same education-experience group are not perfectly substitutable. This explains the counter-intuitive fact that there is a zero correlation between immigration and wage and employment outcomes of natives in the state.","Peri, Giovanni, 2011.

Despite a natural association with concepts of life cycles, industrial policy has not been analyzed in the context of an industry life-cycle model. In particular, an important life-cycle characteristic, the potential for very large changes in the rate of net entry, is ignored. In this paper, we demonstrate how the impact of industrial policy depends critically on the entry and exit dynamics within an industry. We construct a model of technology adoption in which the number of firms is endogenous, and derive a set of novel predictions about the effects of protection on firm technology decisions. Specifically, we show that permanent protection can induce earlier adoption, but also decreases the probability that a given firm adopts the new technology. Likewise, we demonstrate that reducing the duration of protection results in faster adoption than permanent protection, but also reduces a given firm's probability of adoption. Finally, we show that, for industries characterized by flexibility in firm numbers, protection does not change the rate of technology adoption but does increase the size and probability of a shakeout (large scale net exit).","Ederington, Josh & McCalman, Phillip, 2011.

In this context, external debt emerges even in the absence of classic penalties, and government default is countercyclical, triggers a liquidity crunch, and amplifies output volatility.

Journal of International Economics,Structural estimation and solution of international trade models with heterogeneous firms,"['Balistreri, Edward J.', 'Hillberry, Russell H.', 'Rutherford, Thomas F.']","We present an empirical implementation of a general-equilibrium model of international trade with heterogeneous manufacturing firms. The theory underlying our model is consistent with Melitz (2003). A nonlinear structural estimation procedure identifies a set of core parameters and unobserved firm-level trade frictions that best fit the geographic pattern of trade. Our estimation model is consistent with the specified general equilibrium model, and we conduct general equilibrium counterfactual analyses to illustrate model responses. We first assess the economic effects of reductions in measured tariffs. Taking the simple-average welfare change across regions the Melitz structure indicates welfare gains from liberalization that are four times larger than in a standard trade policy simulation. Furthermore, when we compare the economic impact of tariff reductions with reductions in estimated fixed trade costs we find that policy measures affecting the fixed costs are of greater importance than tariff barriers.","Balistreri, Edward J. & Hillberry, Russell H. & Rutherford, Thomas F., 2011.

Journal of International Economics,Credit constraints and firm export: Microeconomic evidence from Italy,"['Minetti, Raoul', 'Zhu, Susan Chun']","This paper estimates the impact of credit rationing on firms' export. We use detailed survey data from Italian manufacturing firms that provide a firm-specific measure of credit rationing based directly on firms' responses to the survey rather than indirectly on firms' financial statements. After controlling for productivity and other relevant firm attributes, and accounting for the endogeneity of credit rationing, we find that the probability of exporting is 39% lower for rationed firms and that rationing reduces foreign sales by more than 38%. While credit rationing also appears to depress domestic sales, its impact on foreign sales is significantly stronger. The analysis also suggests that credit rationing is an obstacle to export especially for firms operating in high-tech industries and in industries that heavily rely on external finance.","Minetti, Raoul & Zhu, Susan Chun, 2011.

Journal of International Economics,Lobbying costs and trade policy,"['Tovar, Patricia']","We study how endogenous lobbying costs influence trade policies. Although in practice lobbying expenditures far exceed campaign contributions, the literature on the political economy of trade policy has focused on the latter. In this paper we develop a model in which informational lobbying costs play a role in determining the structure of protection. In the model, special interest groups can choose to send a signal to the policymaker regarding some information they possess, and the policymaker observes the signal before setting the trade policies. We find that lobbying expenditures directly affect the equilibrium policies. In order to test the predictions of the model we collected data on lobbying expenditures from the Center for Responsible Politics as well as data on trade and industry characteristic variables for the United States from other sources. We perform a structural estimation of the equilibrium trade policies and find support for our model. The empirical evidence indicates that lobbying expenditures play an important role in explaining the variation of protection across sectors. Moreover, the model leads to considerably lower and more reasonable estimates of the weight that the government places on social welfare relative to political contributions.","Tovar, Patricia, 2011.

Journal of International Economics,"In search of WTO trade effects: Preferential trade agreements promote trade strongly, but unevenly","['Eicher, Theo S.', 'Henn, Christian']","The literature measuring the effects of WTO membership on trade flows has produced remarkably diverse results. Rose (2004) reports a wide range of empirical specifications that produce no WTO effects. Tomz et al. (2007) use Rose's data but include de facto WTO membership, to find positive WTO trade effects. Rose (2005) also produced positive WTO trade effects after accounting for the diverse trade effects produced by individual preferential trade agreements (PTAs). When Subramanian and Wei (2007) emphasize general equilibrium trade effects by controlling for multilateral resistance, they find strong WTO trade effects only for industrialized countries. Subramanian and Wei (2007), however, account neither for unobserved heterogeneity among trading partners, nor for differences in trade effects across PTAs (which could inflate WTO estimates). We unify the Rose, Tomz et al., and Subramanian and Wei specifications in one comprehensive approach that minimizes omitted variable bias to show that all specifications produce one consistent result: WTO effects on trade flows are not statistically significant, while PTAs produce strong but uneven trade effects. Extending the gravity model to address specific avenues in which WTO may have affected trade flows, we find that WTO membership boosts trade prior to PTA formation and increases trade among proximate developing countries (at the expense of distant trade). An augmented gravity model that accounts for WTO terms-of-trade theory shows that countries with greater incentives to bargain for tariff reductions before WTO accession experience positive and significant subsequent WTO trade effects.","Eicher, Theo S. & Henn, Christian, 2011.

In this paper, we combine the stabilization and credibility branches of the currency union literature and construct a simple welfare criterion that can be used to evaluate alternative monetary arrangements.

In this paper, I study the theoretical response of wage ratios to skill-biased technical change and trade integration. I build a simple model of heterogeneous technology and heterogeneous workers that features complementarities between the quality of ideas and abilities. I show that changes to the skill bias of technology and to trade costs can both reproduce the observed pattern since (i) they have similar asymmetric effects on productive vs. unproductive firms, and (ii) positive assortative matching in the labor market transmits this asymmetry across high and low skill workers. Focusing on the different channels through which skill-biased technical change and trade integration operate suggests ways to disentangle the magnitude of each.","Monte, Ferdinando, 2011.

Journal of International Economics,The effect of investor origin on firm performance: Domestic and foreign direct investment in the United States,"['Chen, Wenjie']","This paper evaluates the causal relationship between the source of origin of FDI and the performance of the target firm. The empirical analysis uses new data on a comprehensive sample of public U.S. firms that received FDI between 1979 and 2006. To account for the possibility that performance differences arise due to the selection of superior target firm rather than the change in ownership, I use propensity score matching to create similar comparison groups of target firms prior to acquisitions. The analysis reveals three major findings. First, acquiring firms from industrialized countries lead to labor productivity increases of 13% in the target firm three years after the acquisition compared to targets acquired by domestic firms. Firms that received developing country firm acquisitions, on the other hand, exhibit lower labor productivity gains four years after acquisition, compared to targets acquired by domestic firms. Second, targets receiving FDI by firms from industrial and developing countries also experience increases in profits, compared with firms receiving acquisition by domestic firms from the United States. Third, compared with domestic acquisitions, foreign industrial firm acquisition FDI tends to increase their targets' employment and sales, whereas targets acquired by firms located in developing countries experience a decrease in both revenues and total number of employees. These findings suggest that target firms are subject to significantly different restructuring processes depending on the origin of the acquiring firm.","Chen, Wenjie, 2011.

Journal of International Economics,"Capital, technology, and specialization in the neoclassical model","['Shikher, Serge']","The paper studies the effects of technology and capital stock on trade using simulation. For this purpose, the paper develops and evaluates a model that is distinguished by its use of the Eaton-Kortum framework to explain intra-industry trade instead of the usual Armington assumption. It is found that the magnitudes and in many cases signs of the effects of capital stock and technology on specialization are very country-specific. This implies that the regression studies that estimate cross-country average effects have limited value. Looking at the volume of trade, the paper finds that capital endowments and industry-level comparative advantages have little effect on the volume of trade -- the reduced inter-industry trade between more similar countries is compensated by increased intra-industry trade. Producer heterogeneity, on the other hand, has a significant effect on the volume of trade. The paper evaluates the accuracy of the model's forecasts by performing historical simulations for 1975-95, with the results showing that the model's predictions are accurate.","Shikher, Serge, 2011.

We examine this question using detailed data on sovereign bond issuances and public syndicated bank loans between 1980 and 2000. A key finding of this paper is that the probability of market access is not influenced by a country's frequency of defaults, and that a default, if resolved quickly, does not reduce significantly the probability of tapping the markets. We also find that trade openness, a standard measure of a country's links with the rest of the world, and traditional liquidity and macroeconomic indicators do not help much in explaining market access. However, a country's vulnerability to shocks and the perceived quality of economic policies and institutions appear to influence the government's ability to tap the markets. We also document that the average exclusion from international credit markets following a default declined from four years in the 1980s to two years in the 1990s.","Gelos, R.

In this paper, we study how the entire distribution of markups affects resource misallocation and welfare in a general equilibrium framework encompassing a large class of models with imperfect competition. We then identify conditions under which trade opening, by changing the distribution of markups, may reduce welfare. Our approach is novel both in its generality and in the emphasis on the second moment of the markup distribution. Two broad policy recommendations stand out from the analysis. First, whenever there is heterogeneity in markups, be it due to trade or other distortions, there is also an intersectoral misallocation, so that the equilibrium can be improved upon with an appropriate intervention. This suggests that trade liberalization and domestic industrial policy are complementary. Second, ensuring free entry is a crucial precondition to prevent adverse effects from asymmetric trade opening.","Epifani, Paolo & Gancia, Gino, 2011.

We examine the responses of U.S.-based MNEs and domestic industrial production to a set of intellectual property rights reforms in the 1980s and 1990s. Following reform, MNEs expand the scale of their activities. MNEs that make extensive use of intellectual property disproportionately increase their use of inputs. There is an overall expansion of industrial activity after reform, and highly disaggregated trade data indicate higher exports of new goods.

We also show that, for a given international exposure, the response to exchange rate fluctuations is magnified when firms exhibit a lower monopoly power and when they face foreign pressure in the domestic market through import penetration. The degree of substitutability between imported and other inputs and the distribution of workers by type introduce additional degrees of specificity in the employment sensitivity to exchange rate swings. Moreover, we show that episodes of entry and exit in the export market are associated with a heterogeneous employment response depending on the degree of external orientation when the switch of export status occurs.","Nucci, Francesco & Pozzolo, Alberto Franco, 2010.

Journal of International Economics,Future rent-seeking and current public savings,"['Caballero, Ricardo J.', 'Yared, Pierre']","The conventional wisdom is that politicians' rent-seeking motives increase public debt and deficits. This is because myopic politicians face political risk and prefer to extract political rents as early as possible. In this paper we study the determination of government debt and deficits in a dynamic political economy model. We show that this conventional wisdom relies on economic volatility being low relative to political uncertainty. If economic volatility is high relative to political uncertainty, then a rent-seeking government actually over-saves and over-taxes along the equilibrium path relative to a benevolent government. This result emerges because of the option value of rent-seeking: a rent-seeking government over-values future funds because of the possibility of using them for future rents instead of cutting taxes in the event of a future boom (when marginal utility of private consumption is low). This over-saving bias is temporary since, in the long run, the rent-seeking government over-borrows relative to the benevolent government as it eventually squanders the funds it has accumulated. We find that both the under-saving and over-saving bias of the government can be solved by a rule of capping deficits.","Caballero, Ricardo J. & Yared, Pierre, 2010.

Journal of International Economics,Airplanes and comparative advantage,"['Harrigan, James']","Airplanes are a fast but expensive means of shipping goods, a fact which has implications for comparative advantage. The paper develops a Ricardian model with a continuum of goods which vary by weight and hence transport cost. Comparative advantage depends on relative air and surface transport costs across countries and goods, as well as stochastic productivity. A key testable implication is that the U.S. should import heavier goods from nearby countries, and lighter goods from faraway counties. This implication is tested using detailed data on U.S. imports from 1990 to 2003. Looking across goods the U.S. imports, nearby exporters have lower market share in goods that the rest of the world ships by air. Looking across exporters for individual goods, distance from the US is associated with much higher import unit values. These effects are large, which establish that the model identifies an important influence on specialization and trade.","Harrigan, James, 2010.

Yet the literature has failed to confront two pivotal issues. First, with international technology differences and traded intermediate inputs, there is no existing definition of the factor content of trade that is compatible with Vanek's factor content prediction. We fill this gap. Second, as Helpman and Krugman (1985) showed, many models beyond Heckscher-Ohlin imply the Vanek prediction. Thus, absent a complete list of these models, we do not fully know what models are being tested when the Vanek prediction is tested. We completely characterize the class of models being tested by providing a familiar consumption similarity condition that is necessary and sufficient for a robust Vanek prediction. Finally, we reassess the performance of the prediction using the correct factor content definition and input-output tables for 41 countries. We find that the prediction performs well except for the presence of missing trade. Further, missing trade is not pervasive: it is associated entirely with 'home bias' in the consumption of agricultural goods, government services and construction.","Trefler, Daniel & Zhu, Susan Chun, 2010.

Journal of International Economics,How important is liquidity risk for sovereign bond risk premia? Evidence from the London stock exchange,"['Alquist, Ron']","Using a unique data set, this paper studies the relationship between market liquidity risk and sovereign bond risk premia. The London Stock Exchange during the late 19th century is an ideal laboratory in which to examine the effect of market liquidity on sovereign bond prices. This period was the last time when the debt of a heterogeneous set of countries was traded in a centralized location and for which sufficiently long time series of observable bond prices are available to conduct asset-pricing tests. Empirical analysis of these data establishes two results. First, illiquid sovereign bonds carry larger factor loadings on market liquidity than liquid bonds. The difference in average excess returns is not only due to the larger transaction costs associated with holding illiquid bonds but also to the greater sensitivity of the returns of illiquid bonds to fluctuations in market liquidity. Second, excess bond returns are linearly related to the returns of a liquidity-mimicking portfolio in the cross-section, indicating that market liquidity is a priced common risk factor. At about 2.8% per year, the price for bearing liquidity risk is economically significant. Overall, this evidence underscores the importance of understanding the effect of market liquidity on bond prices, even in an economic environment that seems remote from today's.","Alquist, Ron, 2010.

However, when the spatial separation of markets ceases to be a sufficient protection against foreign competition, high-cost firms choose to set up in the larger market.

Using cross-country data from 30 countries, we find that bilateral production fragmentation has a positive effect while the standard bilateral trade intensity indicator has a negative impact on business-cycle comovement. We also find that the positive effect of trade in complements (captured by bilateral production fragmentation) dominates the negative effect of trade in substitutes (explained by bilateral trade intensity), resulting in an overall positive impact of trade. Hence, bilateral production fragmentation plays a key role underlying the positive response of business-cycle comovement to increases in trade.","Ng, Eric C.Y., 2010.

Journal of International Economics,Hedging price volatility using fast transport,"['Hummels, David L.', 'Schaur, Georg']","Purchasing goods from distant locations introduces a significant lag between when a product is shipped and when it arrives. These transit lags are trade barriers for firms facing volatile demand, who must place orders before knowing the resolution of demand uncertainty. We provide a model in which airplanes bring producers and consumers together in time. Fast transport allows firms to respond quickly to favorable demand realizations and to limit the risk of unprofitably large quantities during low demand periods. The model predicts that the likelihood and extent to which firms employ air shipments is increasing in the volatility of demand they face, decreasing in the air premium they must pay, and increasing in the contemporaneous realization of demand. We confirm all three conjectures using detailed US import data. Fast transport thus provides firms with a real option to smooth demand volatility on international markets, and we provide simple calculations of that option value. This enables us to identify how the option value relates to goods characteristics, and to changes in air transport premia associated with technological and policy change including the introduction of jet engines, and liberalization of trade in air services.","Hummels, David L. & Schaur, Georg, 2010.

Journal of International Economics,Trade skirmishes safeguards: A theory of the WTO dispute settlement process,"['Beshkar, Mostafa']","I propose a framework within which to interpret and evaluate the major reforms introduced to the GATT system in its transition to the WTO. In particular, I examine the WTO Agreement on Safeguards that has amended the GATT escape clause (Article XIX), and the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) that resembles a court of law under the WTO. Using this framework, I interpret the weakening of the reciprocity principle under the Agreement on Safeguards as an attempt to reduce efficiency-reducing trade skirmishes. The DSB is interpreted as an impartial arbitrator that announces its opinion about the state of the world when a dispute arises among member countries. I demonstrate that the reforms in the GATT escape clause should be bundled with the introduction of the DSB, in order to maintain the incentive compatibility of trade agreements. The model implies that trade agreements under the WTO lead to fewer trade skirmishes but this effect does not necessarily result in higher payoffs to the governments. The model also implies that the introduction of the WTO court, which has no enforcement power, can improve the self-enforceability of trade agreements.","Beshkar, Mostafa, 2010.

In particular, they may set up operations in low-cost countries (those operations are referred to as foreign affiliates in those countries) either as platforms for export or serving the growing markets there. What is the exporting behavior of foreign affiliates? In this paper, using data from China, we find that among foreign affiliates exporters are less productive than non-exporters. We then offer a theoretical explanation by incorporating into the standard firm heterogeneity model the possibility that firms could have different stages of production in different countries.","Lu, Jiangyong & Lu, Yi & Tao, Zhigang, 2010.

Journal of International Economics,"Trade policy in a ""super size me"" world","['McCalman, Phillip']","When a foreign monopolist sets a single market clearing price for its product, the sign of the optimal tariff is determined by the extent of pass through (also known as the terms of trade effect). However, when a foreign monopolist employs a second degree price discrimination mechanism in the domestic market the calculus of welfare maximization is very different. While there are still terms of trade effects from the imposition of a tariff, the existence of such effects are neither necessary nor sufficient to determine the sign of the optimal tariff. Instead the distribution of valuations within the population is the key determinant of the nature of policy intervention. This result differs significantly from the uniform price case and is driven by the incentive compatibility constraint which places the distribution of types at the center of the analysis. If there is a relatively large fraction of high valuation types in the population, then domestic information rents may be increased by subsidizing imports thereby increasing the consumption of the low valuation types and moving the incentive constraint in favor of the high valuation types. However, if the share of high types in the population is relatively small then the increase in information rents will also be small but the fiscal implications of a subsidy will be large. Consequently, the optimal policy will be to impose a trade tax.","McCalman, Phillip, 2010.

If, as a result, labor moves to the sector with the lower (or equal) vacancy costs, there is an unambiguous decrease in economywide unemployment. With imperfect intersectoral labor mobility, unemployment in the offshoring sector can rise, with an unambiguous unemployment reduction in the non-offshoring sector.

A two-factor (skilled and unskilled labour), two-sector Heckscher-Ohlin trade model is supplemented with an education sector which uses skilled labour and time to convert unskilled workers into skilled workers. A skilled worker's income depends on her ability, but all unskilled workers have the same income. Trade liberalisation in a relatively skilled labour abundant country increases the relative skilled wage and induces skill upgrading by the existing workforce, with younger and more able unskilled workers most likely to upgrade. But not all upgraders are better off as a result of the liberalisation. The older and less able upgraders are likely to lose. For an anticipated liberalisation we show that the preferred upgrading strategies depend on a worker's ability and that much of the upgrading will take place before the liberalisation. Hence some workers who would have upgraded had they anticipated the liberalisation will not if it is unanticipated, and adjustment assistance that applies only to post-liberalisation upgraders will fail to compensate some losers and distort the upgrading decisions of others.","Falvey, Rod & Greenaway, David & Silva, Joana, 2010.

Journal of International Economics,"Imperfect tax competition for profits, asymmetric equilibrium and beneficial tax havens","['Johannesen, Niels']","We present a model of tax competition for real investment and profits and show that the presence of tax havens in some cases increases the tax revenue of countries. In the first part of the paper, we argue that tax competition for profits is likely to be imperfect in the sense that the jurisdiction with the lowest tax rate does not necessarily attract all shifted profits. Under this assumption, tax competition between a large number of identical countries may lead to either a symmetric equilibrium with no profit shifting or an asymmetric equilibrium where firms shift profits from high-tax to low-tax countries. In the second part of the paper, we introduce tax havens. Starting from a symmetric equilibrium, tax havens unambiguously reduce the tax revenue of countries due to a 'leakage effect' -- tax havens attract tax base from countries -- and a 'competition effect' -- the optimal response to the increased tax sensitivity of tax bases involves a reduction of tax rates. Starting from an asymmetric equilibrium, however, tax havens also raise the tax revenue of countries through a 'crowding effect' -- tax havens make it less attractive to compete for profits and thus induce low-tax countries to become high-tax countries. We demonstrate that the latter effect may dominate the former effects so that countries, on balance, benefit from the presence of tax havens.","Johannesen, Niels, 2010.

Colonial origin is used to isolate exogenous variation in PRs. The impact is then identified by examining the cross-industry difference in sensitivity to PRs. I find that the increase in PRs made in response to the TRIPs agreement added about $35Â billion (2000 US dollars) to the value of developed countries' patent-sensitive exports into 18 developing countries. This amount is equivalent to an 8.6% increase in these developing countries' annual value of patent-sensitive imports.

Our framework allows for multiple cities within a country. Using a panel of U.S.-Canadian city pairs, we estimate a dynamic price adjustment process for 165 individual goods.

The benchmark model assumes uncorrelated shocks across countries and implies that U.S. shocks account for less than 3% of the variability observed in several Canadian series, at all forecast horizons. Accordingly, model-implied cross-correlation functions between Canada and U.S. are essentially zero. Both findings are at odds with the data. A specification that assumes correlated cross-country shocks partially resolves this discrepancy, but still falls well short of matching reduced-form evidence. One central difficulty resides in the model's inability to account for comovement without generating counter factual implications for the real exchange rate, the terms of trade and Canadian inflation.","Justiniano, Alejandro & Preston, Bruce, 2010.

In this model, we endogenize both the currency of liability denomination and the currency of export pricing. We show that a key factor that affects firms' dollarization decisions is exchange rate policy. Twin dollarization is an optimal strategy for all firms when exchange rate flexibility is limited, which implies that a fixed exchange rate regime may lead to an equilibrium with twin dollarization.

The analysis is based on a structural vector autoregression in which monetary policy shocks are identified through the conditional heteroscedasticity of the structural disturbances. Unlike earlier work in this area, our empirical methodology avoids making arbitrary assumptions about the relevant policy indicator or transmission mechanism in order to achieve identification. At the same time, it allows us to assess the implications of imposing invalid identifying restrictions. Our results indicate that the nominal exchange rate exhibits delayed overshooting in response to a monetary expansion, depreciating for roughly ten months before starting to appreciate. The shock also leads to large and persistent departures from uncovered interest rate parity.

While the full sample results provide evidence of both cyclical and structural excess capacity effects for exports to the U.S. market, these effects are confined to such a narrow range of country-product combinations that it is unlikely that such effects were a significant factor in the fortunes of U.S. steel firms over the past decades.","Blonigen, Bruce A. & Wilson, Wesley W., 2010.

Journal of International Economics,Tariff wars in the Ricardian Model with a continuum of goods,"['Opp, Marcus M.']","This paper describes strategic tariff choices within the Ricardian framework of Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson (1977) using CES preferences. The optimum tariff schedule is uniform across goods and inversely related to the import demand elasticity of the other country. In the Nash equilibrium of tariffs, larger economies apply higher tariff rates. Productivity adjusted relative size ([approximate]Â GDP ratio) is a sufficient statistic for absolute productivity advantage and the size of the labor force. Both countries apply higher tariff rates if specialization gains from comparative advantage are high and transportation cost is low. A sufficiently large economy prefers the inefficient Nash equilibrium in tariffs over free trade due to its quasi-monopolistic power on world markets. The required threshold size is increasing in comparative advantage and decreasing in transportation cost. I discuss the implications of the static Nash-equilibrium analysis for the sustainability and structure of trade agreements.","Opp, Marcus M., 2010.

Using a long panel of French birth registries, we assess the media-culture link using name frequencies as a measure of tastes. Controlling for the number of people who currently have a name and unobserved name effects, our regressions show that media influences choices via selective imitation. Parents are much more likely to adopt media names that they associate with youth. Using estimated parameters, we simulate our model of name choice to reveal that, absent foreign media, fewer than 5% of French babies would have been named differently.

The model combines a desire by national governments to attract internationally mobile firms with the existence of location rents that arise even in a symmetric equilibrium where firms are dispersed.

Journal of International Economics,Why do most countries set high tax rates on capital?,"['Marceau, Nicolas', 'Mongrain, Steeve', 'Wilson, John D.']","We consider tax competition in a world with tax bases exhibiting different degrees of mobility, modeled as mobile and immobile capital. An agreement among countries not to give preferential treatment to mobile capital results in an equilibrium where mobile capital is nevertheless taxed relatively lightly. In particular, one or two of the smallest countries, measured by their stocks of immobile capital, choose relatively low tax rates, thereby attracting mobile capital away from the other countries, which are then left to set revenue-maximizing taxes on their immobile capital. This conclusion holds regardless of whether countries choose their tax policies sequentially or simultaneously. In contrast, unrestricted competition for mobile capital results in the preferential treatment of mobile capital by all countries, without cross-country differences in the taxation of mobile capital. Nevertheless our main result is that the non-preferential regime generates larger expected global tax revenue, despite the sizable revenue loss from the emergence of low-tax countries. By extending the analysis to include cross-country differences in productivities, we are able to resurrect a case for preferential regimes, but only if the productivity differences are sufficiently large.","Marceau, Nicolas & Mongrain, Steeve & Wilson, John D., 2010.

Journal of International Economics,The quality of innovation and the extent of the market,"['Spulber, Daniel F.']","I present a comprehensive model of international trade in technology that considers both the demand for inventions and the supply of inventions. On the demand side, domestic and foreign firms make strategic technology adoption decisions. On the supply side, inventors compete to sell licenses for their technology to domestic and foreign firms. Countries benefit from international trade in technology because they obtain the best invention from a larger pool of inventions. International trade in technology increases the extent of the market for inventions and thereby improves the quality of innovation. Technology trade lowers prices, increases outputs, and increases the volume of trade in differentiated products. When traded products are not close substitutes, international markets for technology generate gains from trade. The results of the analysis are robust to the possibility of technology transfer either through expropriation or imitation.

In this model, price-cost margins in a global loan market are endogenous and countercyclical. As a result, a positive TFP shock in one country spills over to another through a reduction in the global cost of both credit and externally financed investment. The quantitative analysis shows that countercyclical margins on loans play a key role in bringing the predictions of the theory closer to the observed cross-country cyclical co-movements of consumption, employment, investment and output. Recessions are deeper when the cost of credit rises during these economic downturns. Thus, a financial accelerator arises in our framework, unveiling the increased importance of stabilization policies in economies where margins in credit markets are countercyclical.","Olivero, María Pía, 2010.

However, contrary to the United States, the employment adjustment (among surviving firms) operates mainly through the job creation rather than the job destruction rate.

Instead, foreigners hold greater shares of their investment portfolios in the United States if they have less developed financial markets. The magnitude of this effect decreases with income per capita. Countries that trade more with the United States also have greater portfolio shares in U.S. equity and bond markets. These results support recent theoretical work on the role of financial development in sustaining global imbalances and have important implications for whether the United States can continue to attract sufficient financing from abroad without major changes in asset prices and returns, especially in bond markets.","Forbes, Kristin J., 2010.

The poor timing of foreign investors-caused primarily by deliberate trading, not a lack of portfolio rebalancing-contributes positively to the U.S. external returns differential. We find no evidence that the poor timing is driven by mechanical reserve accumulation by emerging market countries; rather, it is driven almost entirely by the poor timing of rich, developed (mainly European) countries. Finally, while poor foreign timing appears to be persistent across subsamples, other terms in our decomposition (the composition and return effects and U.S. timing abroad), as well as the overall differential, are sometimes negative, sometimes positive, and usually indistinguishable from zero.","Curcuru, Stephanie E. & Dvorak, Tomas & Warnock, Francis E., 2010.

However, there is little empirical evidence on the foreign currency exposures that are embedded in international balance sheets. Using a new database, we provide stylized facts concerning the cross-country and time-series variation in aggregate foreign currency exposure and its various subcomponents. In panel estimation, we find that richer, more open economies take longer foreign-currency positions. In addition, we find that an increase in the propensity for a currency to depreciate during bad times is associated with a longer position in foreign currencies, providing a hedge against domestic output fluctuations. We view these new stylized facts as informative in their own right and also potentially useful to the burgeoning theoretical literature on the macroeconomics of international portfolios.","Lane, Philip R. & Shambaugh, Jay C., 2010.

Journal of International Economics,Order flows and the exchange rate disconnect puzzle,"['Evans, Martin D.D.']","The aim of this paper is to establish the link between the high frequency dynamics of spot exchange rates and developments in the macroeconomy. To do so, I first present a theoretical model of exchange-rate determination that bridges the gap between existing microstructure and traditional models. The model examines how dispersed microeconomic information known to individual agents outside the foreign exchange market is aggregated and transmitted to dealers via transaction flows (i.e., order flow); and how the information is then embedded in the spot exchange rate. I then report empirical evidence that strongly supports the presence of the link between the macroeconomy, order flow, and high frequency exchange rate returns implied by the model. In fact, my empirical results indicate that between 20 and 30% of the variance in excess currency returns over one- and two-month horizons can be linked back to developments in the macroeconomy. This level of explanatory power is an order of magnitude higher than that found in traditional models -- even the newly developed monetary models incorporating central banks reaction functions. Moreover, it provides a straightforward solution to the exchange-rate disconnect puzzle. Namely, the high frequency behavior of spot exchange rates reflects the flow of new information reaching dealers concerning the slowly evolving state of the macroeconomy, rather than the effects of shocks that drive rapidly changing macroeconomic conditions.","Evans, Martin D.D., 2010.

In our model, domestic stocks are used to hedge fluctuations in local wage income. Terms of trade risk is hedged using bonds denominated in local goods and in foreign goods.

Large and volatile capital flows are necessary to take advantage of international risk premia differentials that occur in response to productivity changes in the nontradable sector.

To address this question, we develop and estimate an open-economy DSGE model in which pass-through is incomplete due to the presence of local currency pricing, distribution services, and a variable demand elasticity that leads to fluctuations in optimal markups. We find that the overall magnitude of trade adjustment is similar in a low and high pass-through environment with more adjustment in a low pass-through world occurring through movements in the terms of trade rather than real trade flows and through a larger response of the exchange rate.","Gust, Christopher & Leduc, Sylvain & Sheets, Nathan, 2009.

After receiving temporary protection by means of a maximum tariff of over 45%, Harley-Davidson sales recovered dramatically. Simulations, based on structural demand and supply estimates, indicate that while safeguard tariffs did benefit Harley-Davidson, they only account for a fraction of its increased sales. This is primarily because consumers perceived that Harley-Davidson and Japanese large motorcycles were poorly matched substitutes for each other.

To answer these questions, we build a simple two-country model with horizontally differentiated NGOs competing in fundraising. We find that NGOs become multinational if the economies of scale in fundraising are sufficiently large. In that case, national NGOs in the smaller country disappear, while some national NGOs remain in the larger country only if country sizes are sufficiently different.

We introduce an information approach that focuses on the other 95%. Important departures from traditional models arise when transactions convey information. First, prices reveal different information depending on whether trades are direct or though vehicle currencies. Second, missing markets arise due to insufficiently symmetric information, rather than insufficient transactions scale. Third, the indeterminacy of equilibrium that arises in traditional models is resolved: currency trade patterns no longer concentrate arbitrarily on market size.

The tax revenue in the equilibrium is substantial, and higher on ""old"" FDI than on ""new"" FDI, even though countries are not allowed to use discriminatory taxation.

We parameterize the model to match the features of the Western and Eastern European members of the EU and analyze first the effects of the trade liberalization which occurred between 1989 and 2004, and then the gains and losses from migration which are expected to occur if legal barriers to labor mobility are substantially reduced. The lower barriers to migration would result in significant migration of skilled workers from Eastern European countries.

We show that past empirical evidence, which strongly supports the growth effect as the main driver of current account dynamics, is misconceived. The remarkable empirical success of the growth effect is driven by the dominance of the cross-sectional variation, which, under conditions met by the data, is generated by an accounting approximation. In contrast to previous findings that the portfolio share of net foreign assets to total assets is constant in a country, both our theoretical and empirical results support a highly persistent process or a unit-root process, with some countries displaying a trend.

It examines the implications of foreign ownership in two different contexts: foreign acquisitions and foreign privatizations. To control for the possible endogeneity of FDI decision propensity score matching is combined with a difference-in-differences approach. The results indicate that foreign ownership leads to significant productivity improvements in the acquired plants. The improvements become visible in the acquisition year and continue in subsequent periods. After three years, the acquired plants exhibit a 13.5% higher productivity than the control group. The rise in productivity is a result of restructuring, as acquired plants increase investment outlays, employment and wages. Foreign ownership also appears to enhance the integration of plants into the global economy through increased exports and imports.

Journal of International Economics,Monetary policy and exchange rate overshooting: Dornbusch was right after all,"['Bjørnland, Hilde C.']","Dornbusch's exchange rate overshooting hypothesis is a central building block in international macroeconomics. Yet, empirical studies of monetary policy have typically found exchange rate effects that are inconsistent with overshooting. This puzzling result has been viewed by some researchers as a ""stylized fact"" to be reckoned with in policy modelling. However, many of these studies, in particular those using vector autoregressive (VARs) approaches, have disregarded the strong contemporaneous interaction between monetary policy and exchange rate movements by placing zero restrictions on them. In contrast, we achieve identification by imposing a long-run neutrality restriction on the real exchange rate, thereby allowing for contemporaneous interaction between the interest rate and the exchange rate. In a study of four open economies, we find that the puzzles disappear. In particular, a contractionary monetary policy shock has a strong effect on the exchange rate, which appreciates on impact. The maximum effect occurs within 1-2 quarters, and the exchange rate thereafter gradually depreciates to baseline, consistent with the Dornbusch overshooting hypothesis and with few exceptions consistent with uncovered interest parity (UIP).","Bjørnland, Hilde C., 2009.

The higher non-tradable prices serve as incentive for an expansion of that sector, culminating in reallocation of labor away from the tradable sector -- a phenomenon known as the Dutch disease.

In contrast to the literature on multilateral bargaining, the set of agreements can form a (nonpartitional) network, while in contrast to the network literature, players can reach multilateral agreements. Patient enough countries only reach bilateral agreements if insiders gain more than outsiders, which allows them to manipulate the status quo in subsequent negotiations. However, a hub and spoke pattern may then emerge, and insiders then dissipate the advantages of strategic positioning. We also use variants on the model to explain why a US commitment not to bargain bilaterally sustained progress at GATT negotiations, and the rarity of open access preferential trading arrangements.","Seidmann, Daniel J., 2009.

It is found that for the top 20th percentile of countries in terms of growth in U.S multinational affiliate value added, as much as 8.6% of that growth between 1999 and 2003 can be attributed to declining relative stringency and enforcement of environmental policy.

A North-South model of international trade is introduced in which the number of countries in each region can be varied. As the number of countries in one region is increased, each government there competes more aggressively with the others in its region, by lowering its tariff, to attract imports from the other region. In doing so, all countries in a region exert a negative terms-of-trade externality on each other, collectively undermining their own terms of trade and welfare. This externality can increase efficiency if the numbers of countries in both regions are increased simultaneously.","Zissimos, Ben, 2009.

We claim that the marketing costs that emerge when the commercialization of export crops requires intermediaries can lead to lower participation into export cropping and, thus, to higher poverty. We test the model using data from the Uganda National Household Survey. We show that: i) farmers living in villages with fewer outlets for sales of agricultural exports are likely to be poorer than farmers residing in market-endowed villages; ii) market availability leads to increased household participation in export cropping (coffee, tea, cotton, fruits); iii) households engaged in export cropping are less likely to be poor than subsistence-based households. We conclude that the availability of markets for agricultural export crops help realize the gains from trade.

To obtain sharp results, we restrict attention to an economy that takes as given the price of imports and the demand schedules for its exports (a ""small economy""). We first establish that welfare can be decomposed into four terms: productivity, terms of trade, variety and curvature, where the last is a term that captures heterogeneity across varieties. We then show how a consumption subsidy, an export tax, or an import tariff allows our small economy to deal with two distortions that we identify and thereby reach its first-best allocation. We also show that an export subsidy generates an increase in productivity, but given the negative joint effect on the other three terms (terms of trade, variety, and curvature), welfare falls.

Journal of International Economics,Subsidies for FDI: Implications from a model with heterogeneous firms,"['Chor, Davin']","This paper analyzes the welfare effects of subsidies to attract multinational corporations when firms are heterogeneous in their productivity levels. I show that the use of a small subsidy raises welfare in the FDI host country, with the consumption gains from attracting more multinationals exceeding the direct cost of funding the subsidy program through a tax on labor income. This welfare gain stems from a selection effect, whereby the subsidy induces only the most productive exporters to switch to servicing the host's market via FDI. I further show that for the same total subsidy bill, a subsidy to variable costs delivers a larger welfare gain than a subsidy to the fixed cost of conducting FDI, since a variable cost subsidy also raises the inefficiently low output levels stemming from each firm's markup pricing power.","Chor, Davin, 2009.

Rose']","The tyranny of distance in terms of its effect on median earnings and housing costs is examined for rural and urban U.S. counties. First, we develop a series of distance metrics for an area's remoteness from multiple tiers of the urban hierarchy. Second, we consider geographical access of buyers and sellers through market potential measures typical of those used in empirical studies of the New Economic Geography. We estimate penalties of about 5 to 9% for median earnings and 12 to 17% for housing costs for area remoteness from the combined tiers of the urban hierarchy. Differences in market potential also influence factor prices, but these effects generally are smaller than those produced by urban hierarchy distances. Thus, it appears that empirical tests of New Economic Geography models need to consider sources of agglomeration spillovers beyond aggregate market potential.","Partridge, Mark D. & Rickman, Dan S. & Ali, Kamar & Olfert, M.

Journal of International Economics,Hares and stags in Argentinean debt restructuring,"['Engelen, Christian', 'Lambsdorff, Johann Graf']","The latest Argentinean debt restructuring was the first time the resolution of a modern financial crisis was completely handed over to the private financial markets without official intervention by public institutions. We argue that the resulting harshest haircut for private creditors in history can be at least partially related to a stag-hunt game played by creditors. We show that incentive schemes provided by the Argentinean government were factors facilitating this haircut. The analysis suggests that, contrary to the recognition in the literature, the effects of Collective Action Clauses and Exit Consents within a restructuring process are not equal. In the case of Argentina, the inclusion of Collective Action Clauses in the defaulted bonds could have benefited the holdout creditors.","Engelen, Christian & Lambsdorff, Johann Graf, 2009.

Some important questions concerning trade policy are why a disproportionate share of protection goes to declining industries and why trade policy has an anti-trade bias. We show that if individual preferences exhibit sufficient loss aversion, higher protection will be given to sectors in which profitability is declining. We also show that if the coefficient of loss aversion is large enough, there will be an anti-trade bias in trade policy. Using a nonlinear regression procedure, we find support for the model and the estimates of the loss aversion parameters are very close to those obtained by Kahneman and Tversky (Kahneman, D., Tversky, A., 1992.

We show that, by adopting the bi-sourcing strategy, firms can use the payoff from one supplier as a backup option in negotiating with the other supplier (the cross-threat effect). When firms conduct bi-sourcing in the global economy consisting of the high-waged North and low-waged South, they need to make the location choice for both insourcing and outsourcing. We find that the low wage in the South can encourage investment by component suppliers (the cost effect). However, firms may achieve a better cross-threat effect by relocating overly strong component supplier from the cost-advantageous South to the cost-disadvantageous North (the balancing effect). The optimal bi-sourcing strategy is determined by the interplay of the cost effect and the balancing effect.","Du, Julan & Lu, Yi & Tao, Zhigang, 2009.

This paper incorporates labor market rigidities in a model of footloose capital in order to study how globalization might affect the trade-offs generated by labor market regulation and put pressure on labor market institutions. In this two-sector model, globalization ultimately reduces labor market rigidities through either one of two channels: capital mobility triggers a re-allocation of resources, which trade integration amplifies, away from the high-rent / highly-unionized sector; the threat of costly relocations encourages labor market deregulation.

However, data limitations have prevented much progress in combining these two areas, because very few countries provide firm-level data breaking down firm exports by their destination. This paper uses a unique survey of Irish exporting firms with information on over fifty destinations for a five-year period to fill some of the gaps in this empirical literature. In particular we investigate how well the predications of a model of exporting with firm heterogeneity fits with the patterns of this detailed data source. Amongst our findings are that firm productivity differences are a factor in explaining the number of export markets a firm has but the prediction of a hierarchy of markets could only be weakly upheld by the data. Firm involvement in individual export markets is found to be much more dynamic than export status. Entry and exit to markets is shown to be a quantifiably important component of overall export flows, with this factor becoming more important for less popular markets. The paper also shows how the patterns of entry and exit into export markets combine to determine the overall firm-level distribution of number of markets entered.","Lawless, Martina, 2009.

Journal of International Economics,On the origins of comparative advantage,"['Costinot, Arnaud']","This paper proposes a simple theory of international trade with endogenous productivity differences across countries. The core of our analysis lies in the determinants of the division of labor. We consider a world economy comprising two large countries, with a continuum of goods and one factor of production, labor. Each good is characterized by its complexity, defined as the number of tasks that must be performed to produce one unit. There are increasing returns to scale in the performance of each task, which creates gains from specialization, and uncertainty in the enforcement of each contract, which create transaction costs. The trade-off between these two forces pins down the size of productive teams across sectors in each country. Under free trade, the country where teams are larger specializes in the more complex goods. In our model, it is the country where the product of institutional quality and human per worker capital is larger. Hence, better institutions and more educated workers are complementary sources of comparative advantage in the more complex industries.","Costinot, Arnaud, 2009.

A tractable linear-quadratic approximation permits a representation of the optimal policy plan in terms of targeting rules. In the optimal equilibrium, monetary policy should achieve aggregate price stability following a flexible inflation targeting rule. Fiscal policy should stabilize idiosyncratic shocks allowing for permanent variations of government debt but should abstain from creating inflationary expectations at the union level. Simple policy rules can approximate the optimal commitment benchmark through a mix of strict inflation targeting and flexible budget rules.

The presence of an internal monopolistic distortion and a terms of trade externality drives optimal policy away from domestic inflation targeting and affects the optimal level of exchange rate volatility. When domestic and foreign goods are close substitutes for each other, the optimal policy rule implies lower real exchange rate volatility than a domestic inflation targeting regime.

To study the joint decision of holding sovereign debt and reserves, we construct a stochastic dynamic equilibrium model calibrated to a sample of emerging markets. We obtain that the reserve accumulation does not play a quantitatively important role in this model. In fact, we find the optimal policy is not to hold reserves at all.

Journal of International Economics,Trade policy of a free trade agreement in the presence of foreign lobbying,"['Stoyanov, Andrey']",This paper studies the effect of foreign lobbies on trade policy of a country which is a member of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). It uses a monopolistically competitive political economy model in which the government determines external tariffs endogenously. The effect of foreign lobbying under the FTA is examined empirically using Canadian industry-level trade data that allow differentiating of lobby groups by the country of origin. The analysis suggests that the presence of foreign lobbying has a significant effect on the domestic trade policy. The heterogeneity of foreign lobbies is also important: the presence of an organized lobbying group in an FTA partner country tends to raise trade barriers while an organized lobbying group of exporters from outside of the FTA is associated with less protection.,"Stoyanov, Andrey, 2009.

The model is constructed to yield testable implications for the dynamics of prices, productivity and markups as functions of openness to trade at a sectoral level. The theory lends itself naturally to a difference in differences estimation, with international differences in trade openness at the sector level reflecting international differences in the competitive structure of markets. Predictions are derived for the effects of both domestic and foreign openness on each economy. Using disaggregated data for EU manufacturing over the period 1989-1999 we find short run evidence that trade openness exerts a competitive effect, with prices and markups falling and productivity rising. The response of profit margins to openness has implications on the conduct of monetary policy. Consistent with the predictions of some recent theoretical models we find some, albeit weaker, support that the long run effects are more ambiguous and may even be anti-competitive. Domestic trade liberalization also appears to induce pro-competitive effects on overseas markets.","Chen, Natalie & Imbs, Jean & Scott, Andrew, 2009.

This benefits local consumers who save on trade costs and exerts an upward pressure on relative wages. As a consequence, relative prices in the traded good sector either increase or fall in general equilibrium. In a panel cointegration framework, the wage effect is shown to dominate. This means the HBS effect is strengthened by the relocation of traded good producers.","Méjean, Isabelle, 2008.

The trade impeding effects of technical regulations are especially worrisome for developing countries: they frequently lack the human and capital resources necessary to satisfy technical measures, and thus are more likely to be excluded from markets by technical measures. This paper uses highly disaggregated US data on agricultural, mining and manufacturing imports to examine the impact of technical regulations on trade patterns. Using instrumental variables estimation to correct for the potential endogeneity of technical regulations, the analysis suggests that technical regulations substantially impinge on poor countries' exports: their weaker capacities to satisfy technical regulations lead them to specialize away from industries with heavier regulatory burdens.","Essaji, Azim, 2008.

The key determinants of invoice currency choice are industry features and country size, with some role for foreign-exchange bid-ask spreads. The coalescing effect also goes a long way to explaining the well-known dominance of the dollar. Trade flows to the United States are predominantly invoiced in dollar, as foreign exporters face competition with U.S. firms.

We find that those ""normal"" market conditions were instead often violated in proximity of financial crises: The law of one price often weakened (by 54% on average) and domestic sources of risk became more important (often by more than 100%) for many emerging ADRs.

This paper contributes to the literature by postulating that differentiated products may be subject to greater tariff evasion due to the difficulties associated with assessing their quality and price. Using product-level data on trade between Germany and 10 Eastern European countries during 1992-2003, we find empirical support for this hypothesis. We show that the trade gap, defined as the discrepancy between the value of exports reported by Germany and the value of imports from Germany reported by the importing country, is positively related to the level of tariff in 8 out of 10 countries. Further, we show that the responsiveness of the trade gap to the tariff level is greater for differentiated products than for homogeneous goods. A one-percentage-point increase in the tariff rate is associated with a 0.4% increase in the trade gap in the case of homogeneous products and a 1.7% increase in the case of differentiated products. Finally, the data indicate that tariff evasion takes place through misrepresentation of the import prices rather than underreporting of quantities or product misclassification.","Javorcik, Beata S. & Narciso, Gaia, 2008.

This paper attempts a joint, albeit partial, rationalization of these facts in an environment with no staggered contracts and where prices are preset for only one quarter. There are two key innovations in the paper. First, we augment a standard two-country open economy model with learning-by-doing in production at the firm level. This induces monopolistically competitive firms to endogeneize the productivity effect of their price setting behavior. Specifically, firms endogenously choose not to adjust prices by the full proportion of a positive monetary shock in order to take advantage of the productivity benefits of higher production. Second, we introduce habits in leisure. This makes the labor supply decision dynamic and adds an additional source of propagation. We show that the calibrated model can quantitatively reproduce significant fractions of the aforementioned facts. Moreover, as in the data, the model also produces a positive correlation between the terms of trade and the nominal exchange rate.","Johri, Alok & Lahiri, Amartya, 2008.

Journal of International Economics,"Sovereign defaults: Information, investment and credit","['Sandleris, Guido']","Why would a sovereign government, immune from bankruptcy procedures and with few assets that could be seized in the event of a default, ever repay foreign creditors? And, correspondingly, why do foreign creditors lend to sovereigns? This paper finds general conditions under which, even in the absence of sanctions, lending to sovereigns can emerge in a single shot game. Furthermore, it shows that positive borrowing can be sustained both in pooling and separating equilibria. In this way, it makes clear that neither sanctions nor reputation considerations, the two classical explanations, are necessary to enforce repayment. Information revelation is the crucial mechanism for these results. The repayment/default decision is interpreted as a signal used by the government to communicate information to domestic and foreign agents about the fundamentals of the economy. Governments repay to affect agents' expectations about them. A default, through its effect on expectations about fundamentals, can generate a decline in foreign and domestic investment and a credit crunch in domestic credit markets. Governments repay to avoid these costs, but may default (in equilibrium) when hit by a negative shock.","Sandleris, Guido, 2008.

Through this channel, free-trade may amplify international wage differences. At the same time, integration with countries where IPRs are weakly protected can slow down the world growth rate. An important implication of these results is that protection of intellectual property is most beneficial in open countries. This prediction, which is novel in the literature, is consistent with evidence from a panel of 53 countries observed in the years 1965-1990. The paper also provides empirical support for the mechanism linking North-South trade to the direction of technical change: an increase in import penetration from low-wage, low-IPRs countries is followed by a sharp fall in R&D investment in a panel of US manufacturing sectors.","Gancia, Gino & Bonfiglioli, Alessandra, 2008.

This paper is a first attempt at disentangling the effects of financial integration on the two main determinants of economic performance: productivity (TFP) and investment. I provide empirical evidence from a sample of 70 countries observed between 1975 and 1999. The results for both de jure and de facto indicators suggest that financial integration has a positive direct effect on productivity, while it does not directly affect capital accumulation. I also control for indirect effects of financial globalization through financial development and banking and currency crises. While financial integration does not systematically increase domestic financial depth, it may raise the likelihood of banking crises, though only to a minor extent. Yet, the overall effect of financial liberalization remains positive for productivity and negligible for investment.","Bonfiglioli, Alessandra, 2008.

Two key results emerge. First, the productivity of the average firm receiving protection moderately improves, but this is never sufficient to close the productivity gap with firms never involved in antidumping cases. Second, allowing for firm heterogeneity reveals that domestic firms with relatively low initial productivity - laggard firms - have productivity gains during protection, while firms with high initial productivity - frontier firms - experience productivity losses during protection. These results are consistent with recent theories showing that trade policy affects firms differently depending on their initial productivity.","Konings, Jozef & Vandenbussche, Hylke, 2008.

Journal of International Economics,Firm heterogeneity and location choice of Taiwanese multinationals,"['Aw, Bee Yan', 'Lee, Yi']","This paper examines the extent to which production location decisions of Taiwanese multinationals reflect underlying patterns of firm productivity. In our theoretical model, heterogeneous firms in a middle-income country decide on the optimal production locations for serving three geographically separate markets: domestic, foreign high-income and foreign low-income. The model shows that the equilibrium decision of a firm depends on the fixed investment costs of establishing foreign subsidiaries, production costs, transportation costs, market size and its own productivity level. Using firm-level data in 2000, Taiwanese electronics firms are divided into four different categories: non-FDI, investors in China only, investors in the U.S. only, investors in both China and the U.S. We use a multinomial logit model to link firms' location choices with their productivity, controlling for country, industry and other firm characteristics. Our empirical results are consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model. We show that more productive firms engage in outward FDI, with the most productive ones investing in both China and the U.S. We also provide evidence indicating that Taiwanese multinationals investing only in the U.S. are more productive than those investing exclusively in China due to smaller fixed investment costs in China relative to the U.S.","Aw, Bee Yan & Lee, Yi, 2008.

Journal of International Economics,Who bears the cost of a change in the exchange rate? Pass-through accounting for the case of beer,"['Hellerstein, Rebecca']","Nominal exchange rates are remarkably volatile. They ordinarily appear disconnected from the fundamentals of the economies whose currencies they price. These facts make up a classic puzzle about the international economy. If prices do not respond fully to changes in the nominal exchange rate, who bears the cost of such large and unpredictable changes: foreign firms, domestic firms, or domestic consumers? This study presents a new analysis of the sources of incomplete pass-through and then uses this analysis to re-examine its implications for social welfare. I develop and estimate a structural model that analyzes the sources of local-currency price stability for a particular industry. The model enables counterfactual simulations that quantify the relative importance of firms' local-cost components and markup adjustments in the incomplete transmission of exchange-rate shocks to prices and the effect of the exchange-rate shock on domestic and foreign firms' profits and on consumer surplus. The model is applied to a panel dataset of one industry with retail and wholesale prices for UPC-level products. I find that markup adjustments by manufacturers and the retailer explain roughly half of the incomplete transmission and local-cost components account for the other half. Foreign manufacturers generally bear a greater cost (or reap a greater benefit) following an exchange-rate-induced marginal-cost shock than do domestic consumers, domestic manufacturers, or the domestic retailer.","Hellerstein, Rebecca, 2008.

I exploit shocks to the availability of external finance and examine the impact of equity market liberalizations on the export behavior of 91 countries in the 1980-1997 period. I show that liberalizations increase exports disproportionately more in financially vulnerable sectors that require more outside finance or employ fewer collateralizable assets. This result is not driven by cross-country differences in factor endowments and is independent of simultaneous trade policy reforms. Moreover, it obtains with equal strength in the full panel of countries as well as in both panel and event-study analyses of countries which removed capital controls during the sample period. Finally, the effects of liberalizations are more pronounced in economies with initially less active stock markets, indicating that foreign equity flows may substitute for an underdeveloped domestic financial system. Similarly, opening equity markets has a greater impact in the presence of higher trade costs caused by restrictive trade policies.","Manova, Kalina, 2008.

In particular, it is shown that retaliation is a necessary feature of any efficient equilibrium. We argue that retaliation would not be necessary if governments could resort to international transfers or export subsidies to compensate for terms-of-trade externalities. Within the current world trading system, though, in which transfers are seldom observed whereas export subsidies are prohibited, the use of the remaining trade instruments in a retaliatory fashion might be optimal. The model is used to interpret the retaliatory use of antidumping observed in the last decades, and the proliferation of these measures relative to other trade remedies.","Martin, Alberto & Vergote, Wouter, 2008.

Results for Canada also indicate that import and consumer prices have become less responsive to exchange-rate movements in the 1990s. These findings are based on reduced-form regressions that are typically motivated by partial-equilibrium models of pricing. This paper uses instead a structural, general-equilibrium approach to test the premise that exchange rate pass-through has decreased in Canada. Our approach consists in estimating a dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium model for Canada over two sub-samples, which cover the periods before and after the adoption of inflation targeting by the Bank of Canada. We then use impulse-response analysis to assess the stability of exchange rate pass-through across the two sub-samples. Our results indicate that pass-through to Canadian import prices has been rather stable, while pass-through to Canadian consumer prices has declined in recent years.

To explore the reasons for this shift, we decompose the change in the distance elasticity of trade into the part due to a shift in the composition of trade among industries and the part due to a change in the distance sensitivity within industries. We find that adjustment in the composition of trade had little effect, but for 40% of industries distance became more important, with nearly all of the remaining industries showing no significant change. We explore alternative hypotheses as to why the elasticity of trade to distance increased in some industries. We find that homogeneous goods, bulky goods, and high tariff goods became significantly more distance sensitive. In contrast, the evidence implies that changes in tariffs and freight costs have reduced the importance of distance on trade. We conclude that the increase in the importance of distance over time is related to the substitutability of goods and the level of trade costs, but not to changes in tariffs or freight costs.","Berthelon, Matias & Freund, Caroline, 2008.

Journal of International Economics,Firm heterogeneity and lobby participation,"['Bombardini, Matilde']","The structure of protection across sectors has been interpreted as the result of competition among lobbies to influence politicians, but lobbies have been treated as unitary decision makers and little attention has been devoted to the importance of individual firms in this process. This paper builds a model where individual firms determine the amount of resources to allocate to political contributions and shows that, in the presence of a fixed cost of channeling political contributions, it is efficient for a lobby to be formed by the largest firms in a sector. Therefore the size distribution of firms plays an important role: sectors with a higher share of firms above a given size exhibit higher intensity of political activity. This prediction is borne out by the data: industries characterized by higher firm size dispersion obtain a higher level of protection. The model is also tested against the leading 'Protection for Sale' paradigm, employing a newly matched data set on firm-level political contributions. The empirical evidence shows that, accounting for individual firm behavior, the model explains a larger fraction of the variation of protection across sectors.","Bombardini, Matilde, 2008.

Journal of International Economics,"The dynamics of exchange rate regimes: Fixes, floats, and flips","['Klein, Michael W.', 'Shambaugh, Jay C.']","The impermanence of fixed exchange rates has become a stylized fact in international finance. The combination of the ""mirage"" view that pegs do not really peg with the ""fear of floating"" view that floats do not really float generates the conclusion that exchange rate regimes are, in practice, unimportant for the behavior of the exchange rate. This is consistent with evidence on the irrelevance of exchange rate regimes for general macroeconomic performance. Recent studies, however, show that the exchange rate regime matters. This can be understood by considering the dynamics of exchange rate regimes. We demonstrate that the ""mirage"" view is somewhat misleading and incomplete. Pegs frequently break, but many do last. Also, there is a high degree of flipping, that is, the re-formation of pegs that have broken. Thus, a fixed exchange rate today is a good predictor that one will exist in the future. We also investigate the quantitative effect of fixed exchange rates. While the ""fear of floating"" view suggests little actual difference in fixed and floating rates with respect to exchange rate volatility, we show that fixed exchange rates exhibit considerably greater bilateral exchange rate stability than flexible rates, both today and in the future.","Klein, Michael W. & Shambaugh, Jay C., 2008.

We first confirm the presence of a substantial association between interdealer order flow and exchange rate returns at horizons ranging from 1Â min to two weeks, but find that the association is substantially weaker at longer horizons. We study the time-variation of the association between exchange rate returns and order flow both intradaily and over the long term, and show that the relationship appears to be stronger when market liquidity is lower. Overall, our study supports the view that liquidity effects play an important role in the relationship between order flow and exchange rate changes.

When economies trade, labor market policies in one country spill over to other countries through their effect on the terms of trade. A key finding in the open economy is that the share of the welfare gains from domestic labor market reform exported substantially exceeds the share of goods exported. Thus, with international trade, a country retains little to no benefit from unilaterally reforming its labor market. A coordinated elimination of firing taxes yields considerable benefits. We also find that the U.K. benefits from labor market reform by its continental trading partners.

In our theoretical model, heterogeneous firms in a middle-income country decide on the optimal production locations for serving three geographically separate markets: domestic, foreign high-income and foreign low-income. The model shows that the equilibrium decision of a firm depends on the fixed investment costs of establishing foreign subsidiaries, production costs, transportation costs, market size and its own productivity level. Using firm-level data in 2000, Taiwanese electronics firms are divided into four different categories: non-FDI, investors in China only, investors in the U.S. only, investors in both China and the U.S. We use a multinomial logit model to link firms' location choices with their productivity, controlling for country, industry and other firm characteristics. Our empirical results are consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model. We show that more productive firms engage in outward FDI, with the most productive ones investing in both China and the U.S. We also provide evidence indicating that Taiwanese multinationals investing only in the U.S. are more productive than those investing exclusively in China due to smaller fixed investment costs in China relative to the U.S.","Aw, Bee Yan & Lee, Yi, 2008.

""Across-product versus within-product specialization in international trade."" Quarterly Journal of Economics, 119 (2): 647-678] makes two empirical observations about U.S. imports. (1) The United States is increasingly sourcing the same product (however narrowly defined) from both developed and developing countries. That is, 'across-product specialization' has been decreasing. (2) The unit values of these multiple-sourced products are positively and significantly correlated with the capital and skill abundance of exporters and with the capital-labor ratios used by exporters. That is, endowments-driven 'within-product specialization' has been increasing. We show that both these observations extend to the imports of Brazil, India and Japan. However, our main finding is that observation (1) is largely driven by two factors. First, China is the dominant low-wage exporter of multiple-sourced products. Second, the most developed countries remain the primary exporters of multiple-sourced products. The U.S. case is the most extreme of our four importers: When China is deleted from the U.S. import data there is no trend in across-product specialization and rich exporters are increasing their trade share of multiple-sourced products. Since deleting China has no theoretical justification, these results must be viewed not as a contradiction of Schott's work but as a way of deepening our understanding of his empirical results.","Pham, Cong S., 2008.

We use a rich dataset of Swedish firms that extends over two decades to track firm choices between alternative strategies. We find that higher levels of international competition increase the probability of exit by merger and closedown. If trade is more intra-industry in character, the effect of import penetration on the probability of exit is less. The probability of exit by switching industry is higher in revealed comparative disadvantage industries. Finally, we find that the geographical source of international competition is important, the effects of trade on exit being strongest when trading partners are other OECD countries.","Greenaway, David & Gullstrand, Joakim & Kneller, Richard, 2008.

The likelihood of new RTA membership is influenced by economic fundamentals such as country size, factor endowments, and trade and investment costs. In a sample of country-pairs covering mainly the OECD economies we find a particularly strong effect of endogenous RTAs on intra-industry trade in a difference-in-difference analysis based on matching techniques. The associated trade volume effects are similar to the ones found in previous research on the effects of endogenous RTAs. Overall, this indicates that RTA membership might reduce inter-industry trade not only in relative but also in absolute terms and that the trade volume effect is due to the associated growth in trade within industries.","Egger, Hartmut & Egger, Peter & Greenaway, David, 2008.

This paper empirically studies the effects of fiscal policy (government budget deficit shocks) on the current account and the real exchange rate, during the flexible exchange rate regime period. Based on VAR (Vector Auto-Regression) models, we identified ""exogenous"" fiscal policy shocks after controlling for business cycle effects on fiscal balances. In contrast to the predictions of most theoretical models, the U.S. results suggest that an expansionary fiscal policy shock, or a government budget deficit shock, improve the current account and depreciate the real exchange rate. Increases in private savings and declines in investment contribute to the current account improvement while a nominal exchange rate depreciation, as opposed to a relative price level change, is mainly responsible for the real exchange rate depreciation. The ""twin divergence"" of fiscal balances and current account balances is also explained by the prevalence of output shocks, i.e. output shocks -- more than fiscal shocks -- appear to drive the co-movements of the current account and the fiscal balance.","Kim, Soyoung & Roubini, Nouriel, 2008.

This paper investigates the ability of a region participating in a currency union to affect its inflation differential with respect to the union through fiscal policy. In a two-region general equilibrium model with traded and nontraded goods, lowering the labor income tax rate in response to positive inflation differentials succeeds in compressing inflation differentials. Such policies can lead to higher volatility of domestic inflation while leaving the volatility of real output roughly unchanged. Regional fiscal policies also have spill-over effects on the volatility of union-wide and foreign inflation in our model.","Duarte, Margarida & Wolman, Alexander L., 2008.

Journal of International Economics,Welfare gains from Foreign Direct Investment through technology transfer to local suppliers,"['Blalock, Garrick', 'Gertler, Paul J.']","We hypothesize that multinational firms operating in emerging markets transfer technology to local suppliers to increase their productivity and to lower input prices. To avoid hold-up by any single supplier, the foreign firm must make the technology widely available. This technology diffusion induces entry and more competition which lowers prices in the supply market. As a result, not just the foreign-owned firm, but all firms downstream of that supply market obtain lower prices. We test this hypothesis using a panel dataset of Indonesian manufacturing establishments. We find strong evidence of productivity gains, greater competition, and lower prices among local firms in markets that supply foreign entrants. The technology transfer is Pareto improving -- output and profits increase for firms in both the supplier and buyer sectors. Further, the technology transfer generates an externality that benefits buyers in other sectors downstream from the supply sector as well. This externality may provide a justification for policy intervention to encourage foreign investment.","Blalock, Garrick & Gertler, Paul J., 2008.

On November 18, 1997, the European Union announced its intention to file a complaint before the World Trade Organization (WTO), arguing that the United States provided American exporters illegal subsidies by permitting them to use Foreign Sales Corporations to exempt a fraction of export profits from taxation. Share prices of American exporters fell sharply on this news, and its implication that the WTO might force the United States to eliminate the subsidy, which happened in 2004. The share price declines were largest for exporters with high profit margins and those whose tax situations made the threatened export subsidy particularly valuable. This evidence suggests that export subsidies do not merely benefit foreign consumers, but also improve the profitability of exporters, particularly those earning rents in imperfectly competitive markets.","Desai, Mihir A. & Hines Jr., James R., 2008.

The pro-growth effect stems from the impact that freer trade has on the marginal cost of innovating.

Using a novel database of bilateral capital stocks for all types of investment - FDI, portfolio equity securities, debt securities as well as loans - for a broad set of 77 countries, we show that such a pecking order indeed exists. Motivated by the theoretical work on the capital structure of firms, the paper focuses on two key determinants of this pecking order: information frictions and the quality of host country institutions. Overall, we find that in particular FDI, and to some extent also loans, are substantially more sensitive to information frictions than investment in portfolio equity and debt securities. We also show that the share as well as the size of FDI that a country receive are largely insensitive to institutional factors in host countries, while portfolio investment is by far the most sensitive to the quality of institutions.

We show that it is optimal for a government to provide higher R&D subsidies the lower the level of trade costs, even if the firms are independent monopolies. If firms produce imperfect substitutes, policy competition may become so fierce that only one of the firms survives. International policy harmonization eliminates policy competition and ensures a symmetric outcome. However, it is shown that harmonization is not necessarily welfare-maximizing.

Journal of International Economics,Tax competition when firms choose their organizational form: Should tax loopholes for multinationals be closed,"['Bucovetsky, Sam', 'Haufler, Andreas']",We analyze a sequential game between two symmetric countries when firms can invest in a multinational structure that confers tax savings. Governments are able to commit to long-run tax discrimination policies before firms' decisions are made and before statutory capital tax rates are chosen non-cooperatively. Whether a coordinated reduction in the tax preferences granted to mobile firms is beneficial or harmful for the competing countries depends critically on the elasticity with which the firms' organizational structure responds to tax discrimination incentives. The model can be applied to recent policy initiatives that aim at a ban on preferential tax regimes and at reducing the profit shifting opportunities for multinational firms.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.),"Bucovetsky, Sam & Haufler, Andreas, 2008.

Equity markets, moreover, react differently to news depending on the stage of the business cycle, which explains the low correlation between stock and bond returns when averaged over the cycle.

We show how the structure of coalition externalities shapes the choice between sequential and multilateral bargaining, and we identify circumstances in which the grand coalition is the equilibrium outcome, leading to worldwide free trade. A model of international trade is then used to illustrate equilibrium outcomes and how they depend on the structure of trade and protection. Global free trade is not achieved when the political-economy motive for protection is sufficiently large. Furthermore, the model generates both â€œbuilding blocâ€ and â€œstumbling blocâ€ effects of preferential trade agreements. In particular, we describe an equilibrium in which global free trade is attained only when preferential trade agreements are permitted to form (a building bloc effect), and an equilibrium in which global free trade is attained only when preferential trade agreements are forbidden (a stumbling bloc effect).

Journal of International Economics,Do exports generate higher productivity? Evidence from Slovenia,"['De Loecker, Jan']","I use matched sampling techniques to analyze whether firms that start exporting become more productive. To this end, I use micro data of Slovenian manufacturing firms operating between the period 1994-2000. I estimate total factor productivity using the Olley-Pakes correction for sample selection and for potential endogeneity of the input factors. In most sectors I find evidence supporting the learning by exporting hypothesis controlling for the self-selection process explicitly. Exporting firms become on average 20 percent more productive once they start exporting. This result is robust to other controls that may be associated with increased productivity, such as private ownership. Finally, I introduce export as a state variable in the dynamic program of the firm and allow exporting firms to face different market structures and factor prices. This leads to a modification in the Olley and Pakes estimation algorithm.

Journal of International Economics,"Productivity, terms of trade and the `home market effect'","['Corsetti, Giancarlo', 'Martin, Philippe', 'Pesenti, Paolo']","This paper analyzes the international transmission and welfare implications of productivity gains and changes in market size when macroeconomic adjustment occurs both along the intensive margin of trade (changes in the relative price of existing varieties of tradable goods) and the extensive margin (creation and destruction of varieties). We draw a distinction between productivity gains that enhance manufacturing efficiency and gains that lower the cost of firms' entry and of product differentiation. Countries with lower manufacturing costs have higher GDP but supply their products at lower international prices. Instead, countries with lower entry costs supply a larger array of goods at improved terms of trade. Output growth driven by demographic expansions, as well as government spending, is associated with an improvement in international relative prices and firms' entry. While trade liberalization may result in a smaller array of goods available to consumers, efficiency gains from deeper economic integration benefit consumers via lower goods prices. The international transmission mechanism and the welfare spillovers vary under different asset market structures, depending on trade costs, the elasticity of labor supply, and consumers' taste for varieties.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Corsetti, Giancarlo & Martin, Philippe & Pesenti, Paolo, 2007.

Journal of International Economics,Making sense of Bolkestein-bashing: Trade liberalization under segmented labor markets,"['Saint-Paul, Gilles']","Trade liberalization is often met with sharp opposition. Recent examples include the so-called ""Bolkestein"" directive, which allows service providers from a given EU member to temporarily work in another member country. One way to view such a reform is that it simply widens the range of goods that are tradeable. This kind of reform is analyzed in a two-country Dornbusch-Fischer-Samuelson style model, where labor cannot relocate to another sector upon a non expected increase in the range of goods that can be traded. The effect of liberalization on the terms of trade tends to favor the poorer country (the ""East""), if (as assumed) the most sophisticated goods are tradeable before reform. Second, under ex-post liberalization, there exists a class of workers in the West who are harmed because they face competition from Eastern workers and cannot relocate to other activities. But if the East's economy is relatively small, their wage losses are not very large. Things are different, however, if there exist asymmetries in labor market institutions, such that upon reform, labor can relocate in the East but not in the West. Some workers in the West can then experience very large wage losses. Thus, rigid labor markets in the West magnify opposition to reform there.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Saint-Paul, Gilles, 2007.

We consider a general n-country model in which countries trade differentiated industrial commodities as well as a numeraire good. Countries may be different in the size of the industrial good industry (measure of firms) and the market size (population size). Their incentives to sign an FTA depend on these characteristics of their own countries and those of their partner countries. We show that if all countries are symmetric, a complete global free trade network is pairwise stable and it is the unique stable network if industrial commodities are not highly substitutable. We also compare FTAs and customs unions (CUs) as to which of these two regimes facilitate global trade liberalization, emphasizing the fact that unlike in the case of a CU, each country signing an FTA can have a new FTA with an outside country without consent of other member countries.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Furusawa, Taiji & Konishi, Hideo, 2007.

Firms constantly involved in international tradethroughout the period experience higher job destruction rates, or lower job creation rates, than thosethat are not. The same firms also contribute massively to the observed decrease in the share ofproduction labor in overall employment, and to the decrease in the share of unskilled workers inproduction labor. However, the firms constantly involved in international trade through imports orexports turn out unsurprisingly to be the biggest firms. A simple analysis based on creation anddestruction rates therefore fails to disentangle the size and international trade effects.An analysis of variance of the link between changes in flows of international trade and changes in ourmeasures of firm employment, conditional on size as well as industry affiliation, shows that increasingimports are associated to decreasing employment. In particular, imports of so-called ""finished goods"",capturing the outsourcing abroad of part of the firm’s local production activities, have the strongestrelationship with the decrease in total employment, as well as (unskilled) production employment. Onthe other hand, exports tend to be associated with job creation, although this result depends on thenature of the exported product.

The impact has, however, been uneven. GATT/WTO membership for industrial countries has been associated with a large increase in imports estimated at about 40 percent of world trade. The same has not been true for developing country members, although those that joined after the Uruguay Round have benefited from increased imports. Similarly, there have been asymmetric effects among sectors, with WTO membership associated with substantially greater imports in sectors where barriers are low. These results are consistent with the history and design of the institution, which presided over significant trade liberalization by the industrial countries except in sectors such as food and clothing; largely exempted developing countries from the obligations to liberalize under the principle of special and differential treatment; but attempted to redress the latter by imposing greater obligations on developing country members that joined after the Uruguay Round.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Subramanian, Arvind & Wei, Shang-Jin, 2007.

Journal of International Economics,Trade deflection and trade depression,"['Bown, Chad P.', 'Crowley, Meredith A.']",This is the first paper to empirically examine whether the United States' imposition of a special import restraint distorts foreign exports and thus affects world trade flows. We first develop a theoretical model of worldwide trade in which the imposition of a special import restraint by one country - an antidumping duty or a safeguard measure - causes significant distortions in world trade flows. We then empirically test this model by investigating the effect of US special import restraints on Japanese exports of roughly 3500 commodities into 29 countries between 1992 and 2001. Our estimation of a fixed-effects model of Japanese exports yields evidence that US import restraints both deflect and depress Japanese export flows. Imposition of a US antidumping duty against Japan deflects trade: export growth to non-US trading partners rises by 11 to 22 percentage points. The simultaneous imposition of a US antidumping duty against both Japan and a third country depresses trade: Japanese export growth to the third country falls by 0 to 18 percentage points. The magnitude of the trade depression effect is also larger when the US imposes an antidumping duty against a third country but not against Japan. A US safeguard measure leads Japanese export growth to third countries to rise 12 to 15 percentage points.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.),"Bown, Chad P. & Crowley, Meredith A., 2007.

Journal of International Economics,Financial liberalization and banking crises in emerging economies,"['Daniel, Betty C.', 'Jones, John Bailey']","In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation of why financial liberalization is likely to generate financial crises in emerging market economies. We first show that under financial repression the aggregate capital stock and bank net worth are both likely to be low. This leads a newly liberalized bank to be highly levered, because the marginal product of capital---and thus loan interest rates---are high. The high returns on capital, however, also make default unlikely, and they encourage the bank to retain all of its earnings. As the bank's net worth grows, aggregate capital rises, the marginal product of capital falls and a banking crisis becomes more likely. Although the bank faces conflicting incentives toward risk-taking, as net worth continues to grow the bank will become increasingly cautious. Numerical results suggest that the bank will reduce its risk, by reducing its leverage, before issuing dividends. We also find that government bailouts, which allow defaulting banks to continue running, induce significantly more risk-taking than the liability limits associated with standard bankruptcy.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Daniel, Betty C. & Jones, John Bailey, 2007.

Journal of International Economics,One cost of the Chilean capital controls: Increased financial constraints for smaller traded firms,"['Forbes, Kristin J.']"," There is growing support for taxes on short-term capital inflows in emerging markets, such as the encaje adopted by Chile from 1991-98. Previous empirical assessments of the encaje conclude that it may have generated some small economic benefits, such as shifting the composition of capital inflows to a longer maturity, but no significant economic costs. Managers of small and medium-sized companies in Chile, however, claim that the encaje made it substantially more difficult to obtain financing for productive investment. This paper assesses whether the Chilean capital controls increased financial constraints for different-sized, publicly traded firms. It uses two different testing methodologies: a Tobin's-q and Euler-equation framework. Results indicate that during the encaje, smaller traded firms in Chile experienced significant financial constraints and these constraints decreased as firm size increased. Both before and after the encaje, however, no group of traded firms experienced significant financial constraints, and there is no relationship between firm size and financial constraints. Although Chilean-style capital controls may also have significant benefits, this cost of the encaje could be particularly important in emerging markets where smaller firms are valuable sources of job creation and economic growth(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Forbes, Kristin J., 2007.

Journal of International Economics,Why parallel trade may raise producers' profits,"['Raff, Horst', 'Schmitt, Nicolas']","This paper shows that a manufacturer may benefit from parallel trade. In addition to an intuitive condition about the effect of demand shocks, this occurs when competitive retailers must order inventories before they know the realization of demand and for products whose sale value drops at the end of the demand period. For these types of products, letting retailers trade unsold inventories generally results in larger orders placed with the manufacturer, higher manufacturer profit and higher consumer surplus. The model provides a simple explanation as to why the volume of parallel trade is now very large and accepted by manufacturers for some products such as automobiles, clothes, toys, consumer electronics, musical recordings, cosmetics and perfumes.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Raff, Horst & Schmitt, Nicolas, 2007.

Journal of International Economics,Trade liberalization and rising wage inequality in Latin America: Reconciliation with HOS theory,"['Atolia, Manoj']","The paper puts forward the hypothesis that transitory effects of trade liberalization on wage inequality can differ from the long-run outcome based on the HOS theory. In cases where HOS theory predicts a decline in wage inequality in the long run, a temporary rise can occur due to (i) asymmetries in the speed of contraction in the import sector and expansion in other sectors, and (ii) capital-skill complementarity in production. Asymmetric contraction and expansion causes transitory capital accumulation that boosts the relative and the real wage of the skilled labor due to capital-skill complementarity. Although long-run HOS fundamentals are, therefore, dominated in short run by the transient effects arising due to capital-skill complementarity, the observed rise in wage inequality is, nevertheless, consistent with the HOS theory appropriately extended to a dynamic setting.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Atolia, Manoj, 2007.

Journal of International Economics,Trade intensity and business cycle synchronization: Are developing countries any different?,"['Calderon, Cesar', 'Chong, Alberto', 'Stein, Ernesto']","Some key criteria in the optimal currency area literature are that countries should join a currency union if they have closer international trade links and more symmetric business cycles. However, both criteria are endogenous. Frankel and Rose (1998) find that trade intensity increases cycle correlation among industrial countries. We study whether the same result holds true for the case of developing countries, as their different patterns of international trade and specialization may lead to cyclical asymmetries among them and between industrial and developing countries. We gather annual information for 147 countries for 1960-99 (33,676 country pairs) and find: (i) countries with higher bilateral trade exhibit higher business cycle synchronization, with an increase of one standard deviation in bilateral trade intensity raising the output correlation from 0.05 to 0.09 for all country pairs; (ii) countries with more asymmetric structures of production exhibit a smaller business cycle correlation; (iii) the impact of trade integration on business cycles is higher for industrial countries than both developing and industrial-developing country pairs; (iv) a one standard deviation increase in bilateral trade intensity leads to surges in output correlation from 0.25 to 0.39 among industrial countries, from 0.08 to 0.10 for our sample of industrial-developing country pairs, and from 0.03 to 0.06 among developing countries; (v) the impact of trade intensity on cycle correlation is smaller the greater the production structure asymmetries between the countries.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Calderon, Cesar & Chong, Alberto & Stein, Ernesto, 2007.

Providing different instruments for both endogenous variables, we show that a 10% increase in bilateral trade raises bilateral asset holdings by 6% to 7%.

Journal of International Economics,"Trade policy, trade volumes and plant-level productivity in Colombian manufacturing industries","['Fernandes, Ana M.']","This paper offers new insights on a central question in trade and development economics: does increased exposure to foreign competition generate gains in plant productivity? We find that it does. We examine Colombian trade policy from 1977 to 1991, a period during which trade liberalization alternates with increased trade protection in varied ways across industries, to investigate the link between trade policy and plant productivity. Using a rich panel of manufacturing plants, we obtain production function estimates separately across industries that are consistent in face of the simultaneity between input demands and productivity. These estimates are used to derive plant-level time-varying productivity measures for which a systematic component related to trade policy is identified. We find a strong negative impact of nominal tariffs on plant productivity controlling for observed and unobserved plant characteristics and industry heterogeneity. The use of lagged tariffs and the evidence on the political economy of tariff determination in Colombia allow us to argue that the negative impact of tariffs is unlikely to reflect the endogeneity of protection. Plant exit plays a minor role in generating productivity gains in face of lower trade protection. Also, accounting for variation in the Colombian peso's real exchange rate does not weaken the main findings. The negative impact of trade protection on productivity is stronger for large plants relative to small plants, as measured by employment and market shares. The negative impact of trade protection on productivity is stronger for plants in less competitive industries according to Herfindahl indexes and turnover rates. The main findings are robust to the use of effective rates of protection and import penetration ratios as measures of trade protection and openness. Finally, we also find evidence of a negative impact of trade protection on the rate of growth of plant productivity.

However, the gravity equation is subject to the same econometric critique as earlier cross-industry studies of U.S. tariff and nontariff barriers and U.S. multilateral imports: Trade policy is not an exogenous variable. The authors address econometrically the endogeneity of FTAs using instrumental-variable (IV) techniques, control-function (CF) techniques, and panel-data techniques; IV and CF approaches do not adjust for endogeneity well, but a panel-data approach does.

Journal of International Economics,Global monetary policy under a dollar standard,"['Devereux, Michael B.', 'Shi, Kang', 'Xu, Juanyi']","For the past four or five decades, the international monetary system has operated on a ’dollar standard’. Popular discussion suggests that this gives the US an advantage in the use of monetary policy. This Paper analyses the determination of monetary policy in a world with a dollar standard, defined here as a environment in which all traded goods prices are set in US dollars. This generates an asymmetry whereby exchange rate pass-through into the US CPI is zero, while pass-through to other countries will be positive. We show that monetary policy in such a setting does seem to accord with popular discussion. In particular, the US is essentially indifferent to exchange rate volatility in setting monetary policy, while the rest of the world places a high weight on exchange rate volatility. More importantly, in a Nash equilibrium of the monetary policy game between the US and the rest of the world, the preferences of the US dominate. That is, the equilibrium is identical to one where the US alone chooses world monetary policy. Despite this, we find surprisingly that the US loses from the dollar’s role as an international currency. Even though US preferences dominate world monetary policy, the absence of exchange rate pass-through means that US consumers are worse off than those in the rest of the world, where exchange rate pass-through operates efficiently. Finally, we derive the conditions for a dollar standard to exist.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Devereux, Michael B. & Shi, Kang & Xu, Juanyi, 2007.

Journal of International Economics,Fixed exchange rates and trade,"['Klein, Michael W.', 'Shambaugh, Jay C.']","A classic argument for a fixed exchange rate is its promotion of trade. Empirical support for this, however, is mixed. While one branch of research consistently shows a small negative effect of exchange rate volatility on trade, another, more recent, branch presents evidence of a large positive impact of currency unions on trade. This paper helps resolve this disconnect. Our results, which use a new data-based classification of fixed exchange rate regimes, show a large, significant effect of a fixed exchange rate on bilateral trade between a base country and a country that pegs to it. Furthermore, the web of fixed exchange rates created when countries link to a common base also promotes trade, but only when these countries are part of a wider system, as during the Bretton Woods period. These results suggest an economically relevant role for exchange rate regimes in trade determination since a significant amount of world trade is conducted between countries with fixed exchange rates.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Klein, Michael W. & Shambaugh, Jay C., 2006.

Journal of International Economics,Macroeconomic interdependence under incomplete markets,"['Ghironi, Fabio']"," I develop a tractable, two-country, real model of macroeconomic interdependence with a role for net foreign asset dynamics. Absence of Ricardian equivalence in an overlapping generations structure ensures existence of a well-defined, endogenously determined, steady-state, international distribution of asset holdings, to which the world economy returns following temporary shocks. The model offers a plausible explanation for the failure of statistical tests to reject the hypothesis of a unit root in series of net foreign assets. Model dynamics after productivity shocks are significantly different from those of a setup in which net foreign assets do not move after shocks, such as Corsetti and Pesenti's (2001a) model. The difference relative to a complete markets economy in which net foreign asset movements play no role in shock transmission is smaller. It is amplified if the substitutability across goods rises, if shocks are permanent, and if steady-state net foreign assets are not zero.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Ghironi, Fabio, 2006.

Journal of International Economics,Subsidizing rent-seeking: Antidumping protection and the Byrd Amendment,"['Reynolds, Kara M.']","Theoretical comparisons of the welfare consequences of tariffs, subsidies and import licenses have relied on the assumption that firms reap no private benefits from the imposition of a tariff. This paper conducts an empirical analysis of whether a recent change in U.S. antidumping law known as the Byrd Amendment bestows private benefits to firms lobbying for tariff protection and, thus, increases the level of rent-seeking in the United States. The results provide strong evidence that industries have chosen to lobby for more tariff protection, or filed more antidumping petitions, since passage of the Byrd Amendment. However, there is less evidence that the number of firms filing these petitions increased under the law. This suggests that the Byrd Amendment only partially alleviates the incentive to free-ride.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Reynolds, Kara M., 2006.

Is it worthwhile to implement policies designed to increase competition in transport markets? Focusing on air transport, this paper quantifies the effects of liberalization of air cargo markets on transport costs. Between 1990 and 2003, the United States implemented a series of Open Skies Agreements, providing a unique opportunity to assess the effect that a change in the competition regime has on prices. In our sample, Open Skies Agreements reduce air transport costs by 9% and increase by 7% the share of imports arriving by air. Those results hold for developed and upper-middle-income developing countries but for lower-middle-income and low-income developing countries Open Skies Agreements do not reduce.

Journal of International Economics,Quantitative implications of a debt-deflation theory of Sudden Stops and asset prices,"['Mendoza, Enrique G.', 'Smith, Katherine A.']","This paper shows that the quantitative predictions of an equilibrium asset pricing model with financial frictions are consistent with the large consumption and current-account reversals and asset-price collapses observed in the ""Sudden Stops"" of emerging markets crises. Margin requirements set a collateral constraint on foreign borrowing by domestic agents. Foreign traders incur costs in trading assets with domestic agents. Margin constraints bind occasionally depending on equilibrium portfolios and asset prices. When the constraints do not bind, productivity shocks cause standard real-business-cycle effects. When the constraints bind, shocks of the same magnitude cause strikingly different effects that vary with the leverage ratio and the liquidity of asset markets. With high leverage and liquid markets, the shocks trigger margin calls forcing ""fire sales"" of assets. Fisher's debt-deflation mechanism causes subsequent rounds of margin calls, a fall in asset prices and large consumption and current account reversals. The size of the price decline depends on trading costs parameters because these parameters determine the price elasticity of the foreign traders' asset demand function. Price declines of the magnitude observed in the data require a less-than-unitary price elasticity. Precautionary saving makes Sudden Stops infrequent in the long run so that the model can explain both regular business cycles and the unusually large reversals of consumption and current accounts associated with Sudden Stops.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Mendoza, Enrique G. & Smith, Katherine A., 2006.

Journal of International Economics,Using survey data to assess the distributional effects of trade policy,"['Porto, Guido G.']","The author develops and applies a methodology to empirically explore the effects of trade policies on the distribution of income and poverty in developing countries. He uses a methodology based on two links-one connecting trade policies to prices, and another connecting prices to household welfare. The author applies the methodology to the study of the distributional effects of Mercosur on Argentine families. The main finding is that Mercosur benefits the average Argentine household across the entire income distribution. There is evidence of a pro-poor bias of the regional trade agreement: on average, poor households gain more from the reform than middle-income households, whereas the effects on rich families are positive but not statistically significant. Prior to the reform, Argentine trade policy protected the rich over the poor, and after the reform, granted some protection to the poor. As relative pre-Mercosur tariffs are higher on relatively skill-intensive goods, the tariff removals tend to benefit the poor over the rich. These findings indicate that trade reforms may actually help improve the distribution of income and reduce poverty in the country.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Porto, Guido G., 2006.

Such an arrangement is inferior to an optimal inflation targeting, or a Rogoff-style central banker, whose optimal degree of conservatism is proportional to the quality of institutions.

Journal of International Economics,An information-based trade off between foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment,"['Goldstein, Itay', 'Razin, Assaf']","The paper develops a model of foreign direct investments (FDI) and foreign portfolio investments (FPI).The model describes an information-based trade off between direct investments and portfolio investments. Direct investors are more informed about the fundamentals of their projects. This information enables them to manage their projects more efficiently. However, it also creates an asymmetric-information problem in case they need to sell their projects prematurely, and reduces the price they can get in that case. As a result, investors, who know they are more likely to get a liquidity shock that forces them to sell early, are more likely to choose portfolio investments, whereas investors, who know they are less likely to get a liquidity shock, are more likely to choose direct investments. FDI is characterized by hands-on management style which enables the owner to obtain relatively refined information about the productivity of the firm. This superiority of FDI relative to FPI, comes with a cost: a firm owned by the relatively well-informed FDI investor has a low resale price because of a ""lemons"" type asymmetric information between the owner and potential buyers. The model can explain several stylized facts regarding foreign equity flows, such as the larger ratio of FDI to FPI inflows in developing countries relative to developed countries, and the greater volatility of FDI net inflows relative to FPI net inflows.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Goldstein, Itay & Razin, Assaf, 2006.

While the government's desire to redistribute income itself is dependent on asset distribution, it is to a large extent also driven by the partisan nature of the government, i.e., whether it is pro-labor or pro-capital. Using cross-country data on factor endowments, inequality and government orientation, we find that, conditional on inequality, left-wing (pro-labor) governments will adopt more protectionist trade policies in capital-rich countries, but adopt more pro-trade policies in labor-rich economies than right-wing (pro-capital) ones. Also, holding government orientation constant, higher inequality is associated with higher protection in capital-abundant countries while it is associated with lower protection in labor-abundant countries. These results are consistent with the simultaneous presence of both inequality as well as ideology as determinants of protection within a two-factor, two-sector Heckscher–Ohlin framework. Overall, various statistical tests support an umbrella model (that combines both the ideology and inequality models) over each of the individual models.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Dutt, Pushan & Mitra, Devashish, 2006.

In this setting, economic integration does not reduce the revenue raising capacity of governments and thus does not lead to a race-to-the- bottom in social standards. Instead, trade and capital flows interact with welfare state policies in increasing welfare even when each government acts independently (non-cooperatively) in determining its optimal welfare payment.

Journal of International Economics,Country spreads and emerging countries: Who drives whom?,"['Uribe, Martin', 'Yue, Vivian Z.']","A number of studies have stressed the role of movements in US interest rates and country spreads in driving business cycles in emerging market economies. At the same time, country spreads have been found to respond to changes in both the US interest rate and domestic conditions in emerging markets. These intricate interrelationships leave open a number of fundamental questions: Do country spreads drive business cycles in emerging countries or vice versa, or both? Do US interest rates affect emerging countries directly or primarily through their effect on country spreads? This paper addresses these and other related questions using a methodology that combines empirical and theoretical elements. The main findings are: (1) US interest rate shocks explain about 20 percent of movements in aggregate activity in emerging market economies at business-cycle frequency. (2) Country spread shocks explain about 12 percent of business-cycle movements in emerging economies. (3) About 60 percent of movements in country spreads are explained by country-spread shocks. (4) In response to an increase in US interest rates, country spreads first fall and then display a large, delayed overshooting; (5) US-interest-rate shocks affect domestic variables mostly through their effects on country spreads. (6) The fact that country spreads respond to business conditions in emerging economies significantly exacerbates aggregate volatility in these countries. (7) The US-interest-rate shocks and country-spread shocks identified in this paper are plausible in the sense that they imply similar business cycles in the context of an empirical VAR model as they do in the context of a theoretical dynamic general equilibrium model of an emerging market economy.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Uribe, Martin & Yue, Vivian Z., 2006.

Journal of International Economics,External currency pricing and the East Asian crisis,"['Cook, David', 'Devereux, Michael B.']","This Paper provides a quantitative investigation of the East Asian crisis of 1997-99. There are two essential features of the crisis that we focus on. These are: a) the crisis was a regional phenomenon; the depth and severity of the crisis was exacerbated by a large decline in regional demand; and b) the practice of setting export goods prices in dollars (which we document empirically) led to a powerful internal propagation effect of the crisis within the region, contributing greatly to the decline in regional trade flows. We construct a multicountry macroeconomic model with these two features, and show that it can do a reasonable job of accounting for the response of the main macroeconomic aggregates in Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand during the crisis. Without the regional dimension and dollar pricing of exports, the model fails to account for the depth and severity of the crisis.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Cook, David & Devereux, Michael B., 2006.

That is, emerging markets on average borrow more in good times and at lower interest rates as compared to slumps.

Journal of International Economics,Are asset price guarantees useful for preventing Sudden Stops?: A quantitative investigation of the globalization hazard-moral hazard tradeoff,"['Durdu, Ceyhun Bora', 'Mendoza, Enrique G.']","The globalization hazard hypothesis maintains that the current account reversals and asset price collapses observed during 'Sudden Stops' are caused by global capital market frictions. A policy implication of this view is that Sudden Stops can be prevented by offering global investors price guarantees on emerging markets assets. These guarantees, however, introduce a moral hazard incentive for global investors, thus creating a tradeoff by which price guarantees weaken globalization hazard but strengthen international moral hazard. This paper studies the quantitative implications of this tradeoff using a dynamic stochastic equilibrium asset-pricing model. Without guarantees, distortions induced by margin calls and trading costs cause Sudden Stops driven by Fisher's debt-deflation mechanism. Price guarantees prevent this deflation by introducing a distortion that props up foreign demand for assets. Non-state-contingent guarantees contain Sudden Stops but they are executed often and induce persistent asset overvaluation. Guarantees offered only in high-debt states are executed rarely and prevent Sudden Stops without persistent asset overvaluation. If the elasticity of foreign asset demand is low, price guarantees can still contain Sudden Stops but domestic agents obtain smaller welfare gains at Sudden Stop states and suffer welfare losses on average in the stochastic steady state.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Durdu, Ceyhun Bora & Mendoza, Enrique G., 2006.

We reexamine this relationship in the context of globalization?a term typically used to describe the phenomenon of growing international trade and financial integration that has intensified since the mid-1980s. We employ various econometric techniques and a comprehensive new dataset to analyze the link between growth and volatility. Our findings suggest that, while the basic negative association between growth and volatility has been preserved during the 1990s, both trade and financial integration attenuate this negative relationship. Specifically, countries that are more open to trade appear to face a less severe tradeoff between growth and volatility.

The paper first presents a simple model examining how heterogeneous changes in investors' risk aversion affects portfolio decisions and stock prices. Second, the paper shows empirically that, when funds' returns are below average, they adjust their holdings toward the average (or benchmark) portfolio. In other words, they tend to sell the assets of countries in which they were ""overweight"", increasing their exposure to countries in which they were ""underweight."" Based on this insight, the paper discusses a matrix of financial interdependence reflecting the extent to which countries share overexposed funds.

We simulate the effects of increased goods market integration under two asset market structures, complete markets and international financial autarky. Our main finding is that under both asset market structures the model can generate stronger correlations for pairs of countries that trade more, but the increased correlation falls far short of the empirical findings. Even when we control for the fact that most country-pairs are small with respect to the rest of the world, the model continues to fall short. We also conduct additional simulations that allow for increased trade with the third country or increased TFP shock comovement to affect the country pair's business cycle comovement.

We extend the results of Benigno (2003) in two ways. First, we show that, if the degree of competition differs across countries, the optimal rule could involve a larger weight on the more ""flexible"" country. Second, we allow for a non-unitelastic demand for import. We show that this can alter Benigno's results even under asymmetric degree of competition.

In contrast, a broadly-applied tariff like a safeguard can accelerate technology adoption by a domestic import-competing firm, but will slow-down technology adoption by foreign exporting firms.

Trade liberalisation typically increases trade union technology opposition. These conclusions are reached in a model of international duopoly with monopoly wage setting in one of the countries, and two-way trade. An important stepping stone for the result is to note that even though trade liberalisation means a tougher competitive environment for firms, labour demand tends to increase.

MNFs manipulate transfer prices as a means to shift profits from high to low tax countries. National governments may hinder such a behavior by monitoring the MNF's accounts. We show that a country may optimally decide not to monitor the MNF for two different reasons. On the one hand, that makes it anattractive location for the MFN even if the corporate tax is high. On the other hand, not monitoring increases the mobility of the MFN's profits. This shifts the focus of tax competition in that corporate taxation then influences not only the MNF's location as the place where it declares its profits.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another ver(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Peralta, Susana & Wauthy, Xavier & van Ypersele, Tanguy, 2006.

Journal of International Economics,International trade and child labor: Cross-country evidence,"['Edmonds, Eric V.', 'Pavcnik, Nina']","We explore the relationship between greater exposure to trade (as measured by openness) and child labour in a cross-country setting. Our methodology accounts for the fact that trade flows are endogenous to child labour (and labour standards more generally) by examining the relationship between child labour and variation in trade based on geography. We find that countries that trade more have less child labour. At the cross-country means, the data suggest an openness elasticity of child labour of -0.7. For low-income countries, the elasticity of child labour with respect to trade with high-income countries is -0.9. These relationships appear to be largely attributable to the positive association between trade and income. When we control for the endogeneity of trade and for cross-country income differences, the openness elasticity of child labour at cross-country means is much smaller (-0.1) and statistically insignificant. We consistently find a negative but statistically insignificant association between openness and child labour conditional on cross-country income differences when we split the sample into different country groups, consider only trade between high and low income countries, or focus on exports of unskilled-labour intensive products from low income countries. Thus, the cross-country data do not substantiate assertions that trade per se plays a significant role in perpetuating the high levels of child labour that pervade low-income countries.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Edmonds, Eric V. & Pavcnik, Nina, 2006.

Journal of International Economics,Exchange rate exposure,"['Dominguez, Kathryn M.E.', 'Tesar, Linda L.']","In this paper we examine the relationship between exchange rate movements and firm value. We estimate the exchange rate exposure of publicly listed firms in a sample of eight (non-US) industrialized and emerging markets, and find that a significant percentage of these firms are indeed exposed. These results differ substantially from most previous studies in the literature that find little evidence of exposure. In robustness checks we find that: (i) the choice of exchange rate matters, and using the trade-weighted exchange rate is likely to understate the extent of exposure, (ii) conditioning on the value-weighted vs. the equally-weighted market index has little effect on estimated exposure, while conditioning on the international index does change the estimate of exposure, (iii) the extent of exposure is not a result of a spurious correlation between random variables with high variances, (iv) exposure increases with the return horizon, (v) within a country and within an industry, exposure coefficients are roughly evenly split between positive and negative values, (vi) averaging across the (absolute value of the) significant exposure coefficients in our sample of countries, we find an exposure coefficient of about 0.5, (vii) the extent of exposure is not sensitive to the sample period, but the set of firms that is exposed does vary over time, and (viii) the sign of the exposure coefficients changes across subperiods for about half of the firms of our sample.

Results demonstrate that plant survival as well as output and employment growth are negatively associated with the share of industry imports sourced from the world ¿s lowest-wage countries. Within industries, activity is reallocated towards capital- intensive plants. Plants are also more likely to alter their product mix (i.e. switch industries) in response to trade with low-wage countries.

The \""New Open Economy Macroeconomics\"" literature has investigated the implications of nominal rigidities in an open economy context and found that the currency in which prices are set has significant macroeconomic and policy implications. In this paper we solve for the optimal invoicing choice by integrating this microeconomic decision at the firm level into a general equilibrium open economy model. Strategic interactions between firms play a critical role in the analysis. We find that the less competition firms face in foreign markets, as reflected in market share and product differentiation, the more likely they will price in their own currency.

In this paper, we focus on the interactions between monetary and fiscal policy in a micro-founded model of a monetary union.

Journal of International Economics,Exporting raises productivity in sub-Saharan African manufacturing firms,"['Van Biesebroeck, Johannes']","Proponents of trade liberalization argue that it will force firms to produce closer to the production possibility frontier and that the frontier will move out faster. In particular, plants that export will achieve a higher productivity level. However intuitive the argument, empirical evidence is meager. This hypothesis is examined by calculating the effect of export status on productivity for a panel of manufacturing plants in nine African countries. The results indicate that exporters in these countries are more productive, replicating a similar finding for developed countries. More importantly, exporters increase their productivity advantage after entry into the export market. While the first finding can be explained by selection---only the most productive firms engage in exporting---the latter cannot. The results are robust when unobserved productivity differences and self-selection into the export market are controlled for using different econometric methods. Scale economies are shown to be an important channel for the productivity advance. Credit constraints and contract enforcement problems prevent plants that only produce for the domestic market to fully exploit scale economies.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Van Biesebroeck, Johannes, 2005.

Journal of International Economics,Assessing the impact of communication costs on international trade,"['Fink, Carsten', 'Mattoo, Aaditya', 'Neagu, Ileana Cristina']","Recent research suggests that trade costs influence the pattern of specialization and trade, but there is limited empirical research on the determinants of trade costs. The existing literature identifies a range of barriers that separate nations, but then typically focuses only on transport costs. Although communication costs figure prominently in intuitive explanations and casual observations, they have played little role in the formal analysis of trade costs. The authors seek to examine whether this neglect matters, and whether the inclusion of the magnitude and variation of communication costs across partner countries can add value to existing explanations of the pattern of trade. The authors develop a simple multi-sector model of""impeded""trade that generates hypotheses in a gravity-type estimation framework. The main proxies for bilateral communication costs are the per-minute country-to-country calling prices charged in the importing and exporting countries. The use of bilateral variations in prices yields estimates that are superior to the ones obtained from country-specific measures of communication infrastructure used in previous studies. The authors find that international variations in communication costs have a significant influence on bilateral trade flows, at the aggregate level and for most individual sectors disaggregated according to the 2-digit SITC classification. Since information and communication needs are likely to be much greater for differentiated goods, the authors test whether trade in these products is more sensitive to variations in the costs of communication. Using the Rauch classification of product heterogeneity, the estimates suggest that the impact of communication costs on trade in differentiated products is as much as one-third larger than on trade in homogenous products. Finally, the authors verify, to the extent possible, that the significance of communication costs is not driven by their endogeneity or by omitted varia(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Fink, Carsten & Mattoo, Aaditya & Neagu, Ileana Cristina, 2005.

Competition reduces state taxes and thus the need for federal subsidies. Also, under competition, the firm locates in the nation’s preferred location. Therefore, tax competition offers two means of increasing national welfare, indicating that it is not a simple prisoner’s dilemma.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Davies, Ronald B., 2005.

First, I estimate a simple market-potential function, which is a reduced form for several economic geography models. This specification resembles a spatial labor demand function, as it is proximity to consumer markets that determines nominal wages and employment in a given location. The estimation results indicate how far demand linkages extend across space and how income shocks in one location affect other locations. Second, I estimate a more elaborate market-potential function derived from the Krugman model of economic geography.

Journal of International Economics,International versus domestic auditing of bank solvency,"['Feltenstein, Andrew', 'Lagunoff, Roger']","This paper examines alternative ways to prevent losses from bank insolvencies. It is widely viewed that transparency in reporting bank balance sheets is a key element in reducing such losses. It is, however, unclear just how such transparency would be achieved. Current approaches to avoiding insolvencies generally involve international enforcement mechanisms. Among these are the sovereign debt restructuring mechanism (SDRM), and, more generally, an international bankruptcy court. We develop a model that compares two alternative institutions for bank auditing. Neither of these institutions would require as much enforcement capability as an international bankruptcy court, hence they would be easier to introduce. The first of these is a system of central bank auditing of national banks. The second type of auditing is carried out by an international agency that collects risk information on banks in all countries and then provides it to depositors. Using a game- theoretic approach, we compare the informativeness of the disclosure rule in the symmetric Perfect Bayesian equilibrium in each of the two different auditing institutions. We show that the international auditor generally performs at least as well, and sometimes better than, auditing by either central banks, which, in turn, perform better than voluntary disclosure by the banks themselves. The results do not assume any informational advantages of the international auditor, nor is the international auditor somehow less ""corrupt"" than the central banks. Rather, the international auditor's credibility comes from the simple fact that its incentives are not distorted by a sovereignty bias that plagues the central banks.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Feltenstein, Andrew & Lagunoff, Roger, 2005.

Journal of International Economics,A macroeconomic model of international price discrimination,"['Corsetti, Giancarlo', 'Dedola, Luca']","This Paper builds a baseline two-country model of real and monetary transmission in the presence of optimal international price discrimination by firms. Distributing traded goods to consumers requires non-tradables, intensive in local labour. Because of distributive trade the price elasticity of demand depends on country-specific shocks to productivity and the exchange rate. Hence, within limits dictated by the possibility of arbitrage, profit-maximizing monopolistic firms drive a wedge between prices across countries at both wholesale and retail level. Optimal pricing thus results in possibly large deviations from the law of one price and incomplete pass-through on import prices. Consistent with the received wisdom on international transmission, nominal and real depreciations worsens the terms of trade. In general, the nominal and real exchange rate are more volatile than fundamentals, and large movements in the international prices translate into small changes in consumption, employment and the price level. Finally, we provide an example showing that international policy cooperation may be redundant even when asset trading is ruled out, despite incomplete pass-through and less than optimal risk sharing.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Corsetti, Giancarlo & Dedola, Luca, 2005.

We analyze this question in the context of self-enforcing agreements. We show that if the two policies are independent in the government's objective function then linkage -- the ability to use both policies to punish non- compliance in either individual agreement -- promotes cooperation in one policy at the expense of the other (e.g. strengthens environmental standards at the expense of higher tariffs). However, if the linked policies are not independent in the governments' objective function (e.g. a tariff on cars and an environmental tax on oil) and if these policies are strategic complements then linkage promotes more cooperation in both issues (higher environmental standards and lower tariffs) than no-linkage. The policies are strategic complements only if: (i) the production externality has cross-border effects; (ii) the weight on the externality cost is high; (iii) import competing lobbies are not “powerful''.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Limao, Nuno, 2005.

Using a large cross-country time-series data set, the authors evaluate the dependence of foreign direct investment on global factors or worldwide sources of risk (that is, factors that drive foreign direct investment across several countries). They construct a globalization measure that equals the share of explained variation in direct investment attributable to global factors. The authors show that the globalization measure has increased steadily for industrial and developing countries. For the full sample of countries, the globalization measure rose eightfold from 1985 to 1999. Furthermore, in recent years developing countries'exposure to global factors has approached that of industrial countries, particularly for Latin America. Finally, the globalization measure correlates strongly with measures of capital market liberalization. Overall the authors find strong support for the hypothesis of increased market integration which implies a greater role for worldwide sources of risk.

While prior research has generally evaluated exchange rate forecasts using conventional statistical measures of forecast accuracy, in this Paper we investigate whether there is any economic value to the predictive power of monetary fundamentals for the exchange rate. We estimate, using a framework that allows for parameter uncertainty, the economic and utility gains to an investor who manages a portfolio based on exchange rate forecasts from a monetary fundamentals model.

The size of this risk premium may shrink to zero over sufficiently small intervals of time. In contrast, because no interest is paid on intradaily positions and interest is instead paid discretely at the point when a position is rolled over from one day to the next, the size of the interest differential remains fixed over any interval that covers the time of the discrete interest payment. This is true no matter how short that interval is. Using a large dataset of high frequency exchange rate data, we run uncovered interest parity regressions over different time intervals. We replicate the rejection of the uncovered interest parity hypothesis with daily data, but find results that are consistently much more supportive of the uncovered interest parity hypothesis over short windows of intradaily data that span the time of the discrete interest payment.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Chaboud, Alain P. & Wright, Jonathan H., 2005.

Chicago School arguments not withstanding, these Old-Keynesian models provided a theoretical rational for policy coordination. Now, a new generation of policy coordination models is emerging. These New-Keynesian models incorporate optimizing households, monopolistic competition and nominal inertia. Here, we examine macroeconomic interdependence and the scope for policy coordination in a tractable second generation model that has received much recent attention. We relate our discussion to the old Chicago School arguments, to earlier analyses of first generation models, to recent empirical work on productivity, and to recent theoretical work on closed economy models.

The increased competitiveness of product markets and greater access to foreign inputs, the argument goes, will lead to more elastic demand for workers. This may have adverse consequences for both labor market volatility and wage dispersion. The authors argue that while the case that trade liberalization should increase own-wage elasticities may be broadly compelling for competitive import-competing industries, it is less so for imperfectly competitive, nontradable, or export industries. They test the hypothesis using establishment-level panel data from three countries with periods of liberalization. The data provide only mixed support for the idea that trade liberalization has an impact on own-wage elasticities. No consistent patterns emerge.

Journal of International Economics,Informal export barriers and poverty,"['Porto, Guido G.']","The author investigates the poverty impacts of informal export barriers like transport costs, cumbersome customs practices, costly regulations, and bribes. He models these informal barriers as export taxes that distort the efficient allocation of resources. In low-income agricultural economies, this distortion lowers wages and household agricultural income, thereby leading to higher poverty. The author investigates the poverty impacts of improving export procedures in Moldova. This is a unique case study: poverty is widespread (half of the Moldovan population lives in poverty), the country is very open and relies on agricultural exports for growth, formal trade barriers are fairly liberalized, and informal export barriers are common and widespread. The author finds that improving export practices would benefit the average Moldovan household across the whole income distribution. For example, halving informal export barriers would cause poverty to decline from 48.3 percent of the population to between 43.3 and 45.5 percent, potentially lifting 100,000-180,000 individuals out of poverty.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Porto, Guido G., 2005.

In that model, the interest rate is the passive reflection of currency-depreciation expectations. In this paper we show how to adapt the KFG model to allow for an interest rate defense. It is shown that increasing the domestic-currency interest rate makes domestic assets more attractive according to an asset substitution effect, but weakens the domestic currency by increasing the government’s fiscal liabilities. As a result, raising the interest rate hastens the speculative attack when speculation is motivated by underlying fiscal fragility.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Flood, Robert P. & Jeanne, Olivier, 2005.

Journal of International Economics,"Trade, wages, and the political economy of trade protection: evidence from the Colombian trade reforms","['Goldberg, Pinelopi Koujianou', 'Pavcnik, Nina']","Worker industry affiliation plays a crucial role in how trade policy affects wages in many trade models. Yet, most research has focused on how trade policy affects wages by altering the economy-wide returns to a specific worker characteristic (i.e. skill or education) rather than through worker-industry affiliation. This Paper exploits drastic trade liberalizations in Colombia in the 1980s and 1990s to investigate the relationship between protection and industry wages. Using the Colombian National Household Survey we first compute industry wage premiums, adjusting for a series of worker, job, and firm characteristics. We find that Colombian industry wage premiums exhibit remarkably less persistence over time than US wage premiums. Similarly, tariffs are less correlated over time than in the US data, indicating that trade liberalization has changed the structure of protection. We next relate wage premiums to trade policy in a framework that accounts for the political economy of trade protection. Accounting for time-invariant political economy factors is critical. When we do not control for unobserved time-invariant industry characteristics, we find that workers in protected sectors earn less than workers with similar observable characteristics in unprotected sectors. Allowing for industry fixed effects reverses the result: trade protection increases relative wages. This positive relationship persists when we instrument for tariff changes. Our results are in line with short- and medium-run models of trade where labour is immobile across sectors, or, alternatively, with the existence of industry rents that are reduced by trade liberalization. In the context of the current debate on the rising income inequality in developing countries, our findings point to a source of disparity beyond the well-documented rise in the economy-wide skill premium: because tariff reductions were proportionately larger in sectors employing a high fraction of less-skilled workers, the decreas(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Goldberg, Pinelopi Koujianou & Pavcnik, Nina, 2005.

A number of interesting regularities emerge. When a country's costs rise, the share of U.S. overseas assembly activities in that location decline. Conversely, a country's share of U.S. overseas assembly activities grows when competitor country costs increase. While own and competitor country costs affect overseas assembly in all countries, the magnitude of these effects is larger for developing countries than it is for developed countries. In many cases, the measured responses to cost changes appear to correspond with outsourcing theories that are based on search and customization costs.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Swenson, Deborah L., 2005.

High turnover industries are similar to the Stolper- Samuelson assumption of perfect factor mobility, so factor of production drives trade preferences. Among low turnover industries, as in the specific factors model, net export position determines trade preferences. We show that PAC contribution patterns are consistent with this hypothesis. In high turnover industries, capital groups give significantly larger shares of their campaign contributions to free trade supporters than labor groups do. Among low turnover industries, on the other hand, exporting and import-competing groups differ significantly in their financial support for free traders.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Magee, Christopher S.P. & Davidson, Carl & Matusz, Steven J., 2005.

Journal of International Economics,When and how should infant industries be protected?,"['Melitz, Marc J.']","This paper develops and analyzes a welfare maximizing model of infant industry protection. The domestic infant industry is competitive and experiences dynamic learning effects that are external to firms. The competitive foreign industry is mature and produces a good that is an imperfect substitute for the domestic good. A government planner can protect the infant industry using domestic production subsidies, tariffs, or quotas in order to maximize domestic welfare over time. As protection is not always optimal (although the domestic industry experiences a learning externality), the paper shows how the decision to protect the industry should depend on the industry's learning potential, the shape of the learning curve, and the degree of substitutability between domestic and foreign goods. Assuming some reasonable restrictions on the flexibility over time of the policy instruments, the paper subsequently compares the effectiveness of the different instruments. Given such restrictions, the paper shows that quotas induce higher welfare levels than tariffs. In some cases, the dominance of the quota is so pronounced that it compensates for any amount of government revenue loss related to the administration of the quota (including the case of a voluntary export restraint, where no revenue is collected). In similar cases, the quota may even be preferred to a domestic production subsidy.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Melitz, Marc J., 2005.

Journal of International Economics,The determinants of cross-border equity flows,"['Portes, Richard', 'Rey, Helene']","We apply a new approach to a new panel data set on bilateral gross cross-border equity flows between 14 countries, 1989-96. The remarkably good results have strong implications for theories of asset trade. We find that the geography of information heavily determines the pattern of international transactions. Our model integrates elements of the finance literature on portfolio composition and the international macroeconomics and asset trade literature. Gross asset flows depend on market size in both source and destination country as well as trading costs, in which both information and the transaction technology play a role. The resulting augmented gravity' equation has equity market capitalisation representing market size and distance proxying some informational asymmetries, as well as a variable representing openness of each economy. But other variables explicitly represent information transmission (telephone call traffic and multinational bank branches), an information asymmetry between domestic and foreign investors (degree of insider trading), and the efficiency of transactions ( financial market sophistication'). This equation accounts for almost 70% of the variance of the transaction flows. Dummy variables (adjacency, language, currency or trade bloc, and a major financial centre' effect) do not improve the results, nor does a variable representing destination country stock market returns. The key role of informational asymmetries is confirmed. Our information transmission variables also substantially improve standard gravity equations for trade in goods.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Portes, Richard & Rey, Helene, 2005.

Two major principles for corporate taxation are Separate Accounting (SA) and Formula Apportionment (FA).

How are these dimensions to be interpreted? This paper seeks those answers in the context of voting on the landmark 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act. The paper takes steps beyond the existing literature. First, using a factor analytic approach, the dimension issue is examined to determine whether subsets of roll call votes on trade policy are correlated. A factor-analytic result allows the use of a limited number of votes for this purpose. Second, a structural model with latent variables is used to find what economic and political factors comprise these dimensions. The study yields two main findings. More than one dimension determines voting in the Senate, with the main dimension driven by economic interest, not ideology. Although two dimensions are required to fully account for House voting, one dimension dominates. That dimension is driven primarily by party. Based on reported evidence, and a growing consensus in the congressional studies literature, this finding is attributed to interest-based leadership that evolves in order to solve collective action problems faced by individual legislators.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Bohara, Alok K. & Camargo, Alejandro Islas & Grijalva, Therese & Gawande, Kishore, 2005.

We estimate a discrete choice, differentiated products demand system for wide-body aircraft and examine the Airbus-Boeing rivalry under various assumptions on firm conduct. We then use this structure to evaluate two trade disputes between the United States and European Union. Our results suggest that aircraft prices increased by about 3.7% after the 1992 US – EU agreement on trade in civil aircraft that limits subsidies. This price hike is consistent with a 5% increase in firms’ marginal costs after the subsidy cuts. We also simulate the impact of the future entry of the Airbus A-380 super-jumbo aircraft on the demand for other wide-bodied aircraft, notably the Boeing 747. We find that the A-380 could reduce the market share of the 747 by up to 14.8 percentage points in the long range wide-body market segment (depending upon the discounts offered on the A-380), but would reduce the market for Airbus’s existing wide-bodies by an even greater margin.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Irwin, Douglas A. & Pavcnik, Nina, 2004.

Endowments are the result of accumulation in response to economic in-centives. Taking this into account allows us to reconcile wildly di¤erent predictions in the empirical literature about the e¤ect of capital accumulation on manufacturing output. We estimate the e¤ect of factor proportions on specialization in a cross-section of OECD countries. We show that using the estimation results alone, we cannot dis-tinguish between specialization driven by factor proportions, and specialization that is correlated with factor proportions for other reasons. But our results are consistent with evidence on sectoral factor intensities, which supports the H-O theory.

Delayed overshooting may or may not occur depending upon the persistence of interest rate innovations and the degree of misperception.

If the oligopolistic industry is located in the domestic country only, we show that market concentration occurs if national and multinational firms coexist. In this case, FDI is welfare improving for the foreign country, but welfare declining for the domestic country. If only multinational firms are competitive, the impact on market structure and the welfare of the domestic country is indeterminate, whereas the welfare of the foreign country improves.

When ROW also behaves optimally, its policy response to the formation of the FTA is to raise tariffs.

Pass-through is endogenous because firms choose the currency in which they set their export prices. There is a unique equilibrium rate of pass-through under the condition that exchange rate volatility rises as the degree of pass-through falls. We show that the relationship between exchange rate volatility and economic structure may be substantially affected by the presence of endogenous pass-through. Our key results show that pass-through is related to the relative stability of monetary policy.

This framework delivers a simple welfare criterion based on the utility of the consumers that has the usual trade-off between stabilizing inflation and output. If the two regions share the same degree of nominal rigidity, the terms of trade are completely insulated from monetary policy and the optimal outcome is obtained by targeting a weighted average of the regional inflation rates. These weights coincide with the economic sizes of the region. If the degrees of rigidity are different, the optimal plan implies a high degree of inertia in the inflation rate. But an inflation targeting policy in which higher weight is given to the inflation in the region with higher degrees of nominal rigidity is nearly optimal.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Benigno, Pierpaolo, 2004.

Savings rates will respond asymmetrically to favorable movements in the permanent component of the terms of trade - in contrast with the predictions of conventional consumption-smoothing models.

In particular, we explore the role of information costs in determining the country distribution of U.S. investors' equity holdings using a comprehensive new data set on U.S. ownership of foreign stocks. We find that U.S. holdings of a country's equities are positively related to the share of that country's stock market that is listed on U.S. exchanges, even after controlling for capital controls, trade links, transaction costs, and historical risk-adjusted returns. We attribute this finding to the fact that foreign firms that list on U.S. exchanges are obliged to provide standardized, credible financial information, thereby reducing information costs incurred by U.S. investors. This obligation stems from U.S. investor protection regulations, which include stringent disclosure requirements, reconciliation of financial statements to U.S. standards, and an investor-friendly regulatory environment. Our results support the hypothesis that information costs are an important source of home bias: Foreign countries whose firms do not alleviate information costs by listing on a U.S. exchange are more severely underweighted in U.S. equity portfolios.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Ahearne, Alan G. & Griever, William L. & Warnock, Francis E., 2004.

Journal of International Economics,The merits of horizontal versus vertical FDI in the presence of uncertainty,"['Aizenman, Joshua', 'Marion, Nancy']","This paper examines the impact of uncertainty on the profitability of vertical and horizontal foreign direct investment (FDI). Vertical FDI takes place when the multinational fragments the production process internationally, locating each stage of production in the country where it can be done at the least cost. Horizontal FDI occurs when the multinational undertakes the same production activities in multiple countries. We consider a model where the risk-neutral multinational must commit its investment prior to the realization of shocks. The multinational has monopoly power and confronts two types of risk. It may face random productivity shocks or encounter a host country that tries to confiscate its rents. We show that greater uncertainty reduces the expected income from vertical FDI but increases the expected income from horizontal FDI. In addition, predatory actions by the host country are more costly to the multinational that has structured its production vertically rather than horizontally. Consequently, increased uncertainty should encourage horizontal FDI but discourage vertical FDI. If vertical FDI is more likely to flow into emerging markets and horizontal FDI into mature markets, then the empirical finding that most FDI is horizontal rather than vertical might be due, in part, to the greater uncertainty associated with emerging markets. We report cross-country regression results that provide some support for the predictions of the model. Volatility appears to have a differential impact on FDI inflows into mature and emerging markets. For mature markets that supposedly attract mainly horizontal FDI, greater volatility significantly increases FDI inflows. For emerging markets that receive relatively more vertical FDI inflows, increased volatility does not increase FDI inflows.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Aizenman, Joshua & Marion, Nancy, 2004.

This evidence, forcefully documented by Mussa (1986), is a puzzle to the extent that it is hard to reconcile with the assumption of flexible prices. This paper shows that a model that combines nominal rigidities with a systematic behavior of monetary policy approximating a managed-fixed exchange rate regime is consistent with Mussa's findings: the real exchange rate is between three and six times more variable under floating than under fixed rates, and this holds independently of the underlying shocks. The impact of the change in regime on the volatility of other real macroeconomic variables, however, depends crucially on the specification of the monetary policy rule and on the source of fluctuations. The model takes also a theoretical stand on other issues raised in the empirical literature, like the so-called exchange rate anomaly, and the international monetary policy shock transmission sign.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Monacelli, Tommaso, 2004.

Journal of International Economics,The composition of international capital flows: risk sharing through foreign direct investment,"['Albuquerque, Rui']","Evidence on international capital flows suggests that foreign direct investment (FDI) is less volatile than other financial flows. To explain this finding, I model international capital flows under the assumptions of imperfect enforcement of financial contracts and inalienability of FDI. Imperfect enforcement of contracts leads to endogenous financing constraints and the pricing of default risk. Inalienability implies that it is not as advantageous to expropriate FDI relative to other flows. These features combine to give a risk sharing advantage to FDI over other capital flows. This risk sharing advantage of FDI translates into a lower default premium and lower sensitivity to changes in a country's financing constraint. The model offers the new implication that financially constrained countries should borrow relatively more through FDI. This is because FDI is harder to expropriate and not because FDI is more productive or less volatile. Using several creditworthiness and country risk ratings to measure financing constraints, I present new evidence linking FDI and financing constraints. Moreover, numerical simulations of the model generate stronger serial correlation for FDI than for other flows into developing countries. This corroborates the view that non-FDI flows are more short-term and more likely to change direction.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Albuquerque, Rui, 2003.

Journal of International Economics,"Patience, persistence, and welfare costs of incomplete markets in open economies","['Kim, Jinill', 'Kim, Sunghyun Henry', 'Levin, Andrew']","In this paper, we investigate the welfare implications of alternative financial market structures in a two-country endowment economy model. In particular, we obtain an analytic expression for the expected lifetime utility of the representative household when sovereign bonds are the only internationally traded asset, and we compare this welfare level with that obtained under complete asset markets. The welfare cost of incomplete markets is negligible if agents are very patient and shocks are not very persistent, but this cost is dramatically larger if agents are relatively impatient and shocks are highly persistent. For realistic cases in which agents are very patient and shocks are highly persistent (that is, the discount factor and the first-order autocorrelation are both near unity), the welfare cost of incomplete markets is highly sensitive to the specific values of these parameters. Finally, using a non-linear solution algorithm, we confirm that a two-country production economy with endogenous labor supply has qualitatively similar welfare properties.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Kim, Jinill & Kim, Sunghyun Henry & Levin, Andrew, 2003.

Journal of International Economics,Reverse importing and asymmetric trade and FDI: a networks explanation,"['Greaney, Theresa M.']","This paper considers the impact of business and social networks on international trade and foreign direct investment (FDI). I propose that differences in the strength of network effects across countries can produce asymmetric trade and investment flows that may lead to trade friction. This proposition is examined using a model of multi-product producers of a differentiated product. A firm from a country with strong network effects has a cost advantage in selling to buyers from its own country. This advantage results in lower inward FDI, lower total imports but larger volumes of reverse imports (i.e., imports from overseas affiliates of that country’s own firms) into the country with strong network effects. The model’s predictions match observed asymmetric trade and investment flows that sometimes lead to US-Japan trade friction in industries such as automobiles.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Greaney, Theresa M., 2003.

We show that real exchange rate fluctuations affect the two criteria for dumping in opposite ways, making the overall effect on filings ambiguous in theory.

But once a banking crisis occurs, its real costs - in terms of forgone output growth - are higher for countries with more stringent exchange rate requirements.

The main finding of the Paper is that all models deliver virtually identical dynamics at business-cycle frequencies, as measured by unconditional second moments and impulse response functions.

Journal of International Economics,Spurious welfare reversals in international business cycle models,"['Kim, Jinill', 'Kim, Sunghyun Henry']","Several papers on international business cycles have documented spurious welfare reversals, in that incomplete market economies can produce higher welfare than the complete market economy. This paper demonstrates how conventional linearization, as used in King, Plosser, and Rebelo (1988), can generate approximation errors that are large enough to result in such reversals. Using a two-country production economy without capital, we argue that spurious welfare reversals are not only possible but also plausible under reasonable parameter values. As a constructive alternative, this paper proposes an approximation method that modifies the conventional linearization method by a bias correction---the linear approximation around a 'stochastic' steady state. We show that this method can be easily implemented to accurately approximate the exact solution and therefore produce the correct welfare ordering. The accuracy of the proposed method is far better than that of the conventional linearization method and as good as that of a method involving a second-order expansion.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Kim, Jinill & Kim, Sunghyun Henry, 2003.

We calculate out-of-sample forecasts as they would have been made at the time, and compare them to a random walk alternative. The resulting \""time series\"" of forecast performance indicates that both data revisions and changes in the sample period typically have large effects on exchange rate predictability. We show that the favorable evidence of long-horizon exchange rate predictability for the DM and Yen in Mark (1995) is present in only a narrow two-year window of data vintages around that used by Mark. In addition, approximately one-third of the improved forecasting performance of Mark's monetary model over a random walk is eventually undone by data revisions. Related to this, we find the models consistently perform better using original release data than using fully revised data. Finally, we find that model-based exchange rate forecasts are sometimes better when using Federal Reserve Staff forecasts of future fundamentals instead of actual future values of fundamentals. This contradicts a cherished presumption in the literature that dates all the way back to Meese and Rogoff (1983).(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Faust, Jon & Rogers, John H. & H.

Journal of International Economics,Understanding bilateral exchange rate volatility,"['Devereux, Michael B.', 'Lane, Philip R.']","This paper develops an empirical model of bilateral exchange rate volatility. We conjecture that for developing economies, external financial liabilities have an important effect on desired bilateral exchange rate volatility, above and beyond the standard Optimal Currency Area (OCA) factors. By contrast, industrial countries do not face the same set of constraints in international financial markets. In our theoretical model, external debt tightens financial constraints and reduces the efficiency of the exchange rate in responding to external shocks. We go on to explore the determinants of bilateral exchange rate volatility in a broad cross section of countries. For developing economies, bilateral exchnage rate volatility (relative to creditor countries) is strongly negatively affected by the stock of external debt. For industrial countries however, OCA variables appear more important and external debt is generally not significant in explaining bilateral exchange rate volatility.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Devereux, Michael B. & Lane, Philip R., 2003.

Journal of International Economics,"Market presence, contestability, and the terms-of-trade effects of regional integration","['Schiff, Maurice', 'Chang, Won']","How firms react to a given shock may depend on the degree to which rivals are present and on whether potentially viable entrants to that market exist. The authors try to measure these effects internationally by examining the price behavior of the United States in Brazil's market when MERCOSUR trade liberalization and most-favored-nation (MFN) trade liberalization take place. Using detailed panel data on trade and tariff rates, they find that both the market presence of a preferred supplier and expected entry lessen the U.S. price reaction to MFN trade liberalization and increase the U.S. price reaction to preferential trade liberalization. Argentina's presence in Brazil's market results in a smaller U.S. price response to Brazil's MFN tariff change and in a larger response to a preferential tariff change. More surprisingly, the quantitative effects of market presence and expected entry (contestability) are not significantly different from each other. Contestability plays no significant role when Argentina's is absent from Brazil's market, contestability lessens the U.S. response to changes in the MFN tariff and increases it in response to changes in the preferential tariff. It follows from these results that presence in, as well as threat of entry into, partners'markets implies lower optimal external tariffs and suggests that regional agreements can have pro-competitive effects in the presence of contestability.

Journal of International Economics,Endogenous market structure and the growth and welfare effects of economic integration,"['Peretto, Pietro F.']","I study the growth and welfare effects of integration in a world economy populated by global oligopolists. For economies that move from autarky to trade, I show that growth and welfare rise because exit of domestic firms is more than compensated by entry of foreign firms so that integration generates a larger, more competitive market where firms have access to a larger body of technological spillovers that support faster growth. The effects of a gradual reduction of barriers to trade - a global reduction in tariffs - are different because economies start out from a situation where all firms already serve all markets. In this case, integration brings about a reduction of the global number of firms so that the variety of consumption goods and the diversity of innovation paths fall. The surviving firms, on the other hand, are larger and exploit static and dynamic economies of scale to a larger degree. These homogeneization and rationalization effects work in opposite directions. Under plausible conditions, the rationalization effect dominates and growth and welfare rise.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Peretto, Pietro F., 2003.

The responsiveness of these gross job flows to the real exchange rate reflects pervasive heterogeneity with respect to international conditions across firms, even within narrowly defined industries. We document this heterogeneity and show that the responsiveness of job flows to movements in the real exchange rate varies with the industry's openness to international trade.

It employs a novel identification approach which uses the sign of the cross correlation function in response to shocks to catalog orthogonal disturbances. We find that demand shocks are the dominant source output, inflation and term structure fluctuations in six of the G-7 countries. Within the class of demand disturbances, nominal shocks are dominant, but their importance declined after 1982.

Journal of International Economics,The protectionist bias of duty drawbacks: evidence from Mercosur,"['Cadot, Olivier', 'de Melo, Jaime', 'Olarreaga, Marcelo']","In a political-economy setting where tariffs and duty drawbacks are endogenously chosen through industry lobbying, it is shown that full duty-drawbacks are granted to exporters who use imported intermediates in their production. This in turn decreases their incentives to counter-lobby against high tariffs on their inputs. In equilibrium, higher tariffs will be observed on these goods. The creation of a regional block will change the political equilibrium. Duty-drawbacks will be eliminated on intra-regional exports, which in tum will lead to lower tariffs for goods used as inputs by intra-regional exporters. Evidence from Mercosur suggests that the elimination of duty-drawbacks for intra-regional exports led to increased counter-lobbying by users of intermediate products.

Journal of International Economics,Disinflation and fiscal reform: a neoclassical perspective,"['Rigobon, Roberto']","During the last two decades, many Latin American countries engaged in disinflation programs based on both exchange rate management and fiscal reforms. However, in most instances, part of the fiscal reform was delayed or not implemented completely, so the fiscal deficit increased and the program had to be abandoned. The aftermath of these programs is not encouraging, since most of these policies turned out to be failures, lowering reserves and causing higher inflation rates. Given this record, it is worth asking why governments start a disinflation program even though the fiscal equilibrium is not guaranteed. In this paper we show that, if the reform process is uncertain and inflation has welfare costs, the optimal exchange rate policy implies the initiation of a disinflation program at the announcement of the fiscal reform. Additionally, we show that even if there exists a possibility of a balance of payments crisis, it is still optimal to initiate a disinflation program. This means that, in this set up, avoiding the crisis with probability one is suboptimal. Finally, we show that it is optimal to engage in a sequence of stabilization programs until one of them is successful.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Rigobon, Roberto, 2002.

A country’s pattern of specialization is viewed as a distribution across sectors, and statistical techniques for analyzing the evolution of this entire distribution are employed. The empirical framework is implemented using data on 20 industries in 7 OECD countries since 1970. We find substantial mobility in patterns of specialization. Over time horizons of 5 years, this is largely explained by forces common across countries including world prices and common changes in technical efficiency. Over longer time horizons, country-specific changes in factor endowments become more important. There is no evidence of an increase in countries’ overall degree of specialization.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Redding, Stephen, 2002.

A model drawing on Grossman and Helpman (1994, 1996) is used to derive an empirically estimable government objective function. The key structural parameters of this model are estimated using province-level data on foreign direct investment and trade flows in China, over the years 1984-1995. We find that the weight applied to consumer welfare is between one-fifth and one-twelfth of the weight applied to the output of state-owned enterprises. We find that governmental preferences have shifted over time, but even in recent periods the weight on consumer welfare is only one-half of the weight on state-owned enterprises.

Journal of International Economics,Does trade raise income?: Evidence from the twentieth century,"['Irwin, Douglas A.', 'Tervio, Marko']","Efforts to estimate the effects of international trade on a country's real income have been hampered by the failure to account for the endogeneity of trade. Frankel and Romer recently use a country's geographic attributes - notably its distance from potential trading partners - as an instrument to identify the effects of trade on income in 1985. Using data from the pre- World War I, the interwar, and the post-war periods, this paper finds that the Frankel-Romer result is robust to different time periods, i.e., that instrumenting for trade with geographic characteristics raises the estimated positive effect of trade on income by a substantial margin and, in most of our cases, the precision of those estimates. These results suggest that the downward bias of OLS estimates is systematic and may be due to measurement error, a potential source of which is that trade is an imperfect proxy for a host of economically beneficial interactions between countries. However, the results are not robust to the inclusion of another geographic variable, latitude (distance from the equator).(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Irwin, Douglas A. & Tervio, Marko, 2002.

Journal of International Economics,Anonymous market and group ties in international trade,"['Casella, Alessandra', 'Rauch, James E.']","When trade involves differentiated products, preferential ties to a group settled abroad facilitate an exporter’s entry into the foreign market by providing information and access to distribution channels. This contrasts with the difficulties experienced by an unattached producer unfamiliar with the foreign environment. Inspired by the role of coethnic ties and business groups in East Asia, we build a simple general equilibrium model of trade that formalizes this simple idea. Output is generated through bilateral matching of agents spanning a spectrum of types. Domestic matching is perfect – every trader knows the type of all others and can approach any, but international matching is random – every trader lacks the information to choose a partner’s type. Group ties, however, allow perfect matching abroad to a minority of individuals who have access to them and can decide whether or not to exploit them. We show that in the absence of ties the existence of informational barriers reduces the volume of trade. By increasing trade, group ties are beneficial to the economy as a whole, but have significant distributional effects. On average, group members benefit, but some may lose; non-members lose almost without exception, while the largest losses are concentrated among those with the poorest domestic market niches.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Casella, Alessandra & Rauch, James E., 2002.

The analysis applies data on the delayed producer payment structure of the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) and examines its merits as a rent-shifting mechanism in the international durum market. The model fails to reject the hypothesis that the CWB utilizes a pre-commitment mechanism in the international durum market and several nonparametric tests confirm that the observed transfer payments set by the CWB are consistent with rent-shifting behavior in the 1972-95 pre-WTO period.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Hamilton, Stephen F. & Stiegert, Kyle W., 2002.

Journal of International Economics,A U-shaped Europe?: A simulation study of industrial location,"['Forslid, Rikard', 'Haaland, Jan I.', 'Midelfart Knarvik, Karen Helene']","This paper uses a full-scale CGE-model - calibrated on 1992 data - to investigate the effects of European integration on the location of industrial production. Our results reveal large differences among individual industries. Industries with high scale elasticities typically display a non-monotonous relationship between trade liberalisation and concentration, with maximal concentration for intermediate trade costs. Other industries, more driven by comparative advantage, become more and more concentrated as trade costs are lowered. On the aggregate European level we find an (inverse) U-shaped relation between trade costs and concentration, with Europe 1992 close to the peak of concentration. The results also show a close correlation between real income gains and growth in manufacturing production; we label this an ""externality shifting"" effect - gains from pecuniary externalities in the manufacturing sectors. Finally, we note that nominal factor prices co-vary as regions specialise, while in relative terms there are traces of the Stolper-Samelson theorem.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Forslid, Rikard & Haaland, Jan I. & Midelfart Knarvik, Karen Helene, 2002.

Journal of International Economics,Real effects of collapsing exchange rate regimes: an application to Mexico,"['Osakwe, Patrick N.', 'Schembri, Lawrence L.']","This paper examines the impact of a collapsing exchange rate regime on output in an open economy in which shocks to capital flows and exports predominate. A sticky-price rational expec-tations model is used to compare the variability of output under the collapsing regime to that under alternative fixed and flexible regimes. Output is found to be most stable under a flexible rate. A counterfactual exercise is performed for Mexico, using the parallel market exchange rate as a proxy for the shadow flexible rate. The main finding is that had Mexico been on a flexible rate for the past two decades, instead of a series of collapsing regimes, the variance of real output would have been reduced by half.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Osakwe, Patrick N. & Schembri, Lawrence L., 2002.

In addition, motivated by the fact that these types of controls have often been left in place after the dissipation of the shock that lead to the controls being implemented, the paper evaluates the welfare cost of procrastination in removing these types of controls.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Reinhart, Carmen M. & Smith, R.

Journal of International Economics,Tariff-jumping antidumping duties,"['Blonigen, Bruce A.']","Using a newly constructed database, this paper examines the tariff-jumping response of all firm and product combinations subject to U.S. AD investigations from 1980-1990. The results strongly support the hypothesis that tariff-jumping is only a realistic option for multinational firms from industrialized countries. Because many firms subject to U.S. AD investigations and eventual duties do not have these characteristics, tariff-jumping of U.S. AD protection is relatively modest. It may also explain why developing countries have been more concerned about addressing AD protection in the WTO than industrialized countries. While the raw numbers show a high tariff-response rate for Japanese firms, this is due almost solely to the fact that many of these firms have substantial multinational experience, not due to any Japanese-specific response per se. I also find little evidence that certain U.S. Department of Commerce procedures that use information from the domestic petitioners (rather than the foreign firms) to calculate dumping margins has any impact on tariff-jumping responses.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Blonigen, Bruce A., 2002.

Journal of International Economics,Coalition formation in international monetary policy games,"['Kohler, Marion']","It is well known from the analysis of monetary policy co-ordination of two countries that co-ordination often Pareto-dominates the outcome of the non-co-operative game. Hence both countries will have an incentive to form a union when it is certain that the other country will also join. However, in an n-country model, free-riding incentives restrict the size of a stable coalition to less then n countries.

Journal of International Economics,Time consistent export quotas in an oligopolistic world market,"['Gervais, Jean-Philippe', 'Lapan, Harvey E.']","We investigate the strategic behavior between exporting countries that face endogenous terms of trade on the world market. In a non-cooperative setting, if production decisions occur before consumption decisions, the ex-ante optimal export quota is not time consistent as the ex-post elasticity of the residual foreign import demand curve is lower than the ex-ante elasticity. However, we show that the exporters? inability to irrevocably commit to their quota may be welfare superior to the precommitment solution. If exporters can sell forward a proportion of their exports before production decisions are made, they will do so even though, in equilibrium, it may decrease welfare compared to a situation in which forward markets do not exist. Moreover, the equilibrium with forward markets is welfare inferior to the commitment equilibrium for exporters.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Gervais, Jean-Philippe & Lapan, Harvey E., 2002.

Moreover, we find evidence of substantial production indeterminacy. Prediction errors are six to thirty times larger for goods traded relatively freely. A compelling explanation of this phenomenon is the existence of more goods than factors in the presence of trade costs. This result implies that regressions of trade or output on endowments have weak theoretical foundations. Furthermore, since errors are largest in data sets where trade costs are small, we explain why the common methodology of imputing trade barriers from regression residuals often leads to backwards results.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Bernstein, Jeffrey R. & Weinstein, David E., 2002.

Under Bertrand competition, the low-quality country subsidizes investment to raise export quality, while the high-quality country imposes a tax so as to reduce the quality of its already high quality exports.

Journal of International Economics,Option pricing and foreign investment under political risk,"['Cherian, Joseph A.', 'Perotti, Enrico']","The paper analyzes foreign investment and asset prices in a context of uncertainty over future government policy. The model endogenizes the process of learning by foreign investors facing a potentially opportunistic government, which chooses strategically the timing of a policy reversal in order to attract more capital. We characterize the evolution of confidence, investment, and asset prices over time, as well as perceived policy risk. Quite generally, perceived risk abates as current policy is maintained, leading to a gradual appreciation of asset prices and a gradual decrease in their conditional variance. The approach thus provides a measure of the evolution over time of perceived political risk from market prices. We next compute option prices under the process generated by the model's hazard rate of policy reversal plus an additional market risk component. We show that both the time series and the term structure of conditional volatility in general is downward sloping and its overall level falls steadily over time, although it may exhibit initially a hump shape in the case of very low initial reputation. Another testable implication is that in price series without a policy reversal, implied volatility from option prices will exceed actual volatility. Over time, and in the absence of a reversal, this wedge progressively disappears. This may be viewed as the volatility analogue of the 'peso premium' for assets subject to large, infrequent price drops.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Cherian, Joseph A. & Perotti, Enrico, 2001.

The second is a sticky-consumer-price cum volatile exchange-rate effect. Both are shown to be important empirically, the second type especially so. We argue that the two effects are very different from each other. For the first type of effect, it is clear that border effects imply deadweight welfare losses. We argue that while the second type of border effect could be eliminated with fixed exchange rates, welfare is not necessarily increased.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract w(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Engel, Charles & Rogers, John H., 2001.

Journal of International Economics,Borders and business cycles,"['Clark, Todd E.', 'van Wincoop, Eric']","We document that business cycles of U.S. Census regions are substantially more synchronized than those of European Union countries, both over the past four decades and the past two decades. Data from regions within the four largest European countries confirm the presence of a European border effect --within-country correlations are substantially larger than cross-country correlations. These results continue to hold after controlling for exogenous factors such as distance and size. We consider the role of four factors that have received a lot of attention in the debate about EMU: sectoral specialization, the level of trade, monetary policy and fiscal policy. We find that the lower level of trade between European countries, and to a lesser extent the higher degree of sectoral specialization, can explain most of the observed border effect.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Clark, Todd E. & van Wincoop, Eric, 2001.

We show that a simple average of good-level real exchange rates tracks the nominal exchange rate well, suggesting strong evidence of sticky prices. Focusing on dispersion in prices between city-pairs, we find that crossing the U.S.-Japan Border' is equivalent to adding as much as 43,000 trillion miles to the cross-country volatility of relative prices. We turn next to economic explanations for this so-called border effect and to its dynamics. Distance, unit-shipping costs, and exchange rate variability, collectively, explain a substantial portion of the observed international market segmentation. Relative wage variability, on the other hand, has little independent impact on segmentation.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Parsley, David C. & Wei, Shang-Jin, 2001.

In particular, intraindustry FDI between rich nations is almost as pervasive as intraindustry trade among rich nations. In the standard' MNC model (of Markusen, Venables, Brainard, and others), FDI is driven by a tradeoff between proximity and scale, so firms typically supply the foreign market via exports or via FDI.

Journal of International Economics,The nature and growth of vertical specialization in world trade,"['Hummels, David', 'Ishii, Jun', 'Yi, Kei-Mu']","Dramatic changes are occurring in the nature of international trade. Production processes increasingly involve a sequential, vertical trading chain stretching across many countries, with each country specializing in particular stages of a good's production sequence. We document a key aspect of these vertical linkages--the use of imported inputs in producing goods that are exported -- which we call vertical specialization. Using input-output tables from the OECD and emerging market countries we estimate that vertical specialization accounts for up to 30 percent of world exports, and has grown as much as 40 percent in the last twenty-five years. The key insight about why vertical specialization has grown so much lies with the fact that trade barriers (tariffs and transportation costs) are incurred repeatedly as goods-in-process cross multiple borders. Hence, even small reductions in tariffs and transport costs can lead to extensive vertical specialization, large trade growth, and large gains from trade. We formally illustrate these points by developing an extension of the Dornbusch-Fischer-Samuelson ricardian trade model.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Hummels, David & Ishii, Jun & Yi, Kei-Mu, 2001.

Our global economy resembles Rosen (1981) Superstars economy, where a) innovations in production and communication technologies enable suppliers to reach a larger mass of consumers and to improve the (perceived) quality of their products and b) trade barriers fall. When transport cost fall, income is redistributed away from the non-exporting to the exporting sector of the economy. As the latter turns out to employ workers of higher skill and pay, the effect is to raise wage inequality. Whether the least skilled are stand to lose or gain from improved production or communication technologies, in contrast, depends on whether technology is skill-complement or substitute. The model provides an intuitive explanation for why changes in wage premia are so strongly affected by export growth in plant-level empirical investigations (Bernard and Jensen (1997)).(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Manasse, Paolo & Turrini, Alessandro, 2001.

Journal of International Economics,Rational incompatibility with international product standards,"['Barrett, Christopher B.', 'Yang, Yi-Nung']"," This paper considers the incentives of firms to conform to an exogenous international product standard. Product standardization enables traditional, price-based international competition. But the existence of redesign costs or network effects creates market frictions that diminish the incentive to standardize if there already exists a different technology in an established market. This leads to multi-attribute competition between products and will generally reduce trade flows. Not only do incumbent firms using a different technology have an incentive to deviate from the international standard, but a host country government that is also concerned for the welfare of consumers who own the old technology has no incentive to enforce the international standard.

We seek to measure the maximum potential effect of capital controls, such as non-interest paying reserve requirements, on interest rate differentials.

An optimal (S,s) rule gives the limits for interest rate differentials that trigger massive capital inflows and outflows. We also calculate maximum sustainable interest rate differentials for various maturities and study the effect of parameter changes.

We show that the more important trade competition, the more likely self-fulfilling speculative crises and the larger the set of multiple equilibria. Coordination decreases the possibility of simultaneous self-fulfilling speculative crises in the region and reduces the set of multiple equilibria.

Journal of International Economics,Economic geography and the fiscal effects of regional integration,"['Ludema, Rodney D.', 'Wooton, Ian']","In models of economic geography, plant-level scale economies and trade costs create incentives for spatial agglomeration of production into a manufacturing core and agricultural periphery, creating regional income differentials. We examine tax competition between national governments to influence the location of manufacturing activity. Labour is imperfectly mobile and governments impose redistributive taxes. Regional integration is modeled as either increased labour mobility or lower trade costs. We show that either type of integration may result in a decrease in the intensity of tax competition, and thus higher equilibrium taxes. Moreover, economic integration must increase taxes when the forces of agglomeration are the strongest.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Ludema, Rodney D. & Wooton, Ian, 2000.

Journal of International Economics,Standards and protection,"['Fischer, Ronald', 'Serra, Pablo']","This paper examines the behavior of a country that imposes a minimum standard on a good produced both by a domestic firm and by a foreign competitor, and where the latter also supplies its own market. Production costs rise with the standard, and the foreign firm incurs a fixed setup cost if it produces at two standard levels. When the domestic government raises the minimum standard, the foreign producer has to choose between sacrificing exports, facing higher production cost on its entire output, or incurring the fixed setup cost. Depending on the size of the foreign market and the fixed setup cost, the domestic firm will lobby for the lowest minimum standard that excludes the foreign firm or for no standard at all. When consumption of the good produces an externality, the domestic social planner sets a minimum standard which is a non-increasing function of the size of the foreign market. When an externality is present, we show that the planner is always protectionist in the sense that it chooses a higher standard than the one it would set if both firms were domestic.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Fischer, Ronald & Serra, Pablo, 2000.

Journal of International Economics,"Location costs, product quality and implicit franchise contracts","['Haucap, Justus', 'Wey, Christian', 'Barmbold, Jens']","In the literature on international trade, very little attention has been given to informational asymmetries between firms and consumers with respect to product quality. The few economic models that analyze the question of how asymmetric information about product quality might affect trade flows treat product quality as exogenous. In contrast, our model takes product quality as an endogenous variable, i.e. firms can choose the quality they wish to produce. In this case, location costs can signal product quality under certain conditions and thereby affect international trade flows. More specifically, intra-industry trade in vertical differentiated experience goods can be determined by information asymmetries about product quality. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG - (Standortkosten, Produktqualität und implizite Franchiseverträge) In der internationalen Handelstheorie ist der Tatsache, daß die Konsumenten in vielen Fällen nur unvollständige Information über die Produktqualität besitzen, kaum Rechnung getragen worden. Die wenigen Arbeiten, die die Wirkungen asymmetrischer Information zwischen Herstellern und Konsumenten auf den internationalen Handel untersuchen, behandeln die Produktqualität als exogene Variable. Im Gegensatz hierzu wird in diesem Beitrag Produktqualität als eine endogene Variable angesehen, die von den Unternehmen gewählt werden kann. Es wird argumentiert, daß in diesem Fall die Standortkosten zur Signalisierung der Produktqualität eines Unternehmens herangezogen werden können. Es zeigt sich, daß unter bestimmten Bedingungen die geeignete Wahl von standortspezifischen variable Kosten in Verbindung mit Standortaustrittskosten zu einem Trenngleichgewicht führen kann, in dem an einem relativ teuren Standort Hochqualitätsprodukte und an einem relativ billigen Standort Niedrigqualitätsprodukte hergestellt werden.

Journal of International Economics,Foreign aid and rent-seeking,"['Svensson, Jakob']","To address the relationship between concessional assistance, corruption, and other types of rent-seeking activities, the author provides a simple game-theoretic rent-seeking model. Insights with interesting implications emerge from the analysis: 1) An increase in government revenue (from windfalls, for example, or from increased foreign aid) does not necessarily lead to the provision of more public goods and in certain circumstances may reduce it. 2) The mere expectation of aid may suffice to increase rent-dissipation and reduce productive public spending. But if the donor community can enter into a binding policy commitment, this result may be reversed. The author provides some preliminary empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis that windfalls and foreign aid, in countries suffering from a divided policy process, are on average associated with more extensive corruption. He finds no evidence that donors systematically allocate aid to countries with less corruption. The results accords with recent empirical findings that aid is more effective, the greater the effort to direct it to good performers.

Journal of International Economics,Rational contagion and the globalization of securities markets,"['Calvo, Guillermo A.', 'Mendoza, Enrique G.']","This paper argues that the globalization of securities markets may promote contagion among investors by weakening incentives for gathering costly country-specific information and by strengthening incentives for imitating arbitrary market portfolios. In the presence of short-selling constraints, the utility gain of gathering information at a fixed cost converges to a constant level and may diminish as securities markets grow. Moreover, if a portfolio manager's marginal cost for yielding below-market returns exceeds the marginal gain for above-market returns, there is a range of optimal portfolios in which all investors imitate arbitrary market portfolios and this range widens as the market grows. Numerical simulations suggest that these frictions can have significant quantitative implications and they may induce large capital flows in emerging markets.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Calvo, Guillermo A. & Mendoza, Enrique G., 2000.

The often found negative correlation between the expected currency depreciation and interest rate differential is, contrary to popular belief, not a pervasive phenomenon. It is confined to developed economies, and here only to states where the U.S. interest rate exceeds foreign interest rates. Furthermore, we find that differences across economies are systematically related to per capita GNP, average inflation rates, and inflation volatility. Our empirical work suggests that it is hard to justify the cross-sectional differences in the risk premia as compensation for systematic risk. Instead, country-specific attributes seem to be important in characterizing the cross-sectional dispersion in the risk premia.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Bansal, Ravi & Dahlquist, Magnus, 2000.

Journal of International Economics,Trade liberalisation and endogenous growth: A q-theory approach,"['Baldwin, Richard E.', 'Forslid, Rikard']","This paper has two purposes. It introduces a direct approach to policy analysis in endogenous growth models - the q-theory approach - and uses this to illustrate several new openness-and-growth links that appear when we enrich the economic content of the early trade and growth models. The approach - inspired by Tobin's q - is merely a change of state variables and re-interpretation of steady-state conditions. The main difference is its focus on investment, which is after all, the heart of growth models. The approach's simplicity permits us to complicate the early models in interesting directions and to explicitly include trade barriers. The latter allows study of incremental policy reform rather than mere shifts from autarky to free trade (or small deviations from free trade) as in early literature.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Baldwin, Richard E. & Forslid, Rikard, 2000.

For realistic parameters, soft target zones are significantly less vulnerable to speculative attacks than ""hard"" target zones.

Journal of International Economics,Budget deficit persistence and the twin deficits hypothesis,"['Normandin, Michel']","This paper gauges the causal relationship between external and budget deficits by using Blanchard's overlapping generations model. This model sests the twin deficits hypothesis (i.e. there is a positive relationship between the deficits) and the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis (i.e. there is no link between the deficits). This model also implies that consumers forecast future budget deficits using (at least) the history of the two deficits. This implication is used to derive time series restrictions, which are testable for given comsumer's planning horizons. For the relevant horizon, the response of the external deficit to an increase in the budget deficit is computed. For the Canadian and the U.S. economies, the relevant horizons can be as long as 83 years. However, given the persistence of the budget deficits, these horizons produce responses that are statistically significant. These findings reconcile the mixed results obtained in previous analyses. Cette étude évalue la relation de causalité entre les déficits extérieur et budgétaire à partir du modèle de générations imbriquées proposé par Blanchard (1985). Ce modèle emboîte l'hypothèse des déficits jumeaux (i.e. il y a une relation positive entre les déficits) et l'hypothèse d'équivalence ricardienne (i.e. il n'y a aucun lien entre les déficits). Aussi, ce modèle implique que les consommateurs prévoient les déficits budgétaires futurs en considérant l'évolution des deux déficits. Cette implication permet de dériver des restrictions pouvant être testées pour certains horizons de planification des consommateurs. Pour les horizons pertinents, la réponse du déficit extérieur à une augmentation du déficit budgétaire est calculée. Pour les économies canadienne et américaine, les horizons pertinents peuvent être aussi longs que 83 ans. Compte tenu de la persistance des déficits budgétaires, ces horizons procurent toutefois des réponses qui sont statistiquement significatives.

Journal of International Economics,The three faces of factor intensities,"['Jones, Ronald W.', 'Beladi, Hamid', 'Marjit, Sugata']","The concept of factor intensity has played a key role in the development of international trade theory. The factor proportions utilized in the production of commodities differ from activity to activity. Some commodities employ a higher ratio of capital to labor than do others, and the basic Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem explaining the pattern of international trade links a nations's factor endowment proportions of capital to labor to the capital/labor factor intensities of its export activities. This theorem has been exhaustively analyzed to reveal that exceptions may occur when technologies exhibit factor-intensity reversals, when demand conditions are highly asymmetric between countries, or when the number of factors and commodities exceeds the frequently-assumed value two. Our remarks in this paper proceed along different lines. We argue that in explaining the link between factor intensities associated with a nation's exports, imports or non-traded activities and that nation's factor endowment base, at least three rather separate roles for factor intensities can be identified. Once this is done, paradoxical statements such as, ""Exports from laborabundant countries are capital intensive"", can be shown to have some validity. Furthermore, in explaining this position recourse is had to various characteristics of technology and trade which have been in the forefront of recent developments in trade theory, e.g., quality differences in an intra-industry setting, increasing returns to scale activities, uncertainty in production, and the role of services in trade.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Jones, Ronald W. & Beladi, Hamid & Marjit, Sugata, 1999.

Journal of International Economics,Supplier relations and the market context: A theory of handshakes,"['McLaren, John']"," This paper provides an economic theory of the degree of formality in industrial procurement. The argument is based on a tension between two procurement goals: imposing cost discipline on the supplier, and creating the conditions for cooperative innovation. In this model, a contract can solve the cost discipline problem, but only by discouraging cooperation; a less formal arrangement provides cooperation but poor discipline. The attractiveness of contracts is smaller, the less vertically integrated the industry, because a thick market for inputs provides its own discipline incentives even without a contract. Thus, in highly integrated industries, contracts are used, while in less integrated industries business is done on handshakes. This theory of the role of market context roughly fits some stylized facts and international comparisons, and may be a useful complement to some sociological approaches.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","McLaren, John, 1999.

First, for a class of technologies including Cobb-Douglas, the model implies that the relative price of nontraded goods in each country should reflect the relative productivity of labor in the traded and nontraded goods sectors. Second, the model assumes that purchasing power parity holds for traded goods in the long-run. We test each of these implications using data from a panel of OECD countries. Our results suggest that the first of these two fits the data quite well. In the long run, relative prices generally reflect relative labor productivities. The evidence on purchasing power parity in traded goods is considerably less favorable. When we look at US dollar exchange rates, PPP does not appear to hold for traded goods, even in the long run. On the other hand, when we look at DM exchange rates purchasing power parity appears to be a somewhat better characterization of traded goods prices.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Canzoneri, Matthew B. & Cumby, Robert E. & Diba, Behzad, 1999.

In contrast, this paper finds large and persistent TFP differences across a group of industrialized countries in the 1980s.

Journal of International Economics,How big are potential welfare gains from international risksharing?,"['van Wincoop, Eric']","There is extensive evidence that the degree of risksharing accomplished by international financial markets is low. Some have argued that this is the result of small potential benefits from risksharing. The gains from riskpooling that have been reported in the literature range from negligible to enormous. This paper documents to what extent the results are sensitive to the parameterization of preferences, and assumptions about the stochastic process and measurement of the endowment. We find that for realistic assumptions about the underlying factors, the potential gains from risksharing are quite sizable. For OECD countries they are equivalent to increases in tradables consumption in the range of 1.1 to 3.5% for a 50 year horizon, and 2.5 to 7.4% for a 100 year horizon(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","van Wincoop, Eric, 1999.

We assume that the production of 'Smokestack' manufactures generates pollution, which lowers the productivity of an environmentally sensitive sector ('Farming'). As a result, the long run production set is non-convex. Pollution provides a motive for trade, since trade can spatially separate incompatible industries. Two identical, unregulated countries will gain from trade if the share of world income spent on Smokestack is high. In contrast, when the share of world income spent on the dirty good is low, trade can usher in a negatively reinforcing process of environmental degradation and real income loss for the exporter of Smokestack.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Copeland, Brian R. & Taylor, M.

Journal of International Economics,Multinational firms and the new trade theory,"['Markusen, James R.', 'Venables, Anthony J.']","A model is constructed in which multinational firms may arise endogenously. Multinationals exist in equilibrium when transport and tariff costs are high, incomes are high, and firm-level scale economies are important relative to plant-level scale economies. Less obvious, multinationals are more important in total economic activity when countries are more similar in incomes, relative factor endowments, and technologies. The model may thus be useful in explaining several stylized facts, including (a) the growing importance of direct investment relative to trade among the developed countries over time and (b) the greater ratio of investment to trade among the developed countries relative to this ratio for 'north-south' or 'south-south' economic relationships. The model offers predictions about the volume of trade that contrast with those of the 'new trade theory', predicting that trade at first rises and then falls as countries converge in incomes, relative endowments, and technologies. Welfare is also considered, and it is shown that direct investment makes the smaller (or high cost) country better off, but may make the larger (or low cost) country worse off.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Markusen, James R. & Venables, Anthony J., 1998.

We suggest another test where the null hypothesis is violated only when all of the processes are stationary. This test is easily constructed and has a known limiting distribution.

Exchange market pressures mainly reflect asymmetric shocks, while intervention largely reflects the variables that OCA theory suggests cause countries to value stable exchange rates (small size and the extent of trade links).

These disciplining effects of a monetary union, which rise with the number of fiscal players in the union, are likely to raise welfare. Joining an optimally designed monetary union is particularly attractive if fiscal authorities do not care about inflation.

Journal of International Economics,Target zones and exchange rates:: An empirical investigation,"['Bekaert, Geert', 'Gray, Stephen F.']","In this paper we develop an empirical model of exchange rates in a target zone. The model is general enough to nest most theoretical and empirical models in the existing literature. We find evidence of two types of jumps in exchange rates. Realignment jumps are those that are associated with the periodic realignments of the target zone and within-the-band jumps are those that can be accommodated within the current target zone. The exchange rate may jump outside the current target zone band, in the case of a realignment, but when no jump occurs the target zone is credible (there is zero probability of a realignment) and the exchange rate must stay within the band. We incorporate jumps, in general, by conditioning the distribution of exchange rate changes on a jump variable where the probability and size of a jump vary over time as a function of financial and macroeconomic variables. With this more general model, we revisit the empirical evidence from the European Monetary System regarding the conditional distribution of exchange rate changes, the credibility of the system, and the size of the foreign exchange risk premia. In contrast to some previous findings, we conclude that the FF/DM rate exhibits considerable non-linearities, realignments are predictable and the credibility of the system did not increase after 1987. Moreover, our model implies that the foreign exchange risk premium becomes large during speculative crises. A comparison with the Deutschemark/Dollar rate suggests that an explicit target zone does have a noticeable effect on the time-series behavior of exchange rates.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Bekaert, Geert & Gray, Stephen F., 1998.

Such ‘externalities’ are shown to have dramatic implications; shocks on each fundamental affect the whole range of exchange rates involved, intra-marginal interventions arise endogenously, and the exchange rate distribution does not exhibit the u-shaped pattern which is typical of traditional target zone models.

However, a diversified resource exporting country necessarily suffers a decline in steady state utility resulting from trade, and may lose along the entire transition path.

By contrast, an optimal portfolio may exhibit substantial home bias with respect to nontraded-good equities, although this result requires a very low degree of substitution between traded and nontraded goods in the utility function.

The benefit to our approach is that the analysis of business cycles within one country is a natural experiment for understanding the 'anomalies' found in international business cycles since, as in the model, there are no tariffs or trade barriers between states in the U.S. and there is only one currency. ; Similar to the evidence for international business cycles, but contrary to the theory, we find that consumption is less contemporaneously correlated across states than output. This observed deficiency of intratemporal (contemporaneous) risk sharing is referred to as the `quantity anomaly'. Unlike the international data, however, we find that the `price anomaly' does not hold for intranational data; namely, the terms of trade for states are not more volatile than output or productivity shocks. Furthermore, we present additional evidence based on the relationships between labor earnings, non-labor earnings and government transfers which supports the view that the observed amount of intratemporal risk sharing is quite limited as compared to the observed amount of intertemporal risk sharing.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Hess, Gregory D. & Shin, Kwanho, 1998.

Cette étude explore dans quelle mesure il existe des liens bilatéraux de R-D entre les États-Unis et le Japon, qui affectent les choix de production, les investissements en capital physique et en R-D, et les croissances de la productivité. Nous trouvons que la production devient moins intensive en travail avec l'accroissement des externalités de la R-D. Dans le court terme, il y a une complémentarité entre la recherche propre et les externalités de la recherche étrangère. Cette relation subsiste dans le long terme aux États-Unis. Au Japon, par contre, les externalités de la R-D américaine ont tendance à réduire la recherche propre. Le stock de R-D des États-Unis explique 60% de la croissance de la productivité totale ds facteurs japonaise tandis que celle des États-Unis est due pour 20% à la recherche nippone. Les externalités internationales de la R-D rendent le taux de rendement social de la R-D quatre fois plus grand que le taux de rendement privé.

Journal of International Economics,Has Latin America's post-reform growth been disappointing?,"['Easterly, William', 'Loayza, Norman', 'Montiel, Peter']","After years of poor economic performance, many Latin American countries undertook ambitious programs of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform in recent years. This change in policy created high expectations for the region, and some observers have questioned whether actual growth outcomes have lived up to these expectations. The authors offer evidence that the response of economic growth to reforms in Latin America has not been disappointing. Because of their significant policy changes, and despite a global slowdown, Latin America did well to return to its historic growth rate of 2 percent per capita in 1990-93. Latin America has responded to changes in policy variables, as would have been predicted by the experience of other times and places. Those earlier experiences are summarized by a panel regression spanning many countries and multi-year periods from 1960 to 1993. To get consistent estimates of the parameters linking growth and policy variables, the authors use a dynamic panel methodology that both controls for unobserved time- and country-specific effects and accounts for the likely internal dynamism of the explanatory variables.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Easterly, William & Loayza, Norman & Montiel, Peter, 1997.

A preferential move towards a customs union attracts industry to the integrating countries. When internal barriers fall below some critical level, input-output links between imperfectly competitive firms lead some customs union countries to gain industry at the expense of others. Closer integration can bring converging industrial development to the union. A hub-and-spoke arrangement favours location in the hub, with better reciprocal access to spoke nations than to each other. Further liberalization induces agglomeration in the hub and may trigger disparities between the spokes.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Puga, Diego & Venables, Anthony J., 1997.

Journal of International Economics,Foreign direct investment and relative wages: Evidence from Mexico's maquiladoras,"['Feenstra, Robert C.', 'Hanson, Gordon H.']","In this paper, we examine the increase in the relative wages of skilled workers in Mexico during the 1980s. We argue that rising wage inequality in Mexico is linked to capital inflows from abroad. The effect of these capital inflows, which correspond to an increase in outsourcing by multinationals from the United States and other Northern countries, is to shift production in Mexico towards relatively skill-intensive goods thereby increasing the relative demand for skilled labor. We study the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the share of skilled labor in total wages in Mexico using state-level data on two-digit industries from the Industrial Census for the period 1975 to 1988. We measure the state- level growth in FDI using data on the regional activities of foreign- owned assembly plants. We find that growth in FDI is positively correlated with the relative demand for skilled labor. In the regions where FDI has been most concentrated, growth in FDI can account for over 50 percent of the increase in the skilled labor share of total wages that occurred during the late 1980s.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Feenstra, Robert C. & Hanson, Gordon H., 1997.

Journal of International Economics,"Exporters, skill upgrading, and the wage gap","['Bernard, Andrew B.', 'Jensen, J. Bradford']",This paper examines plant level evidence on the increase in demand for non-production workers in U.S. manufacturing during the 1980's. The major finding is that increases in employment at exporting plants contribute heavily to the observed increase in relative demand for skilled labor in manufacturing during the period. Exporters account for almost all of the increase in the wage gap between high and low-skilled workers. Tests of the competing theories with plant level data show that demand changes associated with increased exports are strongly associated with the wage gap increases. Increases in plant technology are determinants of within plant skill-upgrading but not of the aggregate wage gap rise.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.),"Bernard, Andrew B. & Jensen, J.

Journal of International Economics,Strategic trade policy with incompletely informed policymakers,"['Brainard, S. Lael', 'Martimort, David']","Ever since the inception of research on strategic trade policy, economists have warned that the informational requirements are high, and unlikely to be met in practice. This paper investigates the implications of incomplete information for a simple, rent-shifting trade policy of the type proposed in Brander-Spencer (1985). We find that asymmetric information undermines the precommitrnent effect of unilateral government intervention. This ""screening"" effect induces a downward distortion in the optimal subsidy, and it may be so great as to require a tax rather than a subsidy for high levels of uncertainty, given a zero-profit participation constraint. Second, in contrast to the full-information case with strategic substitutes, the introduction of a rival interventionist government reinforces rather than countervails the precommitment effect, by reducing the incentive for the domestic firm to misrepresent its private information. Finally, when a nonintervention-profit participation constraint is substituted for the conventional zero-profit participation constraint to take into account the special relationship between firms and policymakers in trade, the government eschews intervention altogether for high levels of uncertainty.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Brainard, S.

Ceilings on allowable contributions per industry may be welfare-worsening, particularly if the ""contributor elasticity"" is high, because they induce candidates to seek additional contributors. Restrictions that reduce the number of industries allowed to contribute may also worsen welfare, because candidates respond by increasing contributions (and tariff protection) for each active contributor.

We model copperation in multilateral trade policy as self-enforcing, in that it involves balancing the current gains from deviating unilaterally from an agreed-upon trade policy against the future losses from forfeiting the benefits of multilateral cooperation that such a unilateral defection would imply. The early stages of the process union formation are shown to alter this dynamic incentive constraint in a way that leads to a temporary ""honeymoon"" for liberal multilateral trade policies. We find, however, that the harmony between customs unions and multilateral liberalization is temporary: Eventually, as the full impact of the emerging customs union becomes felt, a less favorable balance between current and future conditions reemerges, and the liberal multilateral polices of the honeymoon phase cannot be sustained. We argue that this is compatible with the evolving implications of the formation of the European Community customs union for the ability to sustain liberal multilateral trade policies under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Bagwell, Kyle & Staiger, Robert W., 1997.

Journal of International Economics,The political economy of declining industries: Senescent industry collapse revisited,"['Brainard, S. Lael', 'Verdier, Thierry']","One of the most robust empirical regularities in the political economy of trade is the persistence of protection. This paper explains persistent protection in terms of the interaction between industry adjustment, lobbying, and the political response. Faced with a trade shock, owners of industry-specific factors can undertake costly adjustment, or they can lobby politicians for protection and thereby mitigate the need for adjustment. The choice depends on the returns from adjusting relative to lobbying. By introducing an explicit lobbying process, it can be shown that the level of tariffs is an increasing function of past tariffs. Since current adjustment diminishes future lobbying intensity, and protection reduces adjustment, current protection raises future protection. This simple lobbying feedback effect has an important dynamic resource allocation effect: declining industries contract more slowly over time and never fully adjust. In addition, the model makes clear that the type of collapse predicted by Cassing and Hillman (1986) is only possible under special conditions, such as a fixed cost to lobbying. The paper also considers the symmetric case of lobbying in growing industries.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Brainard, S. Lael & Verdier, Thierry, 1997.

Journal of International Economics,Monetary policy in the end-game to exchange-rate based stabilizations: the case of Mexico,"['Kamin, Steven B.', 'Rogers, John H.']","Exchange-rate based stabilizations, while useful in accelerating the disinflation process, typically lead to overvalued exchange rates and large current account deficits. These factors, in turn, make it difficult to sustain exchange rate pegs, placing heaving demands upon monetary policy to sustain exchange-rate based programs in their later phases. This paper evaluates the extent to which Mexican monetary policy in 1994 may have loosened, or not tightened sufficiently, in the lead up to the devaluation of the peso that December. Using econometric models of the demand for money, we find evidence that the high growth of the monetary base in 1994 reflected strong positive shocks to the demand for money, not to its supply. Next, we estimate a monetary policy reaction function for Mexico. Based on this estimate, we argue that interest rates rose only moderately less in 1994, in response to downward pressure on the peso and on international reserves, than was predicted by the authorities' reaction function. This result is qualified somewhat by our finding that if interest rates are modeled as reacting to reserves net of Tesobonos, rather than gross reserves, the measured deviation of actual from predicted interest rates would have been much greater. However, the relative complacency with which both the authorities and the market viewed the build-up in Tesobonos, at least until late in 1994, suggests that the reaction function based on net reserves probably does not capture \""normal\"" monetary policy behavior. Our findings suggest that in order to have maintained the peg, the authorities would have needed to intensify their response to exchange market developments--that is, to alter their reaction function--at a time when concerns over the health of the banking sector, and of the economy more generally, would have pointed to a relaxation of monetary policy.

We define a currency crash as a large change of the nominal exchange rate that is also a substantial increase in the rate of change of the nominal depreciation. We examine the composition of the debt as well as its level, and a variety of other macroeconomic, external and foreign factors. Our factors are significantly related to crash incidence, especially output growth, the rate of change of domestic credit, and foreign interest rates. A low ratio of FDI to debt is consistently associated with a high likelihood of a crash.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Frankel, Jeffrey A. & Rose, Andrew K., 1996.

Using Compustat data on all U.S. semiconductor firms, we estimate the effects of Sematech on members' R&D spending, profitability, investment, and productivity. In so doing we test two hypotheses: the `commitment' hypothesis that Sematech obligates member firms to spend more on high- spillover R&D, and the `sharing' hypothesis that Sematech reduces duplication of member R&D spending. Whereas the commitment hypothesis provides a rationale for the government subsidies, the sharing hypothesis does not. We find that Sematech induced members to cut their overall R&D spending on the order of $300 million per year, providing support for the sharing hypothesis.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Irwin, Douglas A. & Klenow, Peter J., 1996.

Despite very different economic conditions and levels of development, we find one fact which is robust across all three countries: higher levels of foreign investment are associated with higher wages. In Mexico and Venezuela, foreign investment was associated with higher wages only for foreign-owned firms -- there is no evidence of wage spillovers leading to higher wages for domestic firms. In the United States there is evidence of wage spillovers. The lack of spillovers in Mexico and Venezuela is consistent with significant wage differentials between foreign and domestic enterprises.

Journal of International Economics,Commercial policy and dynamic adjustment under monopolistic competition,"['Keuschnigg, Christian', 'Kohler, Wilhelm']","We assess some likely consequences of commercial policy in an intertemporal CGE model of an imperfectly competitive, small open economy. Specifically, we combine an overlapping generations model of aggregate savings with capital accumulation by forward-looking investors and production under monopolistic competition and increasing returns to scale. The model replicates Austrian data. We find that unilateral tariff cuts have an expansionary effect resulting both in rationalization of industrial production and in new products supplied by new firms entering the market. Small export subsidies are self financing. The expansionary effects and the welfare increases get magnified under monopolistic competition when compared with a more competitive case. Although all generations are able to participate in the efficiency gains, we note uneven generational gains. Finally, we report large overshooting in the net asset position which we attribute to a life-cycle type savings mechanism.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Keuschnigg, Christian & Kohler, Wilhelm, 1996.

Journal of International Economics,Evaluating debt repurchases What are the alternatives to investment?,"['Cabral, Celia C.']","In this paper a general model of debt repurchases is built which reconciles most of the points raised in the literature on debt buybacks. It is shown that results previously found in the literature can be obtained from this general model and are strongly dependant on assumptions made on its parameters. The condition that determines whether or not buybacks are an attractive solution from the point of the debtor nations is derived. Additionally it is shown that if there are other assets safer than investment, a debt buyback will always lead to an increase in investment and a reduction in the holdings of such other assets. This result holds independently of the source of the resources used for the buyback, unlike previous suggestions. With a buyback out of current resources, optimal reserves levels fall by more than what is used for the buyback, releasing extra resources for investment purposes, while current consumption does not fall.

Under fairly general assumptions we show that pass-through should be high for exporters based in a country with a very large share of total destination market sales. For source countries with small and intermediate market shares, the theoretical relationship is potentially nonlinear and sensitive to assumptions about the nature of consumer demand and firm interactions. The model is estimated using a panel data set of automobile exports from France, Germany, Sweden, and the United States to a variety of destinations over the period 1970-88. The empirical relationship between pass-through and market share is significantly nonlinear: pass-through is lowest when the source country's market share is around 45 percent and it is highest when the source country's share approaches 100 percent.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Feenstra, Robert C. & Gagnon, Joseph E. & Knetter, Michael M., 1996.

The long samples required for statistical significance are unavailable for most currencies, however, and may be inappropriate because of regime changes. In this study, we re-examine deviations from PPP using a panel of 150 countries and 45 annual observations. Our panel shows strong evidence of mean-reversion that is similar to that from long time-series. PPP deviations are eroded at a rate of approximately 15% annually, i.e. their half-life is around four years. Such findings can be masked in time-series data, but are relatively easy to find in cross-sections.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Frankel, Jeffrey A. & Rose, Andrew K., 1996.

Journal of International Economics,'Secret' buy-backs of LDC debt,"['Cohen, Daniel', 'Verdier, Thierry']","We analyse the buy-back of its debt by an LDC. Contrary to the analyses that were previously done on this subject, we assume that the debtor can hide its transactions behind the veil of a fictitious operator: the banks, we assume, cannot discriminate intra-bank transactions from buy-backs by the debtor itself. With this assumption, the lenders set the price by (rationally) taking account of the country's incentive to repurchase its debt. Will the debtor undertake a buy-back of its debt? The answer is a qualified yes. Large buy-backs will take place. With a continuum of debtors (whose cash constraints are not perfectly known to the banks), the rich debtors will attempt to repurchase as much of their debt as their cash constraint allows them to. This is shown to be Pareto-improving for both the banks and the debtor country.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This ab(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Cohen, Daniel & Verdier, Thierry, 1995.

Journal of International Economics,Industrial location and public infrastructure,"['Martin, Philippe', 'Rogers, Carol Ann']","This paper examines the impact of public infrastructure on industrial location when increasing returns are present. Poor infrastructure implies costs of Samuelson's `iceberg' form and alter trade both within and between countries. Trade integration implies that firms tend to locate in countries with better infrastructure so that regional policies that affect the level of public infrastructure influence economic geography. The effectiveness of such policies decreases when infrastructure improves, however, because a high level of infrastructure and strong economies of scale magnify the concentration effects of differentials in infrastructure, market size and capital-labour ratios. Infrastructure policies that facilitate intra-regional trade in the poor country lead to regional convergence but policies that facilitate intra-regional trade lead to regional divergence. We also analyse the incentives for countries to inhibit industrial relocation.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Martin, Philippe & Rogers, Carol Ann, 1995.

Journal of International Economics,"Capital goods imports, the real exchange rate and the current account","['Serven, Luis']","Conventional aggregate models of open economies typically rule out trade in capital goods. But capital goods account for a major share of the world trade. In 1990, they represented more than 40 percent of U.S. merchandise exports and more than 30 percent of its imports. In the same year, capital goods imports represented an average of roughly 30 of total imports for 82 industrial and developing countries, and almost 9 percent of their GDP. This report shows that the presence of imported capital goods greatly changes the short- and long-run effects of macoreconomic policies and external shocks on key macroeconomic variables. Using a rational-expectations aggregate model with intertemporally optimizing agents and with trade in both consumption and capital goods, it finds that the long-run equilibrium of the economy displays a negative relationship between the real exchange rate and real output - that is, a real appreciation is associated with an increase in long-run output and the capital stock. With investment subject to adjustment costs, the response to unanticipated permanent disturbances involves a changing real exchange rate and a non-zero current account. The author analyzes the macroeconomic consequences of changes infiscal policy and of transfers of wealth from abroad. He show that both have well-defined long-run effects on the capital stock and real output. Fiscal expansion, in particular, may have a long-run crowding-in effect on investment. By constrast, the impact of disturbances on the current account is ambiguous. The author shows that it depends critically on the degree of intertemporal substitutability in both consumption and investment - with the latter measured by the magnitude of investment adjustment costs.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Serven, Luis, 1995.

Journal of International Economics,Information sharing and tax competition among governments,"['Bacchetta, Philippe', 'Espinosa, Maria Paz']","The residence-based principle has been proposed as a second-best measure to the full international coordination of capital tax policies. A basic requirement for this system to work is that tax authorities have full information about the foreign investments of their residents. The degree of information transmission among governments can be considered as a variable used strategically in the same way taxes are, however. We show that under some features of the tax system there will not be any information sharing, while there are institutional arrangements under which governments will transmit partial information for strategic purposes. We also show that full information sharing is not necessarily a Pareto optimum. Our conclusion is that the informational behaviour of governments is crucial and should be taken into account when designing the optimal international tax system.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Bacchetta, Philippe & Espinosa, Maria Paz, 1995.

On average. manufacturing sectors have evolved from being primarily export exposed in the 1970s to being primarily import exposed by the early 1980s. Due to this pattern in exposure. exchange rate appreciations reduced investment in durable goods sectors in the 1970s and stimulated investment after 1983.

Journal of International Economics,Exchange rate regimes and trade prices Does the EMS matter?,"['Sapir, Andre', 'Sekkat, Khalid']","This paper investigates the role of the exchange rate regime in the process of trade adjustment, by examining the relationship between trade prices and exchange rate regimes. The theoretical framework is a dynamic one à la Froot-Klemperer (1989). The empirical investigation takes advantage of the simultaneous occurrence, since 1979, of relatively stable exchange rates inside the ERM and instable rates outside to engage in a controlled experiment on the impact of the exchange rate regime on trade prices. The results suggest that a system of pegged rates like the EMS, although helpful, is not necessary to achieve a smooth process of trade adjustment. It appears that the absence of misalignment rather than the type of exchange rate regime is the crucial factor for fulfilling such an objective.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Sapir, Andre & Sekkat, Khalid, 1995.

Journal of International Economics,Cost asymmetries in international subsidy games: Should governments help winners or losers?,"['Neary, J. Peter']","This paper examines the optimality of export subsidies in oligopolistic markets, when home and foreign firms have different costs and there is an opportunity cost to public funds. Subsidies are found to be optimal only for surprisingly low values of the shadow price of government funds, and if subsidies are justified they should be higher the more cost-competitive are domestic firms. These results hold under both Cournot competition and Bertrand competition when firms move before governments. The results suggest that recent arguments for export subsidies apply only for firms that would be highly profitable even without subsidies.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Neary, J.

Journal of International Economics,Trade adjustment assistance and Pareto gains from trade,"['Feenstra, Robert C.', 'Lewis, Tracy R.']","In a model where all factors of production are imperfectly mobile, we argue that the Dixit-Norman scheme of commodity taxes may not lead to strict Pareto gains from trade. Rather, this scheme must be augmented by policies which give factors an incentive to move: hence, the role for trade adjustment assistance (TAA). We demonstrate that by knowledge of the distribution of adjustment costs across individuals, the government can offer a single TAA subsidy to all individuals willing to move between industries, and maintain a non-negative budget. The TAA subsidy, combined with the Dixit-Norman pattern of commodity taxes, can lead to Pareto gains from trade under the conditions we identify.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Feenstra, Robert C. & Lewis, Tracy R., 1994.

Journal of International Economics,The real exchange rate and foreign direct investment in the United States : Relative wealth vs. relative wage effects,"['Klein, Michael W.', 'Rosengren, Eric']",There has been a significant correlation between United States inward foreign direct investment and the United States real exchange rate since the 1970s. Two alternative reasons for this relationship are that the real exchange rate affects the relative cost of labor and that the real exchange rate alters relative wealth across countries. In this paper we explore these alternatives by examining the determinants of four measures of inward foreign direct investment to the United States from seven industrial countries over the period 1979 to 1991. We find strong evidence that relative wealth significantly affects U.S. inward foreign direct investment. We find no evidence that relative wages have a significant impact on the determination of U.S. foreign direct investment. These results are robust to the choice of countries in our sample and when controlling for changes in tax codes.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.),"Klein, Michael W. & Rosengren, Eric, 1994.

The forces contributing to speculative attacks on the Mexican peso include internal money creation, external credit shocks, and relative price shocks. The framework proves highly successful for generating forecasts of the probability of speculative attacks on the peso and for predicting lower bounds for post- collapse exchange rates using a range of assumptions about critical levels of central bank reserve floors. Simulation results suggest that reducing domestic credit growth, increasing the uncertainty surrounding this growth, and reducing the size and perhaps increasing the frequency of currency realignments might have greatly reduced the amount of currency speculation against the peso in some of the crisis periods between 1980 and 1986.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Goldberg, Linda S., 1994.

Journal of International Economics,The sensitivity of strategic and corrective R&D policy in oligopolistic industries,"['Bagwell, Kyle', 'Staiger, Robert W.']","We evaluate the sensitivity of the case for an R&D subsidy in an export sector when the outcome of R&D is uncertain and when the resulting product market is oligopolistic. Investments in R&D are assumed to induce either first order or mean-preserving second order shifts in the distribution of a firm's costs, with firms then competing in either prices or quantities in the product market. When R&D reduces the mean of a firm's cost distribution in the particular sense of first order stochastic dominance, we find using standard models of product market competition that a national strategic basis for R&D subsidies exists, whether firms choose prices or quantities. This national strategic incentive to subsidize R&D must be balanced against the national corrective incentive to tax R&D that arises whenever the number of domestic firms exceeds one. However, when R & D preserves the mean but alters the riskiness of a firm's cost distribution in the sense of second order stochastic dominance, we find that the national strategic basis for R&D intervention completely disappears, while the national corrective incentive is now to subsidize R&D whenever the number of domestic firms exceeds one. We conclude that the crucial determinant of appropriate R&D policy is the nature of the R&D process itself.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed (This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Bagwell, Kyle & Staiger, Robert W., 1994.

Using Dixit and Norman's integrated world economy (IWE), two sets, called lenses, are constructed: one spanned by the factor vectors used to produce goods in the IWE; the other spanned by the countries' factor endowments. If the factor-endowment lens ever passes outside the factor-use lens, then FPE is impossible. In this sense, therefore, FPE requires that factor endowments vary less across countries than factor intensities vary across industries.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This ab(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Deardorff, Alan V., 1994.

Journal of International Economics,Learning about intervention target zones,"['Klein, Michael W.', 'Lewis, Karen K.']","This paper provides a framework for evaluating how market participants' beliefs about foreign exchange target zones change as they learn about central bank intervention policy. In order to examine this behavior, we first generalize the standard target zone model to allow for intra-marginal intervention. Intra-marginal intervention implies that the position of market participants' beliefs about the target zone can be determined from their beliefs about the likelihood of intervention. As an application of this model, we estimate a probability of intervention model using daily exchange rates and market observations of central bank interventions following the Louvre Accord. Interestingly, even over this relatively stable Louvre Accord period, we find that the market's views of intervention target zones would have varied quite a bit over time.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Klein, Michael W. & Lewis, Karen K., 1993.

Journal of International Economics,Testing the imports-as-market-discipline hypothesis,"['Levinsohn, James']","It has long been believed that international competition forces domestic firms to behave more competitively. I term this the imports-as--market-discipline hypothesis. I construct a simple static oligopoly model and estimate the model using panel data from Turkish manufacturing firms. The data span the course of a dramatic trade liberalization. Looking for changes in price-marginal cost markups as trade policy shifts, I test the imports-as-market discipline hypothesis. In all five industries to which the hypothesis is relevant, markups change in the direction predicted by the theory. These changes are statistically significant in all but one of the five industries.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Levinsohn, James, 1993.

To illustrate how to estimate a utility based criterion, we use five bilateral weekly dollar exchange rates, 1973-1989, and the corresponding pair of Eurodeposit rates. Of homoskedastic, GARCH, autoregressive and nonparametric models for the conditional variance of each exchange rate, GARCH models tend to produce the highest utility, on average.

Journal of International Economics,Monetary contracting between central banks and the design of sustainable exchange-rate zones,"['Delgado, Francisco', 'Dumas, Bernard']","An exchange-rate system is a set of contracts which commits central banks to intervene in the foreign-exchange market. The design features of the system include: the rules of intervention, the limits placed on exchange rates and the ""crisis scenario"" which describes possible transitions to new regimes in case one central bank runs out of reserves or borrowing capacity. This paper considers the various trade-offs one faces in designing an exchange-rate system. Svensson (1989) has already analyzed the degree of variability in the exchange rate, the interest rate and the fundamentals. But the tradeoff also pertains to the amount of reserves which the central banks must have on hand in order to forestall a speculative attack and make the system sustainable. The amount of reserves needed depends crucially on the assured crisis scenario.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Delgado, Francisco & Dumas, Bernard, 1993.

Journal of International Economics,Channels of international policy transmission,"['van der Ploeg, Frederick']","A two-country, intertemporal, perfect-foresight model with micro foundations, floating exchange rates, uncovered interest parity, and nominal wage rigidities is formulated. The benchmark case corresponds to unit elasticities of intertemporal and intratemporal substitution in consumption, no initial holdings of foreign assets and infinite lifetimes. Monetary disinflation and an increase in government spending then have no spillover effects on foreign consumption and employment and there are no current account dynamics. Four channels of international policy transmission are then analysed. The first is based on capital gains on holdings of foreign assets. The spillover effects arising through the second and third channel depend on whether goods are gross substitutes or gross complements and on whether the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is less or greater than unity. The final channel assumes finite lifetimes and no bequest motive. It departs from debt neutrality in order to allow wealth effects and current account dynamics to play a more interesting role and to assess the difference between tax and debt finance.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","van der Ploeg, Frederick, 1993.

Journal of International Economics,Exchange rate variability and the level of international trade,"['Gagnon, Joseph E.']","There have been numerous theoretical and empirical studies of the effect of exchange rate variability on the level of international trade. Most theoretical studies have concluded that under reasonable assumptions exchange rate variability ought to depress the level of trade. Empirical studies generally have not identified a significant effect of exchange rate variability on trade flows. This paper builds a theoretical model in which exchange rate variability has a negative effect on the level of trade. The model is calibrated to observed trade flows and real exchange rates. Simulation of the model demonstrates that the effect of increasing exchange rate variability on trade flows is very small. These results are not sensitive to a wide range of parameter values. Moreover, reasonable extensions of the model only serve to minimize further the effect of exchange rate variability on trade flows.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Gagnon, Joseph E., 1993.

Journal of International Economics,Endogenous protection and trade diversion,"['Richardson, Martin']",Traditional positive analysis of preferential trading areas has focused on the trade-offs between (beneficial) trade creation and (potentially harmful) trade diversion. We consider the latter phenomenon in the formation of a free-trade area (FTA) between countries where tariffs against non-members are set endogenously. We show that such tariffs will fall consequent to the formation of FTAs and trade diversion is likely to become trade creation. This is illustrated in a model in which tariffs are levied to maximize a political support function.

Journal of International Economics,A valuation formula for LDC debt,"['Cohen, Daniel']","A large gap may lie between the amount of debt relief that is nominally granted to a debtor and that which is actually given up by the creditors. To help put that gap in perspective, the author proposes a valuation formula that provides: (i) the price at which a buy-back of the debt, on the secondary market, is advantageous to the country; (ii) the value to creditors of having the flows of payment guaranteed against factors that hinder a country in servicing its debt; and (iii) the degree of tradeoff between growth of payments and levels of payments. The author argues that it is not good business for a country to announce its intention to buy back debt, because doing so immediately raises the price. The value of guarantees, the author argues, cannot exceed 25 percent of the market price of the debt. Typically they're worth only about 10 percent. As for the degree of tradeoff, the author's formula finds that 1 percent additional growth rate is worth a 15 percent increase in the flows of payments. An assessment of the Mexican debt-relief agreement reached in 1990 is also offered.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Cohen, Daniel, 1993.

Journal of International Economics,Debt write-downs and debt--equity swaps in a two-sector model,"['Goldberg, Linda', 'Spiegel, Mark M.']","""Debt overhang"" models have motivated the possibility of Pareto-improving ""market-based debt-reduction schemes"" under an assumption of creditor seizure in bad states. These models usually reach the conclusion that while pure debt forgiveness is in the interest of debtor nations, debt repurchase programs are not. This paper introduces a ""safe sector"" into the debtor nation which is unexposed to seizure during default states. Two important results which emerge are that debt forgiveness is not necessarily in the interest of all debtors, and the potential for Pareto-improving debt-equity swaps is magnified.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Goldberg, Linda & Spiegel, Mark M., 1992.

However, only one-third of antidumping cases actually result in dumping duties being levied. Surprisingly, nearly as many antidumping cases are withdrawn or are voluntarily terminated. We present data that show that these withdrawn cases have at least as great an effect on trade as cases which resulted in duties. We discuss legal reasons why such settlements are possible and present a model of the bargaining process. We find that petitions with low probability of success (‘nuisance’ suits) actually confer large gains to both domestic and foreign firms.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Prusa, Thomas J., 1992.

In contrast to previous literature, the exchange rate's heteroscedasticity within the band, as well as a separate devaluation/realignment risk, is taken into account. The risk premium is then the sum of two separate risk premia, arising from stochastic exchange rate movements within the band and from stochastic devaluations/realignments when the bank is shifted. Both real and nominal exchange rate premia are considered. The real and nominal risk premia from movements within the band are very small for narrow target zones and can therefore be disregarded. The real and nominal risk premia from devaluations/realignments are larger but still relatively small proportions of the expected rate of devaluation/realignment.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Svensson, Lars E.

Journal of International Economics,Where does the meteor shower come from? : The role of stochastic policy coordination,"['Ito, Takatoshi', 'Engle, Robert F.', 'Lin, Wen-Ling']","The purpose of this paper is to examine the intra-daily volatility of the yen/dollar exchange rate over three different regimes from 1979 to 1988 which correspond to different degrees of international policy coordination. In each regime we test for heat wave vs. meteor shower effects. The heat wave hypothesis assumes that volatility has only country specific autocorrelations, while the meteor shower hypothesis allows volatility spillovers from one market to the next. Meteor showers can be caused by stochastic policy coordination, by gradual release of private information, or by market failures such as fads, bubbles or bandwagons. The rejection of the heat wave model over the first half of the 1980s discredits the stochastic policy coordination interpretation because there was little policy coordination among industrial countries prior to the Plaza Agreement in 1985.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Ito, Takatoshi & Engle, Robert F. & Lin, Wen-Ling, 1992.

Journal of International Economics,The effect of domestic antidumping law in the presence of foreign monopoly,"['Staiger, Robert W.', 'Wolak, Frank A.']","We consider the effects of antidumping law when utilized by competitive domestic petitioners against a foreign monopolist. The foreign monopolist must set capacity before the realization of random foreign demand, but can reduce the cost of holding excess capacity in periods of slack foreign demand by dumping on the domestic market. With the introduction of antidumping law in the domestic market, domestic firms are shown to file suits in periods of sufficiently slack foreign demand, reducing the volume of imports directly in such periods. Moreover, this occasional filing activity raises the cost to the foreign monopolist of holding excess capacity and, in so doing, results in a scaling back of foreign capacity. Thus, the volume of imports is generally reduced by the introduction of domestic antidumping law, even in periods where no suit is filed. Finally. we consider self-enforcing agreements between the domestic industry and the foreign monopolist that take the form of a promise by the domestic industry not to file in exchange for a promise by the foreign monopolist to export no more than a pre-specified amount: We show that these agreements narrow the range of demand states over which suits are filed to only the softest states of demand, and lead to greater foreign capacity, hence partially mitigating both the direct and indirect impact of antidumping law on trade volume.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Staiger, Robert W. & Wolak, Frank A., 1992.

Journal of International Economics,Trade and protection in vertically related markets,"['Spencer, Barbara J.', 'Jones, Ronald W.']","A domestic firm is partially dependent on a foreign vertically integrated supplier for a key intermediate product when both firms are Cournot competitors in the market for the final product. The foreign supplier generally charges its domestic rival a price for the input that exceeds the independent monopoly level and vertical foreclosure may occur. Domestic policies applied to the vertically related products can increase domestic welfare by reducing the price and increasing the availability of imported supplies of the input. Vertical integration in the foreign supplier has significant implications for all three domestic policies considered: a tariff or subsidy on imports of both products and a domestic production subsidy. The foreign vertically integrated firm tends to reduce its price for the input in response to an import tariff on the final product, whereas a simple monopoly supplier would respond by increasing its export price. Also domestic cost conditions for the production of the input can critically affect the desirability of a tax as apposed to a subsidy on intermediate imports.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Spencer, Barbara J. & Jones, Ronald W., 1992.

We examine exchange rate dynamics in cases where the authorities promise (i) to confine a floating rate within a predetermined range, (ii) to peg the currency once it reaches a predetermined future level, and (iii) to unify a system of dual exchange rates. Similarities between these and several related examples of regime switching are stressed. We also discuss how stochastic regime changes can affect some standard statistical tests of hypotheses about exchange rates.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Froot, Kenneth A. & Obstfeld, Maurice, 1991.

Journal of International Economics,The effects of trade reforms on scale and technical efficiency : New evidence from Chile,"['Tybout, James', 'de Melo, Jamie', 'Corbo, Vittorio']","This paper shows how the industrial structure and performance changed after Chile's dramatic trade liberalization. A comparison of the 1967 and 1979 censuses shows little improvement in productivity overall, but these figures don't separate the effects of trade liberalization from the effects of recession, high interest rates, and real appreciation. To isolate the effects of trade liberalization, the authors compared industries in which protection was significantly reduced with industries in which it was not. It was found that of the industries for which protection was lifted, the smallest plants tended to expand output more. Cross-plant estimates of returns to scale dropped significantly. These findings are consistent with the view that exposure to foreign competition forces suboptimally small producers toward minimally efficient scale. Also, production levels became higher and more uniform across plants in those industries undergoing dramatic reductions in protection. Taken together, these results support the received wisdom that increased exposure to trade improves competition within an industry.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Tybout, James & de Melo, Jamie & Corbo, Vittorio, 1991.

Trade policy is modelled as a multistage game. At the first stage the foreign country sets its export subsidy, and then at the second stage the domestic country sets its tariff and/or production subsidy. If the domestic country pursues an optimal trade policy then it will always gain from a foreign export subsidy. When the domestic country uses a tariff and a production subsidy, the optimal foreign policy is an export subsidy.

Journal of International Economics,"Trade dependency, bargaining and external debt","['Aizenman, Joshua']","This paper analyzes the factors determining the effective payment on outstanding debt in the presence of partial defaults, and the feasibility of renewed investment. We show that the bargaining outcome, which determines the repayment, is dictated by the trade dependency, as measured by the substitutability of domestic and foreign products. A higher relative size of sectors with lower substitutability between domestic and foreign products will increase the trade dependency of the nation, reducing its bargaining power arid thereby increasing the resource transfer ceiling. The resultant increase in the ceiling makes the nation less risky, increasing the willingness of creditors to lend. Thus, while a strategy of outward growth has the cost of increasing trade dependency, it has the benefit of increasing the availability of external finance. Even with a partial default, investment in highly trade dependent sectors with high productivity may be warranted. This investment can be implemented by a marginal relief of the present debt service, in exchange for investment in the proper sector. Following such a scheme may require a detailed conditionality as well as careful monitoring. A way to partially overcome some of the monitoring problems is through direct investment.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Aizenman, Joshua, 1991.

Journal of International Economics,Capital accumulation and the current account in a two-country model,"['Devereux, Michael B.', 'Shi, Shouyong']","This paper looks at the joint determination of international indebtedness and capital accumulation in a two-country model. National rates of time preference are endogenous, and adjust along an optimal path to come into equality with one another in the steady state. A country's level of indebtedness is positively related to its degree of 'impatience', and its technology advantage, and negatively related to the share of government spending in GDP. Steady state creditor countries tend to have current account surpluses during episodes of world output growth, and vice versa for debtor countries. This gives rise to a possible nonmonotonic adjustment in the current account and in consumption.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Devereux, Michael B. & Shi, Shouyong, 1991.

Journal of International Economics,"Patents, appropriate technology, and North-South trade","['Diwan, Ishac', 'Rodrik, Dani']","In this paper, the authors discuss the possibility that the North and South may have differing technological needs. Just as the North would like to develop drugs against cancer and heart disease, and the South drugs against tropical disease, so the North's labor saving innovations are less useful in the South, where labor is cheap. Southern patents might promote the development of technologies appropriate to the South that might not have been developed if there were no patents. In this case, lower patent protection in the South would not benefit the South and increased patent protection in the South can hurt the North when the resources to go into R&D are limited. The authors develop a formal model for inteellectual property rights, emphasizing the dimension of technological choice. This model allows for a continuum of potential technologies, with a range of preferences in the North and South; free entry in the R&D sector rather than duopolistic competition; and gradations of patent protection. The report concludes by reviewing the results of the analysis.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Diwan, Ishac & Rodrik, Dani, 1991.

Journal of International Economics,A positive theory of foreign currency debt,"['Bohn, Henning']","The paper makes a case for foreign currency debt as a hedging device in an open economy subject to stochastic shocks to output. A government can reduce uncertainty in net wealth and in consumption by issuing foreign or domestic currency debt, if unexpected domestic and foreign inflation are negatively correlated with domestic output. Foreign currency debt is desirable in comparison to domestic currency debt, if growth rates of output of both countries are closely related and if domestic inflation is relatively uncertain. In addition, foreign currency debt replaces domestic currency debt as hedge, whenever issuing domestic debt is prevented or discouraged by incentive problems. It also shows that time-consistency problems may motivate capital controls or taxes on international borrowing.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Bohn, Henning, 1990.

Journal of International Economics,International capacity choice and national market games,"['Venables, Anthony J.']","A series of models are developed in which international trade is modelled as a two-stage game between firms in two countries. At the first stage firms choose their productive capacity. At the second stage different types of market game are played. The most interesting case is that in which firms play a separate price game in each national market, given their worldwide capacity levels. It is established that (i) firms use capacity strategically, in order to manipulate the distribution of rivals' output between markets; (ii) the volume of intra-industry trade is intermediate between the two cases most extensively studied in the trade literature (integrated- and segmented-market Cournot equilibria); and (iii) countries gain from small import tariffs and export subsidies, but these gains are less than in the case of segmented markets and a Cournot equilibrium.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Venables, Anthony J., 1990.

Journal of International Economics,Tariffs with private information and reputation,"['Jensen, Richard', 'Thursby, Marie']","When governments choose trade policy, rarely do they have complete information, At the time decisions are made, policy makers have only estimates of market responses, as well as the responses of foreign governments. In many realistic situations, even the policy objectives of other governments may not be known. For example, the balance of constitutional powers in the United States is often cited as a source of confusion as to objectives of U.S. trade policy. In this paper we examine the Bayesian Nash equilibria of several noncooperative tariff games with incomplete information, In the models examined, the home country has private information about whether its government is a low or high tariff type. If the foreign government is uncertain about this type in a one-shot game, its Nash equilibrium tariff will be lower (higher) than if it knew the home government were a low (high) tariff type. In two multistage games, misleading behavior by the home government is shown to be an equilibrium strategy for sufficiently high discount factors. Whether the uncertainty is persistent or can be resolved is shown to be important for welfare results in the multistage setting. In the models examined, tariff rules do not necessarily dominate discretionary policy.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Jensen, Richard & Thursby, Marie, 1990.

Journal of International Economics,Cash/debt buy-backs and the insurance value of reserves,"['Van Wijnbergen, Sweder']","Bulow and Rogoff showed in 1988 that auction based purchases of debt could not be an effective way to capture the secondary market discount, since the purchase pushes up the secondary market afterward. The author of this report points out another problem with cash debt buy backs - one that arises because terms of trade contingent instruments do not exist in international capital markets, and because of the differences in risk aversion that one may plausibly assume to exist between commercial creditors and the developing countries that are their debtor clients. Under such circumstances, secondary market prices fail to reflect the insurance value reserves have to debtors but not to creditors - since, after all, the secondary market reflects mostly intrabank transactions. As a result, the country buying back debt with reserves clearly ends up worse off, even if it succeeds in capturing the full secondary market discount prevailing before the buyback - because the buyback reduces the insurance possibilities open to the country.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Van Wijnbergen, Sweder, 1990.

The model is characterized by rational expectations, sticky prices, imperfect capital substitution, separate policy functions for domestic credit and reserves, and variable sterilization. The most important implications of the model are that (1) monetary, exchange rate, and variable sterilization policies may be used to pursue tradeoffs between internal and external objectives; and (2) these tradeoffs are nonlinear functions of the policies chosen (e.g., partial sterilization is not a simple linear interpolation of complete and zero sterilization).(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Natividad, Fidelina & Stone, Joe A., 1990.

Journal of International Economics,Domestic politics and the international coordination of fiscal policies,"['Tabellini, Guido']","This paper investigates the desirability of international fiscal policy coordination in the presence of a domestic political distortion. The domestic distortion results from the inability of the current policy-maker to enter into a binding agreement with future policy-makers about the composition of public spending. This distortion generates a bias towards budget deficits. International coordination can exacerbate this bias, and thus reduce social welfare at home and abroad. The reason is that international coordination enables the domestic and foreign governments to form a coalition that excludes future policy-makers. This international coalition reduces the cost of running a budget deficit, and thus enhances the adverse effects of the domestic political distortion.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)<(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Tabellini, Guido, 1990.

We show that shifting the composition of government spending affects macroeconomic variables according to the relative factor intensities of tradeable and non-tradeable goods. Adjustments of composition towards non-tradeables will raise (lower) world interest rates if non-tradeables are capital (labor) intensive. The announcement of a future shift towards non-tradeables will induce a current account deficit (surplus) if future interest rates are expected to increase (decrease).

The analysis shows that -- under certain assumptions concerning the shares of tariff revenues, what the countries spend on imports, the punishment structures and the discount factors -- the outcome of the game converges to the equivalent of the cooperative equilibrium, with zero tariffs and optimal monetary policies. It is suggested that the model could be applied to current relations between the US, Germany and Japan.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Basevi, Giorgio & Denicolo, Vincenzo & Delbono, Flavio, 1990.

Journal of International Economics,"External debt, capital flight and political risk","['Alesina, Alberto', 'Tabellini, Guido']","This paper provides an explanation of the simultaneous occurrence in developing countries of a large accumulation of external debt, private capital outflows and relatively low domestic capital formation. We consider a general equilibrium model in which two types of government with conflicting distributional goals randomly alternate in office. Uncertainty over the fiscal policies of future governments generates private capital flight and reduced domestic investment. This political uncertainty also provides the incentives for the current government to over-accumulate external debt. The model also predicts that left-wing governments are more inclined to impose restrictions on capital outflows than right-wing governments. Finally, we examine how political uncertainty affects the risk premium charged by lenders and how debt repudiation may occur after a change of political regime.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Alesina, Alberto & Tabellini, Guido, 1989.

Journal of International Economics,Market power and exchange rate adjustment in the presence of quotas,"['Aizenman, Joshua']","This paper investigates the dependency of the adjustment of prices, exchange rates, and production on the nature of the trade regime. We contrast the adjustment between a quota and a tariff regime for a 'semi-small' economy characterized by monopolistic competitive market structure and short-run nominal contracts under a floating exchange rate regime. Among other issues we focus on the factors determining the behavior of the quota rent and the 'pass- through' of exchange rate adjustment to the domestic prices of importable goods. We demonstrate that the 'pass-through ratio' (measuring the elasticity of the domestic price of importable goods with respect to the exchange rate) is determined by both the commercial policy and by the market power of the various producers. It tends to be higher in a tariff regime because the endogenous adjustment of the quota rent mitigates the 'pass-through'. We also show that the adjustment of the exchange rate tends to be larger in the quota regime than in the tariff regime. In the tariff regime we observe a larger switch of domestic demand relative to the quota regime, and a corresponding smaller exchange rate adjustment. In the quota regime we observe adjustment of the quota rent such as to keep the net domestic demand for foreign goods intact. As a result, the relative price (of the domestic good to the foreign good) facing the foreign consumer adjusts more in the quota regime than in the tariff regime. At the same time the relative price facing domestic consumers in the quota regime adjusts by less than in the tariff regime.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Aizenman, Joshua, 1989.

Journal of International Economics,Symmetric pass-through of tariffs and exchange rates under imperfect competition: An empirical test,"['Feenstra, Robert C.']","This paper examines the effect of tariffs and exchange rates on U.S. prices of Japanese cars, trucks and motorcycles. In particular, we test whether the long run pass-through of tariffs and exchange rates are identical: the symmetry hypothesis. We find that this hypothesis is easily accepted in our sample. We also find that the pass-through relation varies across products, ranging from about 0.6 for trucks to unity for motorcycles. These coefficients have very different implications for trade policy. We explain the results based on demand, cost and institutional conditions in each industry. We also find weak evidence that the pass-through of exchange rates has fallen in more recent years.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Feenstra, Robert C., 1989.

The paper presents a simple, one-sector analytic model which captures the major features of the multi-sector counterpart used in applied models. The paper derives graphical and algebraic solutions to the model and shows that, unlike some earlier external closures, this one gives rise to a well-behaved, price-taking economy. The model is also useful to illustrate the role of elasticities in popular trade-theoretic models that include traded and non-traded goods.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","de Melo, Jaime & Robinson, Sherman, 1989.

Journal of International Economics,The role of export subsidies when product quality is unknown,"['Bagwell, Kyle', 'Staiger, Robert W.']","We explore in this paper the role of export subsidies when goods arriving from foreign countries are initially of unknown quality to domestic consumers, who learn about their quality only through consumption. If, when confronted with such goods, consumers view price as a signal of quality, a role for export subsidies can arise. In particular, we show that absent export subsidies, entry of high quality firms may be blocked by their inability to sell at prices reflecting their true quality. Export subsidies enable high quality producers to begin exporting profitably even while unable to credibly convey their high quality to consumers in the ""introductory"" period. Thus, in breaking the entry barrier for high quality firms, export subsidies can raise average quality in the market and a welfare-improving role for export subsidies emerges. Moreover, even when high quality firms find it possible to signal their high quality to consumers through an introductory pricing strategy, a role for government policy can arise: the signal (low introductory price) represents a transfer of surplus from foreign producers to domestic consumers which, as we show below, can be avoided with an appropriate export tax/subsidy policy.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Bagwell, Kyle & Staiger, Robert W., 1989.

Journal of International Economics,Financial policy and speculative runs with a crawling peg: Argentina 1979-1981,"['Cumby, Robert E.', 'Van Wijnbergen, Sweder']","In this paper we present a model of a balance-of-payments crisis and use it to examine the Argentine experiment with a crawling peg between December 1978 and February 1981. The approach taken allows us to examine the evolution of a crisis when the collapse is not a perfectly-foreseen event. The implementation of the model yields plausible values of the one-month ahead probabilities of a collapse of the crawling peg. The probabilities exhibit a sharp increase in the middle of 1980 and indicate a significant loss of credibility throughout the remainder of the year. The results suggest that viability of an exchange rate regime depends strongly on the domestic credit policy followed by the authorities. If this policy is not consistent with the exchange rate policy pursued by the authorities, confidence in the exchange rate policy is undermined.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Cumby, Robert E. & Van Wijnbergen, Sweder, 1989.

Journal of International Economics,Taxation of asset income in the presence of a world securities market,"['Gordon, Roger H.', 'Varian, Hal R.']","This paper shows, using a standard CAPM model of security prices in a world market, that even small countries can affect the price of domestically issued risky securities, while large countries can affect the prices of all securities. As a result, countries have the incentive to set tax rates such that in equilibrium investors specialize in domestic securities, and net capital flows between countries are restricted. Each country does this to increase the utility of domestic residents, taking as given the tax policies of other governments, but the net outcome is a reduction in world efficiency and likely a reduction in the utility of all individuals.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Gordon, Roger H. & Varian, Hal R., 1989.

Journal of International Economics,Deterioration of the terms of trade and capital accumulation: A re-examination of the Laursen-Metzler effect,"['Sen, Partha', 'Turnovsky, Stephen J.']","This paper analyzes the effects of both a permanent and a temporary deterioration In the terms of trade on a small open economy. The model, based on intertemporal optimization, emphasizes the labor-leisure choice and the role of capital accumulation There are two main conclusions to be drawn from the analysis. The first 1s that in all cases the transitional dynamics depends critically upon the long-run response of the capital stock to the deterioration m the terms of trade. This has been shown to consist of a substitution effect, which is negative, together with an income effect, which is positive. Secondly, since the steady state equilibrium depends upon the initla1 conditions of the economy, a temporary shock, by altering these initial conditions for some later date when the shock ceases, leads to a permanent effect on the economy. In the case where the substitution effect dominates, a deterioration in the terms of trade leads to a short-run reduction in investment and a short-run current account surplus, contrary to the Laursen-Metzler effect. However, when the long-run income effect dominates, the deterioration m the terms of trade leads to a short-run investment boom, accompanied by a short-term current account deficit. The Laursen-Metzler effect prevails, although it is driven by investment, rather than by savings behavior.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)<(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Sen, Partha & Turnovsky, Stephen J., 1989.

Journal of International Economics,Trade restrictions as facilitating practices,"['Krishna, Kala']","This paper deals with the effect of trade restrictions on competition in oligopolistic markets. Quantitative restrictions, such as VER's (Voluntary Export Restrictions) are shown to affect the extent to which foreign firms can compete in the domestic market, and hence to raise the equilibrium prices and profits of both domestic and foreign firms --when such restrictions are not too severe. This increase in prices and profits is shown to make it unlikely for VER's to raise National Welfare. In addition, I show that domestic output may fall due to the VER's. For these reasons, VER's do not seem to be desirable ways of restricting imports.Tariffs and Quotas are also shown to be non-equivalent in such oligopoly models. A comparison of the effects of tariffs and quotas shows that it would be in the interest of domesti cmanufacturers t lobby for VER's instead of import equivalent tariffs. In addition, it is shown that the foreign firm would prefer VER's to import equivalent tariffs, even if tariff revenues were refunded to them. Thus, the recent VER's on Japanese automobiles may well have been in the interests of both Japanese and American firms, and at the expense of the nation as a whole.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Krishna, Kala, 1989.

Journal of International Economics,"Trade in nominal assets : Monetary policy, and price level and exchange rate risk","['Svensson, Lars E. O.']","In a previous paper, ""Trade in Risky Assets,"" I have analyzed the pattern of international trade in risky real assets between barter economies, relying on the Law of Comparative Advantage and using autarky asset price differences to predict the pattern of asset trade. In this paper the analysis is extended to international trade in nominal assets (assets with returns paid in currencies) between monetary economies. The risk characteristics of real returns on nominal assets depend on price level and exchange rate risk, and therefore on monetary policy. It is examined how different combinations of monetary policies and exchange rate regimes affect nominal assets' return risk characteristics, their autarky prices, and hence their trade pattern, when countries differ with respect to their outputs or their attitudes towards risk. When world asset markets are incomplete, different monetary policies and exchange rate regimes have dramatic effects on risk characteristics of home and foreign currency bonds and on the trade pattern in these assets, as well as on aggregate capital and current accounts.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Svensson, Lars E.

Journal of International Economics,A model of exchange rate pass-through,"['Fisher, Eric']","Exchange rate pass-through is the phenomenon whereby changes in the value of foreign exchange are reflected in changes in import prices. This paper presents a model in which firms are price setters who anticipate exchange rate changes. In equilibrium, firms' strategies incorporate expectations about the exchange rate consistently and are best responses to the strategies of all others in the world market. It is shown that exchange rate changes give rise to import price changes, but the degree of exchange rate pass-through depends upon domestic and foreign market structures and the exchange rate regime. In general, exchange rate pass-through is higher if the home market is monopolistic or if the foreign market is competitive. The paper concludes with an examination of disaggregated Japanese manufacturing price indices, and it shows that the degree of exchange rate pass-through was indeed correlated with industry concentration during the most recent period of the yen's depreciation against the dollar.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Fisher, Eric, 1989.

Journal of International Economics,International policy coordination in interdependent monetary economies,"['van der Ploeg, Frederick']","A classical equilibrium model is analysed of two interdependent monetary economies in which it is assumed that cash is the only asset, and which is characterized by perfect foresight, flexible exchange rates and imperfect substitution between home and foreign goods. The first-best optimum sets the marginal rate of substitution between private and public goods to unity and leads to no tax distortions and the optimal quantity of money. Both non-cooperative and cooperative market-oriented outcomes are time-inconsistent, since each government has an incentive to renege and levy a surprise inflation tax. International policy coordination without precommitment can be counterproductive even though there are no tax distortions and the provision of public goods is optimal, since it exacerbates the credibility problems perceived by the private sectors and therefore leads to excessive inflation and too low a level of real money balances. The reason is that a unilateral surprise inflation tax induces a real depreciation and leads to inflation costs, but a multilateral expansion of monetary growth does not. The typical ranking in order of decreasing welfare is first-best optimum, cooperation with precommitment, competition with precommitment, competition without precommitment and coordination without precommitment.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","van der Ploeg, Frederick, 1988.

Journal of International Economics,Capital subsidies and countervailing duties in oligopolistic industries,"['Spencer, Barbara J.']","Under GATT, countries are allowed to impose countervailing duties to offset foreign subsidies. However GATT rules limit the amount of duty to the amount of the subsidy. This paper examines a generalized model of imperfect competition with capital subsidies and shows the conditions under which a countervailing duty will offset the effect of the subsidy on exports.

Journal of International Economics,"Credibility, real interest rates, and the optimal speed of trade liberalization","['Froot, Kenneth A.']","This paper investigates the effects of imperfectly credible trade liberalization programs on welfare and the allocation of real resources. We present a rational expectations model in which a government, with limited access to international financial markets may be forced to abort a liberalization program if hard-currency reserves are depleted too quickly. The liberalization's lack of perfect credibility arts as a distortion which becomes (rationally) intensified under the typical first-best policy of a direct move to free trade. A gradual lowering of trade barriers turns out to he welfare-superior to an immediate liberalization, and to improve the chance that. the program will ultimately succeed. We then derive the optimal speed of liberalization, the intertemporal allocation of resources, and the liberalization program's credibility.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Froot, Kenneth A., 1988.

Journal of International Economics,The gains from fiscal cooperation in the two-commodity real trade model,"['Turnovsky, Stephen J.']","This paper analyzes the gains from fiscal cooperation within the context of the standard two commodity real trade model. It shows how the adjustment in terms of trade is the critical factor in determining the effects of moving from a noncooperative equilibrium. In general, a noncooperative equilibrium leads to an overexpansion of government expenditure on the export good and an underexpansion on the import good, relative to a cooperative equilibrium. The specific example of a logarithmic economy is also considered. The paper discusses further the welfare effects resulting from the formation of a coalition among two countries.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Turnovsky, Stephen J., 1988.

Journal of International Economics,Trade policy with increasing returns and imperfect competition : Contradictory results from competing assumptions,"['Markusen, James R.', 'Venables, Anthony J.']","A number of recent papers reach different conclusions concerning the effects of trade and industrial policy on imperfectly competitive industries; the implications for policy are therefore sensitive to assumptions concerning both firm behaviour and market structure. This paper sets out a single model within which policy can be examined under a variety of assumptions concerning market structures. The results obtained from this model can be compared to results already obtained in the literature, and the model allows further analysis of some interesting cases. We consider the four types of market structure generated by oligopoly versus free entry, and segmented markets versus integrated markets. By employing simple functional forms we are able to make direct comparisons between these cases. We conclude that the effects of trade and industrial policies are greater when markets are segmented than when they are integrated, and that, if transport costs are small, policy is more potent when the number of firms is fixed than when there is free entry.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Markusen, James R. & Venables, Anthony J., 1988.

Journal of International Economics,Sectorial wages and the real exchange rate,"['Aizenman, Joshua', 'Frenkel, Jacob A.']","Consider a multi-sector economy subject to an exogenous demand shock that alters the equilibrium structure of relative prices. How should the structure of sectorial wages adjust in response to such a shock? This question is addressed in the context of a multi-sector model of an open-economy producing internationally tradable and non-tradable goods. In order to focus on intersectorial wage structure without abandoning the competitive neoclassical paradigm we assume that workers differ from each other in their absolute and relative skills. Such differences result in equilibrium wage differentials which are affected by the exogenous real shock. Cost of negotiations result in labor market contracts which set nominal wages in advance of the realization of the stochastic shocks. The analysis provides formulae for the optimal sectorial wage-indexation rules. The optimal rules alter both the absolute and the relative structure of sectorial nominal wages. We examine the dependence of the optimal wage adjustments on the degree of heterogeneity of the skill distribution and on the degree to which the economy is open to international trade; we also study the effects of various shocks and policies on the real exchange rate, real wages and the distribution of income.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Aizenman, Joshua & Frenkel, Jacob A., 1988.

Using relationships between autarky factor prices and factor endowments, several relationships are derived between factor prices with trade and its factor content. The most general result is a positive correlation between relative changes in the factor content of trade, appropriately normalized, and proportional changes in factor prices.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Deardorff, Alan V. & Staiger, Robert W., 1988.

Journal of International Economics,Borrowing to defend the exchange rate and the timing and magnitude of speculative attacks,"['Buiter, Willem H.']","The paper extends the recent literature on the collapse of managed exchange-rate regimes by allowing explicitly for the government budget constraint and the interest cost of servicing the public debt. The policy experiment analysed in this paper is the decision by a government to replenish its stock of foreign exchange reserves through a once-off open market sale of bonds. Without a fundamental fiscal correction (i.e. a decision to reduce the primary (non-interest) deficit by an amount equal to the increase in the interest cost of servicing the debt) the consequences of this policy are as follows: in a deterministic model, the timing of the speculative attack is brought forward (delayed) if the borrowing takes place long before (close to) the date at which without borrowing the collapse would have occurred. The magnitude of the attack (the final loss of reserves) always increases because of borrowing. In a stochastic model, borrowing reduces the probability of an early collapse and increases the likelihood of a later collapse. Under mild conditions, the expected length of the time interval until the collapse occurs is increased by borrowing.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Buiter, Willem H., 1987.

Journal of International Economics,"Asset markets, tariffs, and political risk","['Stockman, Alan C.', 'Dellas, Harris']","The paper examines a simple model in which exogenous political risk creates uncertainty about tariffs. The model predicts a relation between consumption and tariffs that differs radically from that implied by models without asset markets or political risk. Given the probability distribution of tariffs, domestic consumption and utility (ex post) are lower in states of the world with a domestic tariff and no foreign tariff than with a foreign tariff and no domestic tariff.This conclusion emerges despite the fact that the opposite would be obtained in the absence of asset markets. So economists should not be surprised if observed relations between consumption and tariffs differ from the predictions of static theory in either time-series or cross-sections.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Stockman, Alan C. & Dellas, Harris, 1986.

Journal of International Economics,Real aspects of exchange rate regime choice with collapsing fixed rates,"['Flood, Robert P.', 'Hodrick, Robert J.']","Typical evaluations of the choice of exchange rate regime employ a criterion function that depends on the real performance of the economy, and they focus on regimes that are expected to last indefinitely. This latter feature is strongly contradicted by the transitory nature of actual regimes.This paper extends the recent literature on collapses of fixed exchange rate regimes with exogenous real sectors to examine how the predictions of two popular models for the determination of some real economic variables must be modified when agents rationally perceive that the fixed rate regime will be transitory. The models studied are simple stochastic versions of the models in Dornbusch (1976) and Flood and Marion (1982).(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Flood, Robert P. & Hodrick, Robert J., 1986.

Journal of International Economics,Targeted export promotion with several oligopolistic industries,"['Dixit, Avinash K.', 'Grossman, Gene M.']","In this paper we ask whether a policy of targeted export promotion can raise domestic welfare when several oligopolistic industries all draw on the same scarce factor of production. Our point of departure is one of Cournot duopoly in which a single home firm competes with a single foreign firm in a market outside the horse country. It has been shown previously that when there is only one such industry in an otherwise perfectly competitive world economy, a subsidy policy by the home government transfers profits to the domestic firm, and thereby raises domestic welfare. However,when many such industries (and only these) utilize the same inelastically supplied resource, promotion of one bids up the return to the specific factor, and consequently disadvantages all of the non-targeted industries in their respective duopolistic competitions. Our question then is which industry(s), if any, is worthy of promotion. We find that, when the specific factor is used in fixed proportion to output, and all of the duopolies have similar demand and cost conditions, a policy of free trade is optimal. We identify the conditions for welfare improvement when a single industry is selected for targeting under asymmetric conditions, and also investigate whether a uniform subsidy to all industries in the imperfectly competitive sector will raise domestic welfare.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Dixit, Avinash K. & Grossman, Gene M., 1986.

We show that (i) there are, in general, a multiplicity of such equilibria, and (ii) under certain restrictions, the Cournot equilibrium, which is based on the assumption of no retaliation can also be a CCV equilibrium. By contrast, free trade is never a CCV equilibrium.

Journal of International Economics,Imports as a cause of injury: The case of the U.S. steel industry,"['Grossman, Gene M.']","Recently, the United States International Trade Commission conducted a Section 201 or ""escape clause"" hearing to determine whether imports have been the most significant cause of injury to the U.S. steel industry. This paper suggests a methodology for conducting the necessary analysis for such determinations, and applies it to the case of the steel industry. First, a reduced-form equation for steel industry employment is derived and estimated. The equation specifies industry employment as a function of the price of imported steel, the price of energy, the price of iron ore, a time trend, real income and (in one variant) the wage rate in the steel industry. The estimated coefficients are used to perform counter factual simulations, which allow us to attribute changes in industry employment to their proximate causes. The analysis reveals that for the period from 1976 to 1983, a secular shift away from employment in the steel industry has been the most important cause of injury. For the shorter period from 1979 to 1983, secular shift and import competition are roughly equal in importance, with the latter being entirely the result of the substantial appreciation of the U.S. dollar during this period.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Grossman, Gene M., 1986.

It focuses on the adjustment of the short-term and long-term interest rates and the divergence of their transitional paths, particularly in anticipation of these disturbances. The analysis demonstrates how anticipation of a future policy change can generate perverse short-run behavior. The essential reason for the divergence between the short and long rates is that the latter is dominated by long-term expectations, while the former is primarily determined by current influences.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Turnovsky, Stephen J., 1986.

Journal of International Economics,"Capital controls, the dual exchange rate, and devaluation","['Obstfeld, Maurice']","This paper re-examines the effect of devaluation under capital-account restrictions, adding to traditional formulations the seemingly minor (but realistic) assumption that central-bank reserves earn interest. The extra assumption has important implications. In an intertemporal model, devaluation is no longer neutral in the long run as it is in the literature on the monetary approach to the balance of payments. Further, the economy may possess multiple stationary states, some of them unstable.The analysis confirms, however, that even large devaluations must improve the balance of payments if the economy is initially at a stable stationary position. A by-product of the analysis is a pricing formula for the financial exchange rate in a dual exchange rate system. That formula is consistent with recent consumption-based models of asset pricing.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Obstfeld, Maurice, 1986.

Conditions for factor price equalization are derived for situations with tradein both goods and factors,as well as Rybczynski and Stolper-Sarnuel Sofl theorems. A weak price versionof the Heckscher-Ohlifl theorem is presented, as well as stronger quantity versions.The basic theorems of international trade, suitably interpreted,are shown to hold in their strong versions ifthe number of international markets is at least as large as the number of factors.The crucial dimensionality issue is hence not the relative number of goods and factors per se, but the number of international markets relative to the number of factors.

Journal of International Economics,Firless firwoes: How preferences can interfere with the theorems of international trade,"['Deardorff, Alan V.']","An example is presented of a two-country, two-factor, four-good trade model in which free trade causes factor prices to be drawn farther apart than they were in autarky. The example is equivalent to a two-good model with a double factor intensity reversal (FIR), and thus demonstrates that the problems associated with FIRs can arise in many dimensions without them. These problems include the undermining of other trade theorems as well, and can be avoided only by making some assumption about demand as well as about technology. For example, the model becomes well-behaved if preferences and technology are both Cobb-Douglas.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Deardorff, Alan V., 1986.

Journal of International Economics,Tariff liberalization policy and financial restrictions,"['Aizenman, Joshua']",The purpose of this paper is to assess how restrictions on capital mobility affect adjustment to a tariff liberalization policy. This is done by comparing the adlustment process under free and restricted convertibility of foreign assets in a regime where the commercial exchange rate is pegged. It is shown that trade liberalization causes in the short run a larger drop in domestic goods prices and a smaller current account deficit in a regime with restricted convertibility. Similar results apply also for the long-run current account effects of the liberalization: they are smaller under financial restrictions.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.),"Aizenman, Joshua, 1985.

It focuses on the intergenerational welfare redistributions caused by an increase in the public debt triggered by a period of government budget deficit, and shows that these effects are markedly different in open and closed economies. The interplay between the deficits in the government budget and the current account is also analyzed. Here, it is shown how a single period with a deficit in the government budget can be followed by a seciuence of periods with a deficit in the current account.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Persson, Torsten, 1985.

Journal of International Economics,Money and the terms of trade,"['Rotemberg, Julio J.']","This paper examines the connection between money and the terms of trade in the context of a simple monetary equilibrium model with flexible prices. Money is held for transactions purposes. Because carrying out financial transactions is costly, households visit their financial intermediaries only occasionally. An important feature of the model is that different households visit the financial intermediaries at different times. This is sufficient to ensure that even though the model features perfect foresight and competitive markets, monetary policies affect output under both fixed and flexible exchange rates. Moreover, in the latter regime expansionary monetary policies tend to worsen the terms of trade while this is not the case under fixed exchange rates.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Rotemberg, Julio J., 1985.

Monetary policy which accommodates prices and/or interest rates is shown to increase the likelihood of undershooting. Using constrained maximum likelihood methods,the model is estimated for Germany and Japan since the advent of generalized floating in 1973. Based on the estimated parameter values, the mark exhibits overshooting while the yen is characterized by undershooting. The constraints implied by the model cannot (by likelihood ratio tests) be rejected at standard significance levels for either country.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Papell, David H., 1985.

In such a world export subsidies can appear as attractive policy tools, from a national point of view, because they improve the relative position of a domestic firm in noncooperative rivalries with foreign firms, enabling it to expand its market share and earn greater profits. In effect, subsidies change the initial conditions of the game that firms play. The terms of trade move against the subsidizing country, but its welfare can increase because, under imperfect competition, price exceeds the marginal cost of exports. International noncooperative equilibriumis characterized by such subsidies on the part of exporting nations, even though they are jointly suboptimal.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Brander, James A. & Spencer, Barbara J., 1985.

Journal of International Economics,Intergenerational and international trade,"['Dornbusch, Rudiger']","The paper sets out an overlapping generations model in an open economy context. In the absence of productive capital a real consol is the vehicle for intertemporal consumption smoothing. The presence of a long term asset implies that the anticipated future path of the economy, through the term structure of interest, affects current generations. The model is applied to issues in the closed and open economy.

Journal of International Economics,Separability and the specification of foreign trade functions,"['Winters, L. Alan']","A universal assumption of models allocating a country's imports among suppliers is that demand is separable over foreign and domestic sources. Nearly as common are the assumptions that import demands are homothetic and mutually separable. This paper explores the theoretical implications of these assumptions and then tests them, applying Deaton and Muellbauer's ‘Almost Ideal Demand System’ to U.K. data on manufactures covering 1952–79. It uses Lagrange Multiplier tests. Both homogeneity and separability are overwhelmingly rejected. A model of import demand without these restrictions is introduced which, while not entirely satisfactory, suggests a direction for future research.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Winters, L.

Journal of International Economics,A re-examination of purchasing power parity : A multi-country and multi-period study,"['Hakkio, Craig S.']","This paper presents a systematic analysis of the purchasing power parity hypothesis (PPP). This hypothesis states that the exchange rate is equal to the ratio of the domestic price level to the foreign price level. It has recently been argued that PPP performs poorly in the 1970s. This paper examines several possible explanations for this poor performance . We examine PPF in the 1920s and the 1970s, using monthly and quarterly data, to see if the relationship has changed over time. We also examine PPP in a multi-exchange rate world, allowing a quite general error process so as to allow deviations from PPP to be autocorrelated and correlated across currencies. We are then able to examine the degree to which the world has become more interdependent. We also provide evidence that deviations from PPP may follow a random walk. Finally, the role of the U.S. dollar as base currency is examined. We find, in general, that PPP holds quite well as a long run proposition, but the deviations from PPP tend to persist.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Hakkio, Craig S., 1984.

Journal of International Economics,Exchange market intervention under alternative forms of exogenous disturbances,"['Turnovsky, Stephen J.']","This paper analyzes exchange market intervention in a stochastic model of a small open economy. The distinction is made between disturbances which are unanticipated and anticipated on the one hand, and those that are perceived as being transitory or permanent, on the other. The paper demonstrates how the appropriate form of exchange market intervention is sensitive to these aspects of the disturbances. Of particular interest is the case of an unanticipated permanent disturbance, when output may be stabilized perfectly about its frictionless level by the use of a very simple class of intervention rules.The optimal rules in other cases are also discussed.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Turnovsky, Stephen J., 1984.

We use maximum likelihood estimation to impose a constraint between the coefficients and the error variance-covariance matrix. For a portfolio of six currencies, we are able statistically to reject the constraint. Evidently investors are either not sophisticated enough to maximize a function of the mean and variance of end-of-period wealth, or else are too sophisticated to do so.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Frankel, Jeffrey & Engel, Charles M., 1984.

Journal of International Economics,"Multinationals, multi-plant economies, and the gains from trade","['Markusen, James R.']","A general equilibrium model of a multinational enterprise based on economies of multi-plant operation is developed. These economies are modelled as arising from the existence of a joint input whose productivity in each production facility is independent of the number of facilities maintained by a firm. The multinational thus offers the world increased technical efficiency by eliminating the duplication of the joint input that would occur with independent national firms. Since this technical efficiency may come at the expense of increased market power, the full determinants of home country, host country, and world welfare are considered.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Markusen, James R., 1984.

If ad valorem tariffs or subsidies are considered, a subsidy is optimal if the elasticity of demand increases as consumption increases.The critical conditions in both ad valorern and specific cases hold generally for Cournot ologopoly.

Journal of International Economics,A 'reciprocal dumping' model of international trade,"['Brander, James', 'Krugman, Paul']","This paper develops a model where rivalry of oligopolistic firms serves as an independent cause of international trade. The model shows how such rivalry naturally gives rise to ""dumping"" of output in foreign markets, and show such dumping can be reciprocal -- there may be two-way trade in the same product. Reciprocal dumping is possible for fairly general specifications of firm behaviour. The welfare effects of this seemingly pointless trade are ambiguous: resources are wasted, but increased competition reduces monopoly distortions. Surprisingly, with free entry and Cournot behaviour, reciprocal dumping is unambiguously beneficial.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Brander, James & Krugman, Paul, 1983.

The models share the common characteristic that the basis for trade is something other than differences in relative factor endowments. These alternative bases for trade include returns to scale, imperfect competition, production and factor taxes, and differences in production technology. Taken together, the models suggest a more general idea: the widely held notion that trade in goods and factors are substitutes is in fact a rather special result which is a general characteristic only of factor proportions models.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Markusen, James R., 1983.

Journal of International Economics,Aspects of the optimal management of exchange rates,"['Frenkel, Jacob A.', 'Aizenman, Joshua']","This paper analyzes aspects of the economics of the optimal management of exchange rates. It shows that the choice of the optimal exchange rate regime depends on the nature and the origin of the stochastic shocks that affect the economy. Generally, the higher is the variance of real shocks which affect the supply of goods, the larger becomes the desirability of fixity of exchange rates. The rationale for that implication is that the balance of payments serves as a shock absorber which mitigates the effect of real shocks on consumption. The importance of this factor diminishes the larger is the economy's access to world capital markets. On the other hand, the desirability of exchange rate flexibility increases the larger are the variances of the shocks to the demand for money, to the supply of money, to foreign prices and to purchasing power parities. All of these shocks exert a similar effect and their sum is referred to as the ""effective monetary shock."" It is also shown that the desirability of exchange rate flexibility increases the larger is the propensity to save out of transitory income. When the analysis is extended to an economy which produces traded and non-traded goods it is shown that the desirability of exchange rate flexibility diminishes the higher is the share of non-traded goods relative to traded goods and the lower are the elasticities of demand and supply of the two goods.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Frenkel, Jacob A. & Aizenman, Joshua, 1982.

Journal of International Economics,The location of overseas production and production for export by U.S. multinational firms,"['Kravis, Irving B.', 'Lipsey, Robert E.']","The location of overseas manufacturing production by U.S. firms seems to have been strongly influenced by common factors that operate in all industries: notably proximity to the United States and to other markets. Within industries, the choices made by parent firms among locations appear to show a tendency of ""opposites attract,"" with low-wage and low-capital-intensity parents choosing high-wage, high-capital intensity countries and high-wage, high-capital-intensity parents making the opposite choice. Production for export seems to have been most strongly attracted by large internal markets in host countries. Economies of scale in production presumably made large markets also economical as export bases. Another factor was high trade propensities of host countries, which we interpret as representing access to imported materials at low world prices or better transport, finance, and other trade facilities. Labor cost seems to have been a weak influence on location choices. U.S. firms tended to export from high-wage countries but the high productivity in such countries more than offset the high wages. However, labor cost, to the extent we could measure it, was not in general a major influence on the location of export production.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Kravis, Irving B. & Lipsey, Robert E., 1982.

When countries differ in size, trade will always increase total world real income, but the large country may experience a welfare loss. Increasing returns to scale in the production of the monopolized good complicates the situation further, but it generally remains true that trade increases world real income.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Markusen, James R., 1981.

Journal of International Economics,"Intermediate imports, the terms of trade, and the dynamics of the exchange rate and current account","['Obstfeld, Maurice']","This paper studies the macroeconomic effects of an increase in the price of an imported intermediate production input. The framework of the analysis is a small open economy with abating exchange rate and endogenous terms if trade, in which saving depends on residents'(variable) rate of time preference. Contrary to popular conceptions, an intermediate price shock may lead to an appreciation of the exchange rate in both the short run and the long run, and is likely to occasion a current-account surplus. The terms of trade between foreign and domestic finished goods always improve in the long run.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Obstfeld, Maurice, 1980.

Journal of International Economics,Imperfect asset substitutability and monetary policy under fixed exchange rates,"['Obstfeld, Maurice']","This paper presents a long-run model of the open economy in a world of fixed exchange rates and imperfect substitutability between bonds denominated in different currencies. The model explicitly accounts for the wealth flow accompanying current-account imbalance and for the flow of interest payments associated with international lending. Both the dynamic and steady-state implications of the model are quite different from those of models that specify the capital account as a continuing flow responding to the level of interest rates. In particular, we find that when there exists outside government debt, open-market policy is not in general neutral in the long run. We also find conditions under which the central bank is able to hold the domestic price level constant in the face of an inflationary disturbance from abroad without exhausting, in the long run, its stock of domestic assets.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Obstfeld, Maurice, 1980.

Journal of International Economics,"Exchange rates, money, and relative prices: The dollar-pound in the 1920s","['Clements, Kenneth W.', 'Frenkel, Jacob A.']",This paper applies the analytical framework of the monetary approach to exchange rate determination to the analysis of the Dollar/Pound exchange rate during the first part of the 1920's. The analysis uses monthly data up to the return of Britain to gold in 1925. The equilibrium exchange rate is shown to be influenced by both real and monetary factors which operate through their influence on the relative demands and supplies of monies. Special attention is given to examination of the relationship between exchange rates and the relative price of traded to non-traded goods. In the empirical work the prices of traded goods are proxied by the wholesale price indices and the prices of non-traded are proxied by wages. One of the key findings of the paper is the estimate of the elasticity of the exchange rate with respect to the relative price of traded to non-traded goods. This elasticity is estimated with high precision and is shown to be .415 which provides an independent measure of the relative share of spending on non-traded goods. This estimate is consistent with other estimates obtained in studies of expenditure shares. The paper concluded with a dynamic simulation which indicates the satisfactory quality of the predictive ability of the model.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.),"Clements, Kenneth W. & Frenkel, Jacob A., 1980.

Journal of International Economics,Weak links in the chain of comparative advantage,"['Deardorff, Alan V.']","This paper examines the proposition that trade in many commodities can be explained by a chain of comparative advantage. It is first shown, in a two-country, two-factor model, that trade accords with the ranking of goods by factor intensity if there are unequal factor prices, free trade, and only final goods. This result continues to hold if either trade impediments or intermediate products are introduced. However, if both are present, the chain proposition breaks down. Finally, with many countries, it is shown that trade impediments alone can invalidate the chain proposition.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Deardorff, Alan V., 1979.

Journal of International Economics,Price behavior in the light of balance of payments theories,"['Kravis, Irving B.', 'Lipsey, Robert E.']","The purpose of this paper is to describe the behavior of that subset of prices and price indexes that is relevant to the theory of balance of payments adjustment. The theoretical writings on the balance of payments may be viewed at this juncture as falling into two main groups -- the ""standard"" theories and the more recent monetary theories. Each of these is examined to determine the assumptions and predictions made about particular kinds of prices, and the empirical evidence regarding these prices is then set out. Although some assessment of the theories -- solely from the price aspect -- is offered, the emphasis is on the price structure and price behavior that ought to be captured in a satisfactory theory of the mechanisms of international adjustment. For pragmatic reasons, attention is placed mainly on the theory relating to exchange rate changes rather than on the explanation of adjustment with fixed exchange rates.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Kravis, Irving B. & Lipsey, Robert E., 1978.

Journal of International Economics,Tariff concessions in the Kennedy Round and the structure of protection in West Germany : An econometric assessment,"['Riedel, James']","It is well documented that the structure of tariffs in industrialized countries affords the greatest protection to relatively (unskilled) labor-intensive branches of industry (Constantopoulos3 1974 and references therein). Since we know from the Stolper-Samuelson theorem that this implies an improvement in the relative reward for services of labor, in particular unskilled labo, the political motive for such a tariff policy is obvious. In recent years industrialized countries have loudly proclaimed their dedication to the principles of free-trade and their intent to counterbalance the disadvantageous trade position of the less developed countries. While progress on the latter objective has been modest (Murry, 1973), great gains have been achieved in lowering tariff barriers. The most significant advances in this regard were effected in the GATT Kennedy Round (1963-67), which produced an average 35 percent reduction in tariff levels of non-agricultural products by far and away exceeding any reductions negotiated in previous GATT rounds. An interesting question in light of industrialized countries practised, as well as proclaimed dedication to trade liberalization is whether their tariff policy continues to be designed with labor's short-run interests in mind.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Riedel, James, 1977.

Necessary conditions which must characterize an optimal tax structure from the point of view of one country are solved for and interpreted. Second, the model serves as a vehicle to extend the theory of corrective taxation in the case where only one policy instrument is available to deal with several distortions simultaneously. It is pointed out that the ranking of alternate second best tax structures typically depends upon which good is imported and which good is exported.(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)","Markusen, James R., 1975.
