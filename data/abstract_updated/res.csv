Our analysis highlights a novel form of selective return migration where those who plan to stay longer invest more into skill acquisition, with important implications for the assessment of immigrants’ career paths and the estimation of their earnings profiles. Our study also explains the willingness of immigrants to accept jobs at wages that seem unacceptable to natives. Finally, our model provides important insight for the design of migration policies, showing that policies that initially restrict residence or condition residence on achievement shape not only immigrants’ career profiles through their impact on human capital investment but also determine the selection of arrivals and leavers.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a89_3ay_3a2022_3ai_3a6_3ap_3a2841-2871..htm,10.1093/restud/rdac003

We study the rollout of these emissions-cheating diesel cars across the United States from 2008 to 2015 as a natural experiment to examine the impact of moderate levels of car pollution on infant and child health in the general population. Using the universe of vehicle registrations, we find that an additional cheating diesel car per 1,000 cars increases , , and ozone by 2, 2.2, and 1.3, respectively, while the low birth weight rate and infant mortality rate increase by 1.9 and 1.7, respectively.

We develop a quantitative general equilibrium spatial framework featuring endogenous transportation costs and traffic congestion and apply it to evaluate the welfare impact of transportation infrastructure improvements. Our approach yields analytical expressions for transportation costs between any two locations, the traffic along each link of the transportation network, and the equilibrium distribution of economic activity across the economy, each as a function of the underlying quality of infrastructure and the strength of traffic congestion. We characterize the properties of such an equilibrium and show how the framework can be combined with traffic data to evaluate the impact of improving any segment of the infrastructure network. Applying our framework to both the US highway network and the Seattle road network, we find highly variable returns to investment across different links in the respective transportation networks, highlighting the importance of well-targeted infrastructure investment.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a89_3ay_3a2022_3ai_3a6_3ap_3a2911-2957..htm,10.1093/restud/rdac001

To do so, we measure beliefs about the effects of macroeconomic shocks on unemployment and inflation, providing respondents with identical information about the parameters of the shocks and previous realizations of macroeconomic variables. Within samples of 6,500 US households and 1,500 experts, beliefs are widely dispersed, even about the directional effects of shocks, and there are large differences in average beliefs between households and experts. Part of this disagreement seems to arise because respondents think of different propagation channels of the shocks, in particular demand- vs. supply-side mechanisms. We provide evidence on the role of associative memory in driving heterogeneity in thoughts and forecasts: contextual cues and prior experiences shape which propagation channels individuals retrieve and thereby which forecasts they make. Our findings offer a new perspective on the widely documented disagreement in macroeconomic expectations.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a89_3ay_3a2022_3ai_3a6_3ap_3a2958-2991..htm,10.1093/restud/rdac008

Exploiting information from a unique panel containing billions of transactions in the US consumer goods sector, we show that our empirical findings are consistent with a narrative in which firms face demand uncertainty and learn through prices. Such a mechanism of active learning from prices can strongly influence an economy’s aggregate price level and can thus be important for assessing the degree of monetary non-neutrality. To quantify this, we build a general equilibrium menu cost model with active learning and exogenous entry that features heterogeneity in pricing moments over the life cycle of products. Under this setup, firms engage in active learning to deal with uncertainty on their demand curves. Firms choose prices not only to maximize static profits but also to create signals to obtain valuable information on their demand. In the calibrated version of our model, the cumulative real effects of a nominal shock are approximately three times as large compared to a standard price-setting model. The main intuition behind this result is that active learning weakens the selection effect. Price changes are mainly determined by forces of active learning and, hence, become more orthogonal to aggregate shocks, which reduces the aggregate price flexibility of the economy.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a89_3ay_3a2022_3ai_3a6_3ap_3a2992-3054..htm,10.1093/restud/rdac004

Estimates from our preferred specification show that the number of offered seats is 2 lower when all legacy airlines in a market discuss the concept of “capacity discipline.” We verify that this reduction materializes only when legacy airlines communicate concurrently, and that it cannot be explained by other possibilities, including that airlines are simply announcing to investors their unilateral plans to reduce capacity, and then following through on those announcements.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a89_3ay_3a2022_3ai_3a6_3ap_3a3055-3084..htm,10.1093/restud/rdab100

This equivalence applies to random utility models that are not necessarily additive, smooth, nor even invertible. Based on this equivalence, algorithms for the determination of stable matchings provide effective computational methods for estimating these models. For non-invertible models, the identified set of utility vectors is a lattice, and the matching algorithms recover sharp upper and lower bounds on the utilities. Our matching approach facilitates estimation of models that were previously difficult to estimate, such as the pure characteristics model.

We develop a theoretical framework to rationalize the approaches of both China and the West to managing the financial system as being optimal given the differences in their respective economies. In this framework, a government leans against trading of noise traders but at the expense of introducing policy noise to the market. Our welfare analysis shows that under certain underlying economic conditions, the optimal government policy induces a government-centric equilibrium, in which government intervention is so intensive that all investors choose to acquire private information about policy noise rather than fundamentals. This policy regime characterizes China’s approach with financial stability prioritized over other policy objectives.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a89_3ay_3a2022_3ai_3a6_3ap_3a3115-3153..htm,10.1093/restud/rdab098

To address this question, we study a model in which banks make costly decisions to participate in an OTC market, a centralized market, or both markets at the same time. Banks differ in their ability to take large positions, what we call their trading capacity. In equilibrium, intermediate-capacity banks find it optimal to participate in the centralized market. In contrast, low- and high-capacity banks find it optimal to participate in the OTC market, due to an endogenous complementarity. Namely, low-capacity banks receive worse terms of trade than in the centralized market but better risk sharing, thanks to the intermediation services offered by high-capacity banks. High-capacity banks receive worse risk sharing than in the centralized market, but profit from the provision of intermediation services to low-capacity banks. While the social optimum has qualitatively similar participation patterns, it prescribes that more customers migrate to the centralized market, and that more dealers enter the OTC market.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a89_3ay_3a2022_3ai_3a6_3ap_3a3223-3266..htm,10.1093/restud/rdac010

We propose alternative tariff and subsidy designs for policymakers to incentivize solar panel adoptions and guarantee that network costs are recovered, while trading off efficiency, equity, and welfare motives. We estimate a structural model of energy demand and solar panel adoption, using a unique matched dataset on energy consumption, prices, income, wealth, solar panel installations, and building characteristics for 165,000 households in Switzerland from 2008 to 2014. Our counterfactuals recommend the optimal solar panel installation cost subsidies and two-part energy tariffs to achieve a solar energy target. We show that, relative to installation cost subsidies, relying on marginal prices to incentivize solar panel adoptions is more cost efficient and progressive across the income distribution, but generates a larger aggregate welfare loss.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a89_3ay_3a2022_3ai_3a6_3ap_3a3267-3302..htm,10.1093/restud/rdac005

Focusing on the case of severe storms in the US, I develop a macro heterogeneous-agent model to quantify the interactions between adaptation, federal disaster policy, and climate change. The model departs from the standard climate damage function and incorporates the damage from storms as the realization of idiosyncratic shocks. Using the calibrated model, I infer that adaptation capital comprises approximately 1 of the US capital stock. I find that while the moral hazard effects from disaster aid reduce adaptation in the US economy, federal subsidies for investment in adaptation more than correct for the moral hazard. I introduce climate change into the model as a permanent increase in either or both the severity or probability of storms. Adaptation reduces the damage from this climate change by approximately one-third. Finally, I show that modelling the idiosyncratic risk component of climate damage has quantitatively important implications for adaptation and for the welfare cost of climate change.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a89_3ay_3a2022_3ai_3a6_3ap_3a3303-3344..htm,10.1093/restud/rdab099

This article conceptualizes a view of unfair inequality and introduces a new measure of inequality based on two widely held fairness principles: equality of opportunity and freedom from poverty. It develops a method for decomposing inequality and its trends into an unfair and a fair component. We provide two empirical applications of our measure. First, we analyse the development of inequality in the US from 1969 to 2014 from a fairness perspective. Second, we conduct a corresponding international comparison between the US and 31 European countries in 2010. Our results document that unfair inequality matches the well-documented inequality growth in the US since 1980. This trend is driven by decreases in social mobility, i.e., increasing importance of parental education and occupation for the income of their children.

High-earning women in leadership positions and women who need to acquire new human capital are central because their new employment would require particularly high investments that are incompatible with having a newborn in the short time remaining on the biological clock.

Yet, inflation has typically undershot, not overshot, central bank targets over the past couple decades. The low, while generally positive, inflation rate has (more arguably) been associated with low output and low growth. In this article, I consider these observations through the lens of a class of representative agent rational expectations models with nominal (price-setting) frictions and the possibility of firm entry/exit. I show that for any level of nominal frictions (no matter how small) and for any monetary policy rule that satisfies a set of weak restrictions, there is a large set of equilibria that exhibit permanently low inflation, low output, and low nominal interest rates. These equilibria can only exhibit positive long-run inflation if growth is low and the specification of nominal frictions (i.e. the Phillips curve) takes an unconventional but nonetheless empirically plausible form.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a89_3ay_3a2022_3ai_3a6_3ap_3a3410-3435..htm,10.1093/restud/rdac009

Based on experimental evidence, we demonstrate that incentives systematically influence individuals’ allocation of cognitive resources, and their propensity to actively engage with a decision or to stay passive. Policies that steer individuals’ attention to a specific decision lead to more active decision-making and better choices in the targeted choice domain, but induce negative cognitive spillovers on the quality of choices in other domains. In our setting, these two countervailing effects offset each other, such that the overall payoff consequences of the interventions are essentially zero. We further document that cognitive spillovers are especially pronounced for complex choices and for subgroups of the population with a smaller stock of cognitive resources.

We answer this question in the context of a reform which granted automatic birthright citizenship to eligible immigrant children born in Germany after 1 January 2000. Using survey data, we collected from students in 57 schools and comparing those born in the months before vs. after the reform, we find the introduction of birthright citizenship lowers measures of life satisfaction and self-esteem for immigrant girls by 0.32 and 0.25 standard deviations, respectively. This is especially true for Muslims, where parents are likely to prefer more traditional cultural outcomes than their daughters. Moreover, we find that Muslim girls granted birthright citizenship are less integrated into German society: they are both more socially isolated and less likely to self-identify as German. Exploring mechanisms for these unintended drops in well-being and assimilation, we find that immigrant Muslim parents invest less in their daughters’ schooling and that these daughters receive worse grades in school if they are born after the reform. Parents are also less likely to speak German with these daughters. Consistent with a rise in intra-family conflict, birthright citizenship results in disillusionment where immigrant Muslim girls believe their chances of achieving their educational goals are lower and the perceived odds of having to forgo a career for a family rise. In contrast, immigrant boys experience, if anything, an improvement in well-being, integration, and schooling outcomes. Taken together, the findings point towards immigrant girls being pushed by parents to conform to a role within traditional culture, whereas boys are allowed to take advantage of the opportunities that come with citizenship. To explain these findings, we construct a simple game-theoretic model which builds on Akerlof and Kranton (2000), where identity-concerned parents constrain their daughter’s choices, and hence lower their daughter’s well-being, when faced with the threat of integration. Alternative models can explain some of the findings in isolation.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a89_3ay_3a2022_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a2491-2528..htm,10.1093/restud/rdab089

The optimal currency choice depends on the price risk of each currency, as well as on the covariance of its price and the relative consumption needs of the agents signing the contract. When a larger share of contracts is denominated in local currency, the government can use inflation more effectively to either redistribute resources or reduce default costs, which makes local currency more attractive for private contracts. When governments lack commitment, competitive equilibria can be constrained inefficient, thus providing a reason to regulate the currency choice of private contracts. We show that both the equilibrium use of local currency and the implications for regulation depend on the level of domestic policy risk.

Our analysis is facilitated by the prevalence of leveraged funds that track the same underlying asset: by choosing between higher and lower leverage, investors trade off higher return against less risk. Our estimates indicate that investor expectations are heterogeneous, extrapolative, and persistent.

The CRA class is large and includes loss-averse, disappointment-averse, mean-dispersion, and Yaari’s dual preferences as well as coherent and convex risk measures. Any preference in this class displays first-order risk aversion, contrasting the standard expected utility case which displays second-order risk aversion. The optimal mechanism offers “ full-insurance” in the sense that each agent’s utility is independent of other agents’ reports.

We propose a jackknifed version of the classical weak identification-robust Anderson–Rubin (AR) test statistic. Large-sample inference based on the jackknifed AR is valid under heteroscedasticity and weak identification. The feasible version of this statistic uses a novel variance estimator. The test has uniformly correct size and good power properties. We also develop a pre-test for weak identification that is related to the size property of a Wald test based on the Jackknife Instrumental Variable Estimator.

Their information is reflected in a stochastic choice rule, specifying the probability of a signal leading to investment. If discontinuous stochastic choice rules are infinitely costly, there is a unique equilibrium as costs become small, in which actions are a best response to a uniform (Laplacian) belief over the proportion of others investing. Infeasibility of discontinuous stochastic choice rules captures the idea that it is impossible to perfectly distinguish states that are arbitrarily close together and is both empirically documented and satisfied by many natural micro-founded cost functionals on information.

These correlations hold across countries, sub-national regions, and individuals. Second, the magnitude of the patience elasticity strongly increases in the level of aggregation. To provide an interpretive lens for these patterns, we analyse an overlapping generations model in which savings and education decisions are endogenous to patience, aggregate production is characterized by capital-skill complementarities, and productivity implicitly depends on patience through a human capital externality.

Through them, a source central bank provides source-currency credit to recipient-country banks using the recipient central bank as the monitor and as the bearer of the credit risk. In theory, the swap lines should put a ceiling on deviations from covered interest parity, lower average ex post bank borrowing costs, and increase ex ante inflows from recipient-country banks into privately issued assets denominated in the source-country’s currency. Empirically, these three predictions are tested using variation in the terms of the swap line over time, variation in the central banks that have access to the swap line, variation in the days of the week in which the swap line is open, variation in the exposure of different securities to foreign investment, and variation in banks’ exposure to dollar funding risk.

Motivated by this fact, I provide a theory connecting the exchange rate regime to financial integration. The key feature of the model is that monetary policy affects the value of collateral that creditors seize upon default. Under flexible exchange rates, national governments can expropriate foreign creditors by depreciating the exchange rate, which induces investors to impose tight constraints on international borrowing. Creating a monetary union, by eliminating this source of currency risk, increases financial integration among member countries. This process, however, does not necessarily lead to higher welfare. The reason is that a high degree of capital mobility can generate multiple equilibria, with bad equilibria characterized by inefficient capital flights. Capital controls or fiscal transfers can eliminate bad equilibria, but their implementation requires international cooperation.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a89_3ay_3a2022_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a1911-1947..htm,10.1093/restud/rdab057

However, information about children is not used in pricing long-term care insurance which pays only for formal care. I start by providing descriptive evidence that private information about children’s informal care likelihood results in adverse selection: the market attracts a disproportionate number of individuals who face higher formal care utilization risk due to a lower probability of receiving care from their children. To quantify the welfare consequence of adverse selection, I develop and estimate a dynamic intergenerational model featuring long-term care insurance, savings, informal care provision, and employment choices. Based on the estimated equilibrium insurance market framework, I show that using information about children in pricing insurance contracts reduces adverse selection and results in the average welfare gain of $6,200 per family.

In our model, some inventions require the patent incentive while others do not, and asymmetric information creates a need for screening. We show that the endogeneity of challenges implies that courts, even if perfect, cannot solve the screening problem. Simulations of the model, calibrated on U.S. data, indicate that screening is highly imperfect, with almost half of all patents issued on inventions that do not require the patent incentive.

This finding contrasts sharply with priors we elicited from 103 payday lending and behavioural economics experts, who believed that the average borrower would be highly overoptimistic about getting out of debt. Borrowers are willing to pay a significant premium for an experimental incentive to avoid future borrowing, which we show implies that they perceive themselves to be time inconsistent. We use borrowers’ predicted behaviour and valuation of the experimental incentive to estimate a model of present focus and naivete. We then use the model to study common payday lending regulations.

Although fiscal expansions can raise domestic economic activity through various channels, they can also have crowding-out effects if the resources used to acquire public debt reduce domestic consumption and investment. These crowding-out effects are likely to be weaker when governments have access to foreign savings when selling their debt, leading to larger fiscal multipliers. We test this hypothesis for the U.S. in the post-war period and for a panel of 17 advanced economies from the 1980s to the present. To do so, we assemble a novel database of public debt holdings by domestic and foreign creditors for these countries. We combine these data with standard measures of fiscal policy shocks and show that, indeed, the size of fiscal multipliers is increasing in the share of public debt held by foreigners. In particular, the fiscal multiplier is smaller than one when the foreign share is low, such as in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s and Japan today, and larger than one when the foreign share is high, such as in the U.S. and several European countries today.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a89_3ay_3a2022_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1155-1204..htm,10.1093/restud/rdab055

There is little association between commitment contract take-up and reduced-form and structural estimates of actual or perceived time inconsistency.

Our main result is that, for any continuous objective function and under stable matching mechanisms, the optimal design can be attained by splitting agents into at most three indifference classes for each object. We provide insights into this design problem in three applications: distance-based scores in Boston Public Schools, test-based scores for Chicago exam schools, and income-based scores in New York public housing allocation.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a89_3ay_3a2022_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1245-1277..htm,10.1093/restud/rdab053

Such liquidity risk dissuades the transformation of short-term deposits into long-term loans and deters long-term investment. To validate this mechanism, we exploit a Sharia-compliant levy in Pakistan, which generates unintended and quasi-experimental variation in liquidity risk, with data from the credit registry and firm imports.

We use the data to examine alternative explanations, propose a tractable quantitative model with two-sided heterogeneity that rationalizes the observed moments, and calibrate it to explore general equilibrium counterfactuals. We find that larger, more productive firms sort into catering to the taste of richer households, and that this gives rise to asymmetric effects on household price indices.

For the dependents in a household (children), our estimates suggest that being induced to move by the “lava shock” dramatically raised lifetime earnings and education. While large, these estimates come with a substantial amount of statistical uncertainty. The benefits of moving were very unequally distributed across generations: the household heads (parents) were made slightly worse off by the shock. These results suggest large barriers to moving for the children, which imply that labour does not flow to locations where it earns the highest returns. The large gains from moving for the young are surprising in light of the fact that the town affected by our volcanic experiment was (and is) a relatively high income town.

Entrepreneurs need credit to undertake investment projects, some of which enable them to divert resources. Lenders can protect themselves from such diversion in two ways: collateralization, and costly screening that generates durable information about projects. In equilibrium, the collateralization-screening mix depends on the value of aggregate collateral. High collateral values make it possible to reallocate resources towards productive projects, but they also crowd out screening. This has important dynamic implications. During credit booms driven by high collateral values (e.g. real estate booms), economic activity expands but the economy’s stock of information on existing projects gets depleted. As a result, collateral-driven booms end in deep crises and slow recoveries: when booms end, investment is constrained both by the lack of collateral and by the lack of information on existing projects, which takes time to rebuild. We provide empirical support for the mechanism using US firm-level data.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a89_3ay_3a2022_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a517-555..htm,10.1093/restud/rdab046

We analyse the equilibria of two versions of the model that depend on when uncertainty resolves, which determines the available risk-sharing possibilities between workers and firms. We provide a thorough analysis of equilibrium comparative statics regarding changes in risk, worker and firm heterogeneity, and technology. We derive conditions on the match output function and risk attitudes under which these shifts lead to more investment and show how this affects matching and wages. To illustrate the applied relevance of our theory, we provide a stylized quantitative assessment of the model and analyse the sources (risk, heterogeneity, or technology) of rising U.S. wage inequality.

We characterize the asymptotic distributions of these test statistics and their permutation distributions under randomness, under a set of general stationary processes, and under a class of Markov chain alternatives, which allow us to derive their local asymptotic power. The results are applied to evaluate the empirical support for the hot hand fallacy provided by four controlled basketball shooting experiments. We establish that substantially larger data sets are required to derive an informative measurement of the deviation from randomness in basketball shooting. In one experiment, for which we were able to obtain data, multiple testing procedures reveal that one shooter exhibits a shooting pattern significantly inconsistent with randomness—supplying strong evidence that basketball shooting is not random for all shooters all of the time. However, we find that the evidence against randomness in this experiment is limited to this shooter.

Regardless of whether we identify government spending shocks from (1) a narrative approach or (2) a timing restriction, we find that the contractionary multiplier—the multiplier associated with a negative shock to government spending—is above 1 and largest in times of economic slack. In contrast, the expansionary multiplier—the multiplier associated with a positive shock—is substantially below 1 regardless of the state of the cycle.

When insurance contracts are composed of (1) a UI payment and (2) a severance payment paid at the onset of unemployment, offering contracts with different ratios of UI benefits to severance payment is optimal under the equivalent of a single-crossing condition: job seekers in higher need of unemployment insurance should be less prone to moral hazard. In that setting, a menu allows the planner to attract job seekers with a high need for insurance in a contract with generous UI benefits, and to attract job seekers most prone to moral hazard in a separate contract with a large severance payment but little unemployment insurance.

The framework is motivated by an equivalence result: the orthogonality between a shift-share instrument and an unobserved residual can be represented as the orthogonality between the underlying shocks and a shock-level unobservable. SSIV regression coefficients can similarly be obtained from an equivalent shock-level regression, motivating shock-level conditions for their consistency.

Our application is a New Keynesian economy where the central bank has non-contractible information about aggregate demand shocks and cannot commit to policy. Incentives are provided to the central bank via punishment which is socially costly. Instrument-based rules condition incentives on the central bank’s observable choice of policy, whereas target-based rules condition incentives on the outcomes of policy, such as inflation, which depend on both the policy choice and realized shocks. We show that the optimal rule within each class takes a threshold form, imposing the worst punishment upon violation. Target-based rules dominate instrument-based rules if and only if the central bank’s information is sufficiently precise, and they are relatively more attractive the less severe the central bank’s commitment problem.

We develop an algorithm that fully partitions the network into communities (coordination sets) within which agents have the same propensity to adopt. Our main finding is that a novel measure of network connectedness, which we term “social connectedness,” determines the propensity to adopt for each agent. Social connectedness captures both the number of links each agent has within her community (interconnectedness) as well as the number of links she has with members of other communities who have a higher propensity to adopt (embeddedness). There is a single coordination set if and only if the network is balanced—that is, the average degree of each subnetwork is no larger than the average degree of the network.

The developed theory allows to study the endogenous determination of labour-replacing, that is, automation technology through the lens of directed technical change theory. In an assignment model with a continuum of differentially skilled workers and capital, where capital perfectly substitutes for labour in the production of tasks, any increase in the relative supply of skilled workers stimulates investment into improving the productivity of capital, potentially leading skill premia to increase in relative skill supply.

This type is unobservable to private agents, who learn about it through the actions of the policy maker. Higher beliefs that the policy maker is the commitment type (i.e. the policy maker’s reputation) help promote good behaviour by private agents. We show that in a large class of economies, preserving uncertainty about the policy maker’s type is preferable from an ex ante perspective. If the initial reputation is not too high, the optimal rule is the strictest one that is incentive compatible for the optimizing type.

Such interventions allow the central bank to address the pecuniary externality, but they are also costly, as foreigners make carry trade profits. We analytically characterize the optimal intervention policy that solves this trade-off: (1) the optimal policy leans against the wind, stabilizing the exchange rate; (2) it involves smooth spreads but allows exchange rates to jump; (3) it partly relies on “forward guidance,” with non-zero interventions even after the shock has subsided; (4) it requires credibility, in that central banks do not intervene without commitment.

The model highlights a new transmission mechanism for macroeconomic shocks and successfully matches several empirical patterns that we document using data on U.S. car markets around the Great Recession. After a tightening of the borrowing limit, debt-constrained households postpone the decision to scrap and upgrade their low-quality cars, which depresses mid-quality car prices. In turn, this effect reduces wealthy households’ incentives to replace their mid-quality cars with high-quality ones, thereby decreasing new-car sales.

Exploiting the rich data and unique policy context in Sweden, we propose two alternative approaches that relax this assumption and we implement all three methods on the same sample of workers. The first approach considers the difference in marginal propensity to consume (MPC) when unemployed versus employed, which allows to identify the difference in prices to smooth consumption in the respective states. The second approach exploits UI choices embedded in the Swedish UI system in a Revealed Preference approach. While the drop in consumption expenditures is relatively small (13%), we find that the MPC is around 25% higher when unemployed than employed, translating into a marginal value of transfers that is at least % higher when unemployed than employed. This high value of UI is confirmed by our RP estimates and indicates substantial risk aversion given the relatively small drop in consumption expenditures.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a88_3ay_3a2021_3ai_3a6_3ap_3a3041-3085..htm,10.1093/restud/rdaa086

These higher moments are available without parametric assumptions on the variance process. In contrast, previous approaches exploiting heteroskedasticity rely on the path of innovation covariances, which can only be recovered from the data under specific parametric assumptions on the variance process. The conditions for identification are testable. I compare the identification scheme to existing approaches in simulations and provide guidance for estimation and inference. I use the methodology to estimate fiscal multipliers peaking at 0.86 for tax cuts and 0.75 for government spending. I find that tax shocks explain more variation in output at longer horizons.

Sexual safety is an important but hidden partner attribute, especially in areas where HIV is endemic. A model of positive assortative matching with both observable (attractiveness) and hidden (sexual safety) attributes predicts that removing the asymmetric information about sexual safety accelerates marriage and pregnancy for safe respondents, and more so if they are also attractive. Frequent HIV testing may enable safe people to signal and screen. Consistent with these predictions, we show that a high-frequency, “opt-out” HIV testing intervention changed beliefs about partner’s safety and accelerated marriage and pregnancy, increasing the probabilities of marriage and pregnancy by 26 and 27 for baseline-unmarried women over 28 months. Estimates are larger for safe and attractive respondents. Conversely, a single-test intervention lacks these effects, consistent with other HIV testing evaluations in the literature.

Such equilibria can support full cooperation if the stage game is either “strictly supermodular and mild” or “strongly supermodular,” and otherwise permit no cooperation at all.

We show that this gap can be entirely attributed to three factors: experience on the platform (learning-by-doing), preferences and constraints over where to work (driven largely by where drivers live and, to a lesser extent, safety), and preferences for driving speed. We do not find that men and women are differentially affected by a taste for specific hours, a return to within-week work intensity, or customer discrimination. Our results suggest that, in a “gig” economy setting with no gender discrimination and highly flexible labour markets, women’s relatively high opportunity cost of non-paid-work time and gender-based differences in preferences and constraints can sustain a gender pay gap.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a88_3ay_3a2021_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a2210-2238..htm,10.1093/restud/rdaa081

In a dynamic general equilibrium model with idiosyncratic shocks, incomplete markets, and subsistence requirements, farmers in developing countries use fewer intermediate inputs because it limits their exposure to uninsurable shocks. The calibrated model implies that Indian agricultural productivity would increase by 16% if markets were complete, driven by quantitatively important increases in both the average real intermediate share and measured TFP through lower misallocation. I then extend the results to consider the importance of risk in other contexts. First, the introduction of insurance decreases cross-country differences in agricultural labour productivity by 14%. Second, scaling the introduction of improved seeds to decrease downside risk reduces inequality by reallocating resources from rich to poor farmers via equilibrium effects. This reallocation substantially increases aggregate productivity relative to what would be expected from extrapolating the partial equilibrium impact.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a88_3ay_3a2021_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a2275-2307..htm,10.1093/restud/rdaa084

I develop a new approach, which I term narrow thinking, to systematically model narrow bracketing. The definition of narrow thinking is that different decisions are based on different, non-nested, information. As a result, the narrow thinker makes each decision with imperfect knowledge of other decisions and faces difficulties coordinating her multiple decisions. The narrow thinker effectively cares less about her other decisions when making each decision. The main application of narrow thinking is to provide a smooth model of mental accounting without requiring the decision maker to have explicit budgets. My approach generates unique predictions about how the degree of mental accounting depends on expenditure shares and cognitive limitations. It also illustrates how narrow bracketing and mental accounting can be explained by the same underlying friction.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a88_3ay_3a2021_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a2344-2374..htm,10.1093/restud/rdaa090

We derive an augmented Baily–Chetty formula showing that the optimal generosity of the social insurance system depends on a macroeconomic stabilization term. This term pushes for an increase in generosity when the level of economic activity is more responsive to social programmes in recessions than in booms. A calibration to the US economy shows that taking concerns for macroeconomic stabilization into account substantially raises the optimal unemployment insurance replacement rate but has a negligible impact on the optimal progressivity of the income tax.

In the limit as inventory costs become fully recoverable, the equilibrium converges to an equilibrium of the game where firms only choose prices and produce to order—the associated Bertrand game (examples of which include fully asymmetric clearinghouse models). Thus, away from that limit, our work generalizes Bertrand-type equilibria to production in advance, and challenges the commonly held view associating production in advance with Cournot outcomes. The analysis involves, as an intermediate step, mapping the price-inventory game into an asymmetric all-pay contest with outside options and non-monotonic winning and losing functions.

We analyse various rules and find that when political polarization is high, harsh fiscal rules (e.g. government shutdown) maximize the opposition’s bargaining power and lead to lower debt accumulation. When polarization is low, less strict fiscal limits (e.g. balanced-budget rule) are preferable. Moreover, we find that the optimal fiscal rules could arise in equilibrium by negotiation.

We show that these cutoffs can be computed directly from the distribution of preferences and priorities in a continuum model and derive closed-form solutions and comparative statics for parameterized settings.

It provides a sharp link between these facts and the nature of merger gains. At the micro-level, both complementarities between merging firms and productivity improvements of target firms are important in generating gains. At the macro-level, the model suggests a significant beneficial impact of M&A on aggregate outcomes—the contribution to steady state output is 14 and 4 for consumption—which occurs through the reallocation of resources across firms and equilibrium effects on firm selection and new entrepreneurship. Nevertheless, the economy is not efficient, suggesting a scope for policy improvements—a simple flat tax on M&A can raise steady state consumption as much as 2 relative to the laissez-faire equilibrium.

We discuss the comparative statics of a theoretical model in which the (negative) social attitudes toward working women might contribute to the relatively lower marriage rate of skilled women and might also induce a non-monotonic relationship between their labour market prospects and their marriage outcomes. The model delivers predictions about how the skilled–unskilled marriage gap should react to changes in labour market opportunities across economies with more or less conservative attitudes toward working women.

Researchers using survey or experimental panel data sets on prices and consumption to answer this question face the well-known problem of measurement error. We show that ignoring measurement error in the RP approach may lead to overrejection of the UMT. To solve this problem, we propose a new statistical RP framework for consumption panel data sets that allows for testing the UMT in the presence of measurement error. Our test is applicable to all consumer models that can be characterized by their first-order conditions. Our approach is non-parametric, allows for unrestricted heterogeneity in preferences and requires only a centring condition on measurement error. We develop two applications that provide new evidence about the UMT. First, we find support in a survey data set for the dynamic and time-consistent UMT in single-individual households, in the presence of nonclassical measurement error in consumption. In the second application, we cannot reject the static UMT in a widely used experimental data set in which measurement error in prices is assumed to be the result of price misperception due to the experimental design. The first finding stands in contrast to the conclusions drawn from the deterministic RP test of Browning (1989, International Economic Review, 979–992). The second finding reverses the conclusions drawn from the deterministic RP test of Afriat (1967, International Economic Review, 8, 6–77) and Varian (1982, Econometrica, 945–973).",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a88_3ay_3a2021_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a2042-2093..htm,10.1093/restud/rdaa067

We show that asymmetry can be defined at the level of the behavioural rule and that asymmetric rules can be mixed and matched whilst retaining asymmetry of the aggregate process. Specifically, we show robustness of asymmetry to heterogeneity within an agent (Alice follows different rules at different times); heterogeneity between agents (Alice and Bob follow different rules); and heterogeneity in the timing of strategy updating.

We consider -stage policy iteration (PI) estimators, wheredenotes the number of PIs employed in the estimation. This class nests several estimators proposed in the literature. By considering a “pseudo likelihood” criterion function, our estimator becomes the -pseudo maximum likelihood (PML) estimator in Aguirregabiria and Mira (2002, 2007). By considering a “minimum distance” criterion function, it defines a new -minimum distance (MD) estimator, which is an iterative version of the estimators in Pesendorfer and Schmidt-Dengler (2008) and Pakes et al.

This complements findings in Aguirregabiria and Mira (2007), who focus onandlarge enough to induce convergence of the estimator. Furthermore, we show under certain conditions that the asymptotic variance of the -PML estimator can exhibit arbitrary patterns as a function of . Second, we establish that the -MD estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal for any . For a specific weight matrix, the -MD estimator has the same asymptotic distribution as the -PML estimator.

The invariance result is especially unexpected given the findings in Aguirregabiria and Mira (2007) for -PML estimators.

First, the optimal -MD estimator is efficient in the class of -MD estimators for all . In other words, additional PIs do not provide first-order efficiency gains relative to the optimal -MD estimator.

Using network analysis tools, we explore how different social network structures affect technology diffusion and thereby a country’s rate of growth. The correlation between high-diffusion networks and income is strongly positive. But when we use a model to isolate the effect of a change in social networks on growth, the effect can be positive, negative, or zero. The reason is that networks diffuse both ideas and disease. Low-diffusion networks have evolved in countries where disease is prevalent because limited connectivity protects residents from epidemics. But a low-diffusion network in a low-disease environment compromises the diffusion of good ideas. In general, social networks have evolved to fit their economic and epidemiological environment.

Slums are modelled as a technology choice; however, institutional frictions in land markets may hinder their conversion to formal usage that requires secure property rights.

This article develops tools to measure the ex ante expected utility impact of insurance subsidies and mandates when choices are observed after some insurable information is revealed. The approach retains the transparency of using reduced-form willingness to pay and cost curves, but it adds one additional sufficient statistic: the percentage difference in marginal utilities between insured and uninsured. I provide an approach to estimate this additional statistic that uses only the reduced-form willingness to pay curve, combined with a measure of risk aversion. I compare the approach to structural approaches that require fully specifying the choice environment and information sets of individuals. I apply the approach using existing willingness to pay and cost curve estimates from the low-income health insurance exchange in Massachusetts.

A buyer receives information about her willingness-to-pay for the seller’s product over time, and decides when to make a one-time purchase. The seller does not know how the buyer learns but commits to a pricing strategy to maximize profits against the worst-case information arrival process. We show that a constant price path delivers the robustly optimal profit, with profit and price both lower than under known values. Thus, under the robust objective, intertemporal incentives do not arise at the optimum, despite the possibility for information arrival to influence the timing of purchases. We delineate whether constant prices remain optimal (or not) when the seller seeks robustness against a subset of information arrival processes.

The optimal timing of pay trades off the costs of deferred compensation arising from the agent’s relative impatience and potential consumption smoothing needs against the benefit of exploiting additional informative signals. By capturing this information benefit of deferral in terms of the likelihood ratio dynamics, our characterization covers general signal processes in a unified setting. With bilateral risk neutrality and agent limited liability, optimal contracts are high-powered and stipulate at most two payout dates. If the agent is additionally risk-averse, payouts are contingent on performance exceeding a hurdle that is increasing over time.

A key yet elusive prediction of this hypothesis is that providers ought to be able to cut back on care without sacrificing quality. This article examines the effects of a particular form of provider cutbacks—those generated by physicians working in high-pressure peer group environments. Using expansive, time-stamped discharge data from 137 hospital-based emergency departments, I document that physicians systematically alter their pace and intensity of care across frequently shuffled peer groups. Peer groups that induce a physician to work faster also induce her to order fewer tests and spend less money. Contrary to the flat-of-the-curve hypothesis, these cutbacks lead to large reductions in quality of care. This evidence, paired with the fact that slower physicians do not produce better average outcomes, suggests that cross-physician differences in resource utilization reflect substantial differences in physician productivity within a hospital.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a88_3ay_3a2021_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1385-1417..htm,10.1093/restud/rdaa054

The ensuing scarcity generates a demand for “unbacked” assets, i.e., assets that are backed only by the expectation of their future value. We consider two types of unbacked assets: bubbles, which are created by the private sector, and money, which is created by the central bank. Bubbles and money share many features, but they also differ in two crucial respects. First, while the rents from the creation of bubbles accrue to entrepreneurs and foster investment, the rents from money creation accrue to the central bank. Second, while bubbles are driven by market psychology, and can rise and fall according to the whims of the market, money is under the control of the central bank. We characterize the optimal monetary policy and show that, through its ability to supply assets, monetary policy plays a key role in the bubbly world.

We argue that a core role of communication is to transmit information that helps co-workers do their job better. We build a simple model in which workers choose the amount of communication by trading off this benefit against the time cost incurred by the sender, and use it to derive a set of empirical predictions. We then exploit a natural experiment in an organization where problems arrive and must be sequentially dealt with by two workers. For exogenous reasons, the first worker can sometimes communicate face-to-face with their colleague. Consistently with the predictions of our model, we find that: (1) the second worker works faster (at the cost of the first worker having less time to deal with incoming problems) when face-to-face communication is possible, (2) this effect is stronger when the second worker is busier and for homogenous and closely located teams, and (3) the (career) incentives of workers determine how much they communicate with their colleagues. We also find that workers partially internalise social outcomes in their communication decisions.

The attempt to rationalize the deviation may lead players to revise their beliefs about the deviator’s behaviour in the continuation of the game. This instance of forward induction reasoning is based on interactive beliefs about not just rationality, but also the compliance with the agreement itself. I study the effects of such rationalization on the self-enforceability of the agreement. Accordingly, outcomes of the game are deemed implementable by some agreement or not. Conclusions depart substantially from what the traditional equilibrium refinements suggest. A non-subgame perfect equilibrium outcome may be induced by a self-enforcing agreement, while a subgame perfect equilibrium outcome may not. The incompleteness of the agreement can be crucial to implement an outcome.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a88_3ay_3a2021_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a610-642..htm,10.1093/restud/rdaa051

We find that most firms use a lot of foreign inputs, but only a small number of firms show that dependence through direct imports. While direct exporters are rare, a majority of firms are indirectly exporting. In most firms, however, indirect export is quantitatively modest, and sales at home are the key source of revenue.

We use three identification strategies: ordinary least squares with a rich set of controls, the Saiz housing supply elasticity instrument, and a new instrument that exploits systematic differences in city-level exposure to regional house price cycles. All three identification strategies indicate that housing wealth elasticities were if anything slightly smaller in the 2000s than in earlier time periods. This implies that the important role housing played in the boom and bust of the 2000s was due to larger price movements rather than an increase in the sensitivity of consumption to house prices. Full-sample estimates based on our new instrument are smaller than recent estimates, though they remain economically important. We find no significant evidence of a boom–bust asymmetry in the housing wealth elasticity. We show that these empirical results are consistent with the behaviour of the housing wealth elasticity in a standard life-cycle model with borrowing constraints, uninsurable income risk, illiquid housing, and long-term mortgages. In our model, the housing wealth elasticity is relatively insensitive to changes in the distribution ofloan-to-value (LTV) for two reasons: first, low-leverage homeowners account for a substantial and stable part of the aggregate housing wealth elasticity; second, a rightward shift in the LTV distribution increases not only the number of highly sensitive constrained agents but also the number of underwater agents whose consumption is insensitive to house prices.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a88_3ay_3a2021_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a669-707..htm,10.1093/restud/rdaa018

Limited attention implies that consumers can only “study” a small number of complex products in full, while—by failing to check secondary features—they can superficially “browse” more. Interventions limiting ex post consumer harm through safety regulations, caps on certain fees, or other methods induce consumers to do more or more meaningful browsing, enhancing competition. We show that for a pro-competitive effect to obtain, the regulation must apply to the secondary features, and not to the total price or value of the product. As an auxiliary positive prediction, we establish that because low-value consumers are often more likely to study—and therefore less likely to browse—than high-value consumers, the average price consumers pay can be increasing in the share of low-value consumers. We discuss applications of our insights to health-insurance choice, the European Union’s principle on unfair contract terms, food safety in developing countries, and the shopping behaviour of (and prices paid by) low-income and high-income consumers.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a88_3ay_3a2021_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a708-729..htm,10.1093/restud/rdaa056

Villages that were brought under centralized rule one century earlier experienced a doubling of violence during the state-organized 1994 genocide. Instrumental variable estimates exploiting differences in the proximity to Nyanza—an early capital—suggest that these effects are causal. Before the genocide, when the state faced rebel attacks, with longer state presence, violence is lower. Using data from several sources, including a lab-in-the-field experiment across an abandoned historical boundary, I show that the effect of the historical state is primarily sustained by culturally transmitted norms of obedience. The persistent effect of the pre-colonial state interacts with government policy: where the state developed earlier, there is more violence when the Rwandan government mobilized for mass killing and less violence when the government pursued peace.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a88_3ay_3a2021_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a730-763..htm,10.1093/restud/rdaa028

The article is the first to solve this problem with general discounting and general functional forms. With time-inconsistent preferences, a commitment device that allows a planner to choose climate policy for multiple periods is potentially very valuable. Nevertheless, our quantitative results show that while a permanent commitment device would be very valuable, the ability to commit policy for “only” 100 years adds less than 2% to the value of climate policy without commitment. We solve a log-linear version of the model analytically, generating a formula for the optimal carbon tax that includes the formula in Golosov et al. (2014, Econometrica, 82, 41–88) as a special case.

Using about 265,000 sequences of a game of alternating-offer bargaining following an ascending auction in the wholesale used-car industry, this study estimates (or bounds) distributions of buyer and seller values and evaluates where realized bargaining outcomes lie relative to efficient outcomes. Results demonstrate that the ex-ante and ex-post efficient outcomes are close to one another, but that the real bargaining falls short of both, suggesting that the bargaining is indeed inefficient but that this inefficiency is not solely due to the information constraints highlighted in Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983).

We exploit two natural experiments in Harris County, Texas where first-time felony defendants faced abrupt changes in the probability of diversion. Using administrative data and regression discontinuity methods, we find robust evidence across both experiments that diversion cuts reoffending rates in half and grows quarterly employment rates by nearly 50% over 10 years. The change in trajectory persists even 20 years out and is concentrated among young black men. An investigation of mechanisms strongly suggests that stigma associated with a felony conviction plays a key role in generating these results.

Despite persisting interest in them, the asymptotic distributions of likelihood ratio-based tests for detecting regime switching remain unknown. This study examines such tests and establishes their asymptotic distributions in the context of nonlinear models, allowing multiple parameters to be affected by regime switching. The analysis addresses three difficulties: (i) some nuisance parameters are unidentified under the null hypothesis, (ii) the null hypothesis yields a local optimum, and (iii) the conditional regime probabilities follow stochastic processes that can only be represented recursively. Addressing these issues permits substantial power gains in empirically relevant settings. This study also presents the following results: (1) a characterization of the conditional regime probabilities and their derivatives with respect to the model’s parameters, (2) a high-order approximation to the log-likelihood ratio, (3) a refinement of the asymptotic distribution, and (4) a unified algorithm to simulate the critical values. For models that are linear under the null hypothesis, the elements needed for the algorithm can all be computed analytically. Furthermore, the above results explain why some bootstrap procedures can be inconsistent, and why standard information criteria can be sensitive to the hypothesis and the model structure. When applied to US quarterly real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate data, the methods detect relatively strong evidence favouring the regime-switching specification. Lastly, we apply the methods in the context of dynamic stochastic equilibrium models and obtain similar results as the GDP case.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a88_3ay_3a2021_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a937-968..htm,10.1093/restud/rdaa035

We show that the presence of dispersed information and imperfect competition in secondary markets, interacted with financial constraints, results in mispricing and misallocation of aggregate risk, distorts aggregate investment, and exacerbates asset price and output volatility. The magnitude of balance sheet amplification effects becomes endogenously tied to the severity of market frictions, which likely vary over time and across economies. The laissez-faire equilibrium is constrained inefficient due to a novel externality originating from rent-extracting behaviour of agents in secondary markets. Optimal corrective policy boosts secondary market liquidity through subsidies to trade in macro-contingent claims, which enhances aggregate risk-sharing and stabilizes the business cycle.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a88_3ay_3a2021_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a44-90..htm,10.1093/restud/rdaa069

In the short-run partial equilibrium, output and capital increase with microfinance but total factor productivity (TFP) falls. In the long run, when general equilibrium effects are considered, as should be for economy-wide microfinance interventions, scaling up microfinance has only a small impact on per-capita income, because an increase in TFP is offset by lower capital accumulation.

In risky environments, a person is less likely to sacrifice utility on one dimension to gain utility on another that is made riskier.

The results show that a skill selective immigration policy leads to welfare gains for low skill workers, but welfare losses for high skill workers. The negative impacts are more substantial among the incumbent high skill immigrants. Internal migration mitigates the initial negative impacts, particularity in cities where housing supplies are inelastic. However, the negative wage impacts on some workers intensify. This is because an out-migration of workers of a given type may raise the local wages for workers of that type, while reducing the local wages of workers with complementary characteristics.

The previous literature has shown that the cases in which this is possible are sharply limited. We show that if some of the feasibility constraints can be treated as goals rather than hard constraints, then, subject to weak conditions that we identify, any expected allocation that satisfies all the constraints and goals can be implemented by randomizing among nearby integer allocations that satisfy all the hard constraints exactly and the goals approximately. By defining ex post utilities as goals, we are able to improve the ex post properties of several classic assignment mechanisms, such as the random serial dictatorship. We use the same approach to prove the existence of $\epsilon$-competitive equilibrium in large markets with indivisible items and feasibility constraints.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a87_3ay_3a2020_3ai_3a6_3ap_3a2473-2510..htm,10.1093/restud/rdz066

Agents therefore prefer to acquire complex skills, to earn large rents. In our overlapping generations model, their ability to do so is kept in check by competition with predecessors. Old agents, however, are imperfect substitutes for young ones, because the latter are easier to incentivize, thanks to longer horizons. This reduces competition between generations, enabling young managers to go for larger complexity than their predecessors.

Its focus is on the interplay between debt and entitlements. In our model, both are tools by which temporarily powerful groups can extract resources from groups that will be powerful in the future: debt transfers resources across periods; entitlements directly target the future allocation of resources. We prove the following results. First, the presence of endogenous entitlements dampens the incentives of politically powerful groups to accumulate debt, but it leads to an increase in total government obligations. Second, fiscal rules can have perverse effects: if entitlements are unconstrained, and there are capital market frictions, debt limits lead to an increase in total government obligations and to worse outcomes for all groups. Analogous results hold for entitlement limits. Third, our model sheds some lights on the influence of capital market frictions on the incentives of governments to adopt fiscal rules, and implement entitlement programs.

The effect is driven by drugs that reduce medical expenditure and treat chronic conditions.

In the model, unions arise endogenously through a majority election within firms. As union wages are set through a collective bargaining process, unionization compresses wages and lowers profits. To prevent unionization, non-union firms over-hire high-skill workers— who vote against the union— and under-hire low-skill workers— who vote in its favour. As a consequence of this distortion in hiring, firms that are threatened by unionization hire fewer workers, produce less and pay a more concentrated distribution of wages. In the calibrated economy, the threat of unionization has a significant negative impact on aggregate output, but it also reduces wage inequality.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a87_3ay_3a2020_3ai_3a6_3ap_3a2859-2892..htm,10.1093/restud/rdaa027

We then evaluate expansions of current arrangements for the U.S. and find that expansions of conditional transfers have substantial positive effects on female labour supply, that are largest at the bottom of the skill distribution. Expanding childcare credits leads to long-run increases in the participation of married females of 10.6%, while an equivalent expansion of child credits leads to the opposite ($-$2.4%).

We show that the presence of ironing rationalizes a number of empirical patterns in individuals’ perceptions of tax liability across the income distribution. Furthermore, while our empirical framework accommodates a rich class of other misperceptions, we find that a simple model including only ironers and correct forecasters accurately predicts average underestimation of marginal tax rates. We replicate our finding of prevalent ironing, and a lack of other systematic misperceptions, in a controlled experiment that studies real-stakes decisions across exogenously varied tax schedules. To illustrate the policy relevance of the ironing heuristic, we show that it augments the benefits of progressive taxation in a standard model of earnings choice.

204,Review of Economic Studies,A Bias Bound Approach to Non-parametric Inference,['Susanne Schennach'],"2020, vol. 87, issue 5, 2439-2472",[],"Abstract: The traditional approach to obtain valid confidence intervals for non-parametric quantities is to select a smoothing parameter such that the bias of the estimator is negligible relative to its standard deviation. While this approach is apparently simple, it has two drawbacks: first, the question of optimal bandwidth selection is no longer well-defined, as it is not clear what ratio of bias to standard deviation should be considered negligible. Second, since the bandwidth choice necessarily deviates from the optimal (mean squares-minimizing) bandwidth, such a confidence interval is very inefficient. To address these issues, we construct valid confidence intervals that account for the presence of a non-negligible bias and thus make it possible to perform inference with optimal mean squared error minimizing bandwidths. The key difficulty in achieving this involves finding a strict, yet feasible, bound on the bias of a non-parametric estimator. It is well-known that it is not possible to consistently estimate the pointwise bias of an optimal non-parametric estimator (for otherwise, one could subtract it and obtain a faster convergence rate violating Stone’s bounds on the optimal convergence rates). Nevertheless, we find that, under minimal primitive assumptions, it is possible to consistently estimate an upper bound on the magnitude of the bias, which is sufficient to deliver a valid confidence interval whose length decreases at the optimal rate and which does not contradict Stone’s results.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a87_3ay_3a2020_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a2439-2472..htm,10.1093/restud/rdz065

We use administrative data on the net wealth of a large sample of Swedish adoptees merged with similar information for their biological and adoptive parents. Comparing the relationship between the wealth of adopted and biological parents and that of the adopted child, we find that, even prior to any inheritance, there is a substantial role for environment and a much smaller role for pre-birth factors and we find little evidence that nature/nurture interactions are important. When bequests are taken into account, the role of adoptive parental wealth becomes much stronger. Our findings suggest that wealth transmission is not primarily because children from wealthier families are inherently more talented or more able but that, even in relatively egalitarian Sweden, wealth begets wealth. We further build on the existing literature by providing a more comprehensive view of the role of nature and nurture on intergenerational mobility, looking at a wide range of different outcomes using a common sample and method. We find that environmental influences are relatively more important for wealth-related variables such as savings and investment decisions than for human capital.

Schools are endowed with priorities over students. Incorporating constraints from different applications, priorities are often modelled as choice functions over sets of students. It has been argued that the most desirable criterion for an assignment is stability; there should not exist any blocking pair: no student shall prefer some school to her assigned school and have higher priority than some student who got into that school or the school has an empty seat. We propose a blocking notion where in addition it must be possible to assign the student to her preferred school. We then define the following stability criterion for a set of assignments: a set of assignments is legal if and only if any assignment outside the set is blocked with some assignment in the set and no two assignments inside the set block each other. We show that under very basic conditions on priorities, there always exists a unique legal set of assignments, and that this set has a structure common to the set of stable assignments: (i) it is a lattice and (ii) it satisfies the rural hospitals theorem. The student-optimal legal assignment is efficient and provides a solution for the conflict between stability and efficiency.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a87_3ay_3a2020_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a1837-1875..htm,10.1093/restud/rdz041

We show that after controlling for composition effects likely involving procyclical upgrading of job match quality, the wages of new hires are no more cyclical than those of existing workers. The key implication is that the sluggish behaviour of wages for existing workers is a better guide to the cyclicality of the marginal cost of labour than is the high measured cyclicality of new hires wages unadjusted for composition effects. Key to our identification is distinguishing between new hires from unemployment versus those who are job changers. We argue that to a reasonable approximation, the wages of the former provide a composition-free estimate of the wage flexibility, while the same is not true for the latter.

When the errors are Gaussian, independence is equivalent to non-correlation and these models face two identification issues. The first identification problem is “static” and is due to the fact that there is an infinite number of linear transformations of a given random vector making its components uncorrelated. The second identification problem is “dynamic” and is a consequence of the fact that, even if a SVARMA admits a non-invertible moving average (MA) matrix polynomial, it may feature the same second-order dynamic properties as a VARMA process in which the MA matrix polynomials are invertible (the fundamental representation). The aim of this article is to explain that these difficulties are mainly due to the Gaussian assumption, and that both identification challenges are solved in a non-Gaussian framework if the structural shocks are assumed to be instantaneously and serially independent. We develop new parametric and semi-parametric estimation methods that accommodate non-fundamentalness in the MA dynamics. The functioning and performances of these methods are illustrated by applications conducted on both simulated and real data.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a87_3ay_3a2020_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a1915-1953..htm,10.1093/restud/rdz028

An empirical concern is that the resulting estimates may reflect unobserved, simultaneous determinants of firm performance, network connections, and external R&D. I address this problem with an innovative IV strategy, motivated by a game-theoretic model of firm interaction. I instrument the R&D of one firm’s connections with that of other firms that are sufficiently distant in network space.

This article investigates how such technology should be implemented when designing pairwise kidney exchange programs. The possibility to receive a kidney transplant from a blood group incompatible donor motivates an extension of the preference domain, allowing patients to distinguish between compatible donors and half-compatible donors (i.e. blood group incompatible donors that only become compatible after undergoing an immunosuppressive treatment). It is demonstrated that the number of transplants can be substantially increased by providing an incentive for patients with half-compatible donors to participate in kidney exchange programs. The results also suggest that the technology is beneficial for patient groups that are traditionally disadvantaged in kidney exchange programs (e.g. blood group O patients).

Our main results show that insights substantially differ from those of the standard model without externalities: there can be multiple competitive equilibria with different sorting patterns; both optimal and competitive equilibrium matching can involve randomization; and competitive equilibrium can be inefficient with a matching that can drastically deviate from the optimal one.

We derive a ""pecking order"" result, whereby segmentation is a second-best measure that coordinated governments should use only when tax capacity constrains them from injecting liquidity.

We consider a dynamic search model in which foreclosures freeze the market for non-foreclosures and reduce price and sales volume by eroding lender equity, destroying the credit of potential buyers, and making buyers more selective. These effects cause price-default spirals that amplify an initial shock and help the model fit both national and cross-sectional moments better than a model without foreclosure. When calibrated to the recent bust, the model reveals that the amplification generated by foreclosures is significant: ruined credit and choosey buyers account for 25.4% of the total decline in non-distressed prices and lender losses account for an additional 22.6%. For policy, we find that principal reduction is less cost-effective than lender equity injections or introducing a single seller that holds foreclosures off the market until demand rebounds.

228,Review of Economic Studies,Does Advertising Serve as a Signal? Evidence from a Field Experiment in Mobile Search,"['Navdeep S Sahni', 'Harikesh Nair']","2020, vol. 87, issue 3, 1529-1564",[],"Abstract: We develop a field experiment that assesses whether advertising can serve as a signal that enhances consumers' evaluations of advertised goods. We implement the experiment on a mobile search platform that provides listings and reviews for an archetypal experience good, restaurants. In collaboration with the platform, we randomize about 200,000 users in 13 Asian cities into exposure of ads for about 600+ local restaurants. Within the exposure group, we randomly vary the disclosure to the consumer of whether a restaurant's listing is a paid-ad. This enables isolating the effect on outcomes of a user knowing that a listing is sponsored—a pure signalling effect. We find that this disclosure increases calls to the restaurant by 77%, holding fixed all other attributes of the ad. The disclosure effect is higher when the consumer uses the platform away from his typical city of search, when the uncertainty about restaurant quality is larger, and for restaurants that have received fewer ratings in the past. On the supply side, newer, higher rated and more popular restaurants are found to advertise more on the platform; and ratings of those that advertised during the experiment are found to be higher two years later. Taken together, we interpret these results as consistent with a signalling equilibrium in which ads serve as implicit signals that enhance the appeal of the advertised restaurants to consumers. Both consumers and advertisers seem to benefit from the signalling. Consumers shift choices towards restaurants that are better rated (at baseline) in the disclosure group compared to the no disclosure group, and advertisers gain from the improved outcomes induced by disclosure.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a87_3ay_3a2020_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1529-1564..htm,10.1093/restud/rdz053

In an environment with weak state presence, this socialist threat triggered landowners, estate managers, and local politicians to turn to the Mafia to resist and combat peasant demands. We show that the location of the Peasant Fasci is significantly affected by a severe drought in 1893, and using information on rainfall, we estimate the impact of the Peasant Fasci on the location of the Mafia in 1900. We provide extensive evidence that rainfall before and after this critical period has no effect on the spread of the Mafia or various economic and political outcomes. In the second part of the article, we use this source of variation in the strength of the Mafia in 1900 to estimate its medium-term and long-term effects. We find significant and quantitatively large negative impacts of the Mafia on literacy and various public goods in the 1910s and 20s. We also show a sizable impact of the Mafia on political competition, which could be one of the channels via which it affected local economic outcomes. We document negative effects of the Mafia on longer-term outcomes (in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s) as well, but these are in general weaker and often only marginally significant.

First, we show that an exclusion restriction, typically used to identify empirical games, provides testable non-parametric restrictions of the null hypothesis of equilibrium beliefs in dynamic games with either finite or infinite horizon. We use this result to construct a simple Likelihood Ratio test of equilibrium beliefs. Second, we prove that this exclusion restriction, together with consistent estimates of beliefs at two points in the support of the variable involved in the exclusion restriction, is sufficient for non-parametric point-identification of players’ belief functions as well as useful functions of payoffs. Third, we propose a simple two-step estimation method. We illustrate our model and methods using both Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical application of a dynamic game of store location by retail chains. The key conditions for the identification of beliefs and payoffs in our application are the following: (1) the previous year’s network of stores of the competitor does not have a direct effect on the profit of a firm, but the firm’s own network of stores at previous year does affect its profit because the existence of sunk entry costs and economies of density in these costs; and (2) firms’ beliefs are unbiased in those markets that are close, in a geographic sense, to the opponent’s network of stores, though beliefs are unrestricted, and potentially biased, for unexplored markets which are farther away from the competitors’ network. Our estimates show significant evidence of biased beliefs. Furthermore, imposing the restriction of unbiased beliefs generates a substantial attenuation bias in the estimate of competition effects.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a87_3ay_3a2020_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a582-625..htm,10.1093/restud/rdz013

Across a wide range of civil services entry is competitive, promotion is constrained by seniority, jobs are for life, and retirement occurs at a fixed age. This implies that older entering officers, who are less likely to attain the glittering prize of reaching the top of the bureaucracy before they retire, may be less motivated to exert effort. Using a nationwide stakeholder survey and rich administrative data on elite civil servants in India, we provide evidence that: (i) officers who cannot reach the senior-most positions before they retire are perceived to be less effective and are more likely to be suspended and (ii) this effect is weakened by a reform that extends the retirement age.

In the U.K., the mortgage interest rate features discrete jumps—notches—at thresholds for the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. These notches generate large bunching below the critical LTV thresholds and missing mass above them. We develop a dynamic model that links these empirical moments to the underlying structural EIS. The average EIS is small, around 0.1, and quite homogeneous in the population. This finding is robust to structural assumptions and can allow for uncertainty, a wide range of risk preferences, portfolio reallocation, liquidity constraints, present bias, and optimization frictions.

A large U.S. transportation company is in the process of fitting its trucks with an electronic on-board recorder (EOBR) to provide drivers with information on their driving performance. The company also has commenced a multi-year initiative to remake its internal operations, the first phase of which focuses exclusively on changing values toward a greater emphasis on teamwork and empowerment. In this setting, a natural question is whether the optimal managerial practice consists of: (1) letting each driver know his or her individual performance only; or also (2) providing drivers with information about their performance with respect to other drivers. Using the EOBR-provided driver performance data, we randomize these practices across sites. The main result of our experiment is that (2) leads to better performance than (1) in a particular site if and only if the site has not yet received the values intervention, and worse performance if it has. The result is consistent with the presence of a conflict between competition-based managerial practices and a shift to a cooperation-based value system.

A long-lived consumer interacts with a sequence of firms. Each firm relies on the consumer’s current score–a linear aggregate of noisy purchase signals—to learn about her preferences and to set prices. If the consumer is strategic, she reduces her demand to manipulate her score, which reduces the average equilibrium price. Firms in turn prefer scores that overweigh past signals relative to applying Bayes’ rule with disaggregated data, as this mitigates the ratchet effect and maximizes the firms’ ability to price discriminate. Consumers with high average willingness to pay benefit from data collection, because the gains from low average prices dominate the losses from price discrimination. Finally, hidden scores—those only observed by the firms—reduce demand sensitivity, increase average prices, and reduce consumer surplus, sometimes below the naive-consumer level.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a87_3ay_3a2020_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a750-791..htm,10.1093/restud/rdz046

We find that these enrolees have flat spending in a period before the doughnut hole and a large spending drop in the gap, providing evidence against the benchmark model.

Exploiting a sharp policy-induced discontinuity in the cost of originating certain high-leverage mortgages, we study how the Dodd–Frank “Ability-to-Repay” rule affected the price and availability of credit in the U.S. mortgage market. Our estimates show that the policy had only moderate effects on prices, increasing interest rates on affected loans by 10–15 basis points. The effect on quantities, however, was significantly larger; we estimate that the policy eliminated 15% of the affected market completely and reduced leverage for another 20% of remaining borrowers. This reduction in quantities is much greater than would be implied by plausible demand elasticities and indicates that lenders responded to the policy not only by raising prices but also by exiting the regulated portion of the market. Heterogeneity in the quantity response across lenders suggests that agency costs may have been one particularly important market friction contributing to the large overall effect as the fall in lending was substantially larger among lenders relying on third-parties to originate loans. Finally, while the policy succeeded in reducing leverage, our estimates suggest this effect would have only slightly reduced aggregate default rates during the housing crisis.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a87_3ay_3a2020_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a914-958..htm,10.1093/restud/rdz040

Each recruited voter observes a private signal about the unknown state but does not learn the turnout.First, we characterize how the outcomes of large elections depend on the turnout pattern across states. In contrast to existing results for large elections, there are equilibria in which information aggregation fails whenever there is an asymmetry in turnout; information aggregation is only guaranteed in all equilibria if turnout is state independent. Second, when the turnout is the result of costly voter recruitment by a biased organizer, the organizer can ensure that its favourite policy $a$ is implemented with high probability independent of the state as the voter recruitment cost vanishes. Moreover, information aggregation will fail in all equilibria.

I show that countries with larger fiscal capacity should have lower ex ante minimum bank capital requirements, in an environment with endogenously incomplete markets and overinvestment due to “Too-Big-To-Fail” moral hazard and pecuniary externalities. I also show that, in addition to a minimum bank capital requirement, regulators in countries with strong “Too-Big-To-Fail” moral hazard should impose a limit on the liabilities pledged by financial institutions in a crisis state.

The literature on optimal carbon pricing often abstracts from other taxes. However, when governments raise revenues with distortionary taxes, carbon levies have fiscal impacts. While they raise revenues directly, they may shrink the bases of other taxes (e.g. by decreasing employment). This article theoretically characterizes and then quantifies optimal carbon taxes in a dynamic general equilibrium climate–economy model with distortionary fiscal policy. First, this article establishes a novel theoretical relationship between the optimal taxation of carbon and of capital income. This link arises because carbon emissions destroy natural capital: they accumulate in the atmosphere and decrease future output. Consequently, this article shows how the standard logic against capital income taxes extends to distortions on environmental capital investments. Second, this article characterizes optimal climate policy in sub-optimal fiscal settings where income taxes are constrained to remain at their observed levels. Third, this article presents a detailed calibration that builds on the seminal DICE approach but adds features essential for a setting with distortionary taxes, such as a differentiation between climate change production impacts (e.g. on agriculture) and direct utility impacts (e.g. on biodiversity existence value). The central quantitative finding is that optimal carbon tax schedules are 8–24% lower when there are distortionary taxes, compared to the setting with lump-sum taxes considered in the literature.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a87_3ay_3a2020_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a1-39..htm,10.1093/restud/rdz055

Though formulated as a precautionary-saving model à la Huggett–Aiyagari, its reduced form is a two-agent model with a highly concentrated wealth distribution. When prices are sticky and wages flexible, as in the textbook representative-agent model, monetary policy affects the distribution of consumption, but has no effect on output as workers choose not to change their hours worked in response to wage movements. This highlights a transmission mechanism of the textbook model that we find implausible: in response to a monetary stimulus, the representative worker’s labor supply is greatly affected by the profits she receives. First, the lower profits induced by higher wages raise labor supply through a wealth effect and, secondly, the mere presence of profits reduces the negative income effect of a wage rise.

A crucial difference between the housing tenure groups is the composition of their balance sheets: mortgagors hold sizable illiquid assets but little liquid wealth.

We show that areas close to where the Dutch established sugar factories in the mid-19th century are today more industrialized, have better infrastructure, are more educated, and are richer than nearby counterfactual locations that would have been similarly suitable for colonial sugar factories. We also show, using a spatial regression discontinuity design on the catchment areas around each factory, that villages forced to grow sugar cane have more village-owned land and also have more schools and substantially higher education levels, both historically and today.

We are particularly interested in characterizing the sudden and discrete nature of banking panics as well as the circumstances that make an economy vulnerable to such panics in some instances but not in others. Having a conventional macroeconomic model allows us to study the channels by which the crisis affects real activity both qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition to modelling the financial collapse, we also introduce a belief driven credit boom that increases the susceptibility of the economy to a disruptive banking panic.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a87_3ay_3a2020_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a240-288..htm,10.1093/restud/rdz032

When this happened, pogroms primarily occurred in places where Jews dominated middleman occupations, i.e., moneylending and grain trading. This evidence is inconsistent with the scapegoating hypothesis, according to which Jews were blamed for all misfortunes of the majority. Instead, the evidence is consistent with the politico-economic mechanism, in which Jewish middlemen served as providers of insurance against economic shocks to peasants and urban grain buyers in a relationship based on repeated interactions. When economic shocks occurred in times of political stability, rolling over or forgiving debts was an equilibrium outcome because both sides valued their future relationship. In contrast, during political turmoil, debtors could not commit to paying in the future, and consequently, moneylenders and grain traders had to demand immediate (re)payment. This led to ethnic violence, in which the break in the relationship between the majority and Jewish middlemen was the igniting factor.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a87_3ay_3a2020_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a289-342..htm,10.1093/restud/rdz001

We show how the returns to these investments interact with specific, measurable, and economically relevant aggregate shocks, focusing on rainfall and price fluctuations. We also obtain lower-bound estimates of confidence intervals of the returns based on estimates of the parameters of the distributions of rainfall shocks in our two agricultural samples. We find that even these lower-bound confidence intervals are substantially wider than those based solely on sampling error that are commonly provided in studies, most of which are based on single-year samples.

Using new empirical and theoretical results, I argue that each firm’s choice of how much information to acquire to set prices plays a central role in determining the patterns of pricing at the product level and the degree of aggregate price rigidity in response to shocks. In support of the information channel, I present product-level evidence that firms price goods using coarse pricing policies that are updated infrequently and consist of a small menu of prices. Firms are heterogeneous in the complexity and duration of their pricing policies, and this heterogeneity is reflected in differential responses to the Great Recession cycle, with firms exhibiting more complex policies responding more aggressively. I develop a theory of information-constrained price setting that generates coarse pricing endogenously, and quantitatively matches the discreteness, duration, and volatility of policies in the data. The information friction dampens the responsiveness of prices to shocks, and, coupled with heightened volatility, induces firms to keep prices relatively high, to protect against losses in an uncertain environment.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a87_3ay_3a2020_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a420-453..htm,10.1093/restud/rdz036

Exploring the causes of natives’ backlash, I document that immigration increased natives’ employment, spurred industrial production, and did not generate losses even among natives working in highly exposed sectors.

To raise liquidity, a seller issues a security backed by her asset in place at the price she proposes to a buyer. Before deciding whether to accept the offer, the buyer can acquire costly information about the underlying asset. This case differs from the existing literature on security design, in that the buyer has the full flexibility of choosing not only the amount of resources to spend in information acquisition, but also how to allocate them, depending on the shape of the security. Debt is shown to be the unique optimal security for the seller, as its payoff is the least sensitive to the value of its underlying asset. This minimizes the buyer’s incentive to acquire information and mitigates the resulting adverse selection. I do not assume monotonicity of the feasible securities nor impose various distributional assumptions on information structures. Instead, I identify conditions for general information costs that support the results.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a87_3ay_3a2020_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a487-536..htm,10.1093/restud/rdz035

We find strong evidence of strategic complementarities, with a typical firm adjusting its price with an elasticity of 0.4 in response to its competitors’ price changes and with an elasticity of 0.6 in response to its own cost shocks. Furthermore, we find evidence of substantial heterogeneity in these elasticities across firms. Small firms exhibit no strategic complementarities in price setting and complete cost pass-through. In contrast, large firms exhibit strong strategic complementarities, responding to both competitor price changes and their own cost shocks with roughly equal elasticities of around 0.5.

Whether more pessimistic homebuyers choose higher or lower leverage depends on their willingness and ability to reduce the size of their housing market investments. When households primarily maximize the levered return of their property investments, more pessimistic homebuyers reduce their leverage to purchase smaller houses. On the other hand, when considerations such as family size pin down the desired property size, pessimistic homebuyers reduce their financial exposure to the housing market by making smaller downpayments to buy similarly-sized homes. To determine which scenario better describes the data, we investigate the cross-sectional relationship between house price beliefs and mortgage leverage choices in the U.S. housing market. We use plausibly exogenous variation in house price beliefs to show that more pessimistic homebuyers make smaller downpayments and choose higher leverage, in particular in states where default costs are relatively low, as well as during periods when house prices are expected to fall on average.

In this setting, intervention policies that are responsive to the monitor’s message provide informative signals to the agent, which can be used to target threats efficiently. Principals that are too responsive to information shut down communication channels.

Here, rescaling transportation costs using local yields allows me to express changes in farmers’ valuations in dollars per hectare. I then use the estimated demand to infer farmers’ willingness to deforest under different counterfactual policies, such as payments to avoid deforestation and taxes on land use, along with the corresponding potential farmers’ lost surpluses. The results indicate that payment programmes and land use taxes on agricultural land can be highly effective in preserving the rainforest and also be substantially less expensive than command-and-control policies (approximately 8 times less costly).

There is a variety of economic applications where solving this problem allows to carry out inference on causal and structural parameters; a notable example is the market structure model of Ciliberto and Tamer (2009) where $p=2^{m+1}$ with $m$ being the number of firms that could possibly enter the market. We consider the test statistic given by the maximum of $p$ Studentized (or $t$-type) inequality-specific statistics, and analyse various ways to compute critical values for the test statistic. Specifically, we consider critical values based upon (1) the union bound combined with a moderate deviation inequality for self-normalized sums, (2) the multiplier and empirical bootstraps, and (3) two-step and three-step variants of (1) and (2) by incorporating the selection of uninformative inequalities that are far from being binding and a novel selection of weakly informative inequalities that are potentially binding but do not provide first-order information. We prove validity of these methods, showing that under mild conditions, they lead to tests with the error in size decreasing polynomially in $n$ while allowing for $p$ being much larger than $n$; indeed $p$ can be of order $\exp (n^{c})$ for some $c > 0$. Importantly, all these results hold without any restriction on the correlation structure between $p$ Studentized statistics, and also hold uniformly with respect to suitably large classes of underlying distributions. Moreover, in the online supplement, we show validity of a test based on the block multiplier bootstrap in the case of dependent data under some general mixing conditions.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a86_3ay_3a2019_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a1867-1900..htm,10.1093/restud/rdy065

We apply our methodology to estimate the demand and supply in the French new automobile market. Our results suggest that discounting arising from price discrimination is important. The average discount is estimated to be 9.6%, with large variation depending on buyers’ characteristics and cars’ specifications.

At each time, he posts a regular price and decides whether to hold a flash sale. Over time, buyers privately enter the market and strategically time their purchases. If a buyer does not purchase when she arrives, she can pay an attention cost to recheck the regular price afterwards, or she can wait for future flash sales where she may obtain a good at a discounted price. In the unique Markov perfect equilibrium, the seller sporadically holds flash sales to lower the stock of goods. A flash sale increases the willingness to pay of future buyers, but decreases the willingness to pay of buyers who arrive early in the game. When it is very likely that a buyer will obtain a good in a flash sale, the seller holds a “big” initial flash sale for all but one unit of the good.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a86_3ay_3a2019_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a1999-2034..htm,10.1093/restud/rdy073

We find that in all but the mosturban municipalities, allocation of larger refugee shares between electoral cycles leads to an increase in the vote share for right-leaning parties with an anti-immigration agenda, and we show large differences in voters’ responses to refugee allocation according to pre-policy municipal characteristics. However, in the largest and urban municipalities, refugee allocation has—if anything—the opposite effect on vote shares for anti-immigration parties. This coincides with a sharp divide in attitudes to refugees between urban and rural populations, which may be partly explained by distinctive interactions between natives and those with different background in cities and rural areas. Refugee allocation also has a large impact on the anti-immigration parties’ choice of where to stand for municipal election, and we provide some evidence that it influences voter turnout.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a86_3ay_3a2019_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a2035-2091..htm,10.1093/restud/rdy047

For example, someone who tries out a new restaurant while very hungry may subsequently rate it as high quality, even if the food is mediocre. We produce a simple framework for this form of attribution bias that embeds a standard model of decision making as a special case. We test for attribution bias across two consumer decisions. First, we conduct an experiment in which we randomly manipulate the thirst of participants prior to consuming a new drink. Second, using data from thousands of amusement park visitors, we explore how pleasant weather during their most recent trip affects their stated and actual likelihood of returning. In both of these domains, we find evidence that people misattribute the influence of a temporary state to a stable quality of the consumption good.

Cross-sectional differences at the time of marriage in expected wage profiles between a husband and wife strongly affect the allocation of private consumption expenditures and time use by households in the cross section. There are substantial gender asymmetries in these allocations. Even for households where the husband and wife have identical wages, the private consumption expenditures for the wife are about half those for the husband. Within a given household over time, shocks to wages lead households to shift the relative weights in favour of the spouse receiving the favourable shock. Additionally, we find that households adjust the weights in response to large but not to small shocks; the adjustment to the weights is twice as large in the year leading up to a divorce; and adjustments are more frequent in dual- than in single-earner households.

Along these two key dimensions, we find that female officers improved police quality. Crime victimization data reveal that as female representation increases among officers in an area, violent crimes against women in that area, and especially DV, are reported to the police at significantly higher rates. There are no such effects for violent crimes against men or from increases in the female share of civilian police employees. Furthermore, increases in female officer shares are followed by significant declines in rates of intimate partner homicide and non-fatal domestic abuse.

Using a unique “information experiment” embedded in an online survey, this article investigates how consumers’ home price expectations respond to past home price growth, and how they impact investment decisions. After eliciting respondents’ priors about past and future local home price changes, we present a random subset of them with factual information about past (one- or five-year) changes, and then re-elicit expectations. This unique “panel” data allows us to identify causal effects of the information, and provides insights on the expectation formation process. We find that, on average, year-ahead home price expectations are revised in a way consistent with short-term momentum in home price growth, though respondents tend to underpredict the strength of momentum. Revisions of longer-term expectations show that respondents do not expect the empirically-occurring mean reversion in home price growth. These patterns are in line with recent behavioural models of housing cycles. Finally, we show that home price expectations causally affect investment decisions in a portfolio choice experiment embedded in the survey.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a86_3ay_3a2019_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a1371-1410..htm,10.1093/restud/rdy038

To isolate the causal effect of ancestry on FDI, we build a simple reduced-form model of migrations: Migrations from a foreign country to a U.S. county at a given time depend on (1) a push factor, causing emigration from that foreign country to the entire U.S., and (2) a pull factor, causing immigration from all origins into that U.S. county. The interaction between time-series variation in origin-specific push factors and destination-specific pull factors generates quasi-random variation in the allocation of migrants across U.S. counties. We find that doubling the number of residents with ancestry from a given foreign country relative to the mean increases the probability that at least one local firm engages in FDI with that country by 4 percentage points.

We show that such discrimination is no longer optimal when the auction’s winner may resell to another bidder, and the auctioneer has non-Bayesian uncertainty about such resale opportunities. We identify a “worst-case” resale scenario, in which bidders’ values become publicly known after the auction and losing bidders compete Bertrand-style to buy the object from the winner. With this form of resale, misallocation no longer reduces the information rents of the high-value bidder, as he could still secure the same rents by buying the object in resale. Under regularity assumptions, we show that revenue is maximized by a version of the Vickrey auction with bidder-specific reserve prices, first proposed by Ausubel and Cramton (2004).

Our theory recognizes that consumers differ in their tastes for quality as well as in the information they possess about available offers, which leads to dispersion over price–quality menus in equilibrium.

We explore the cross-section of equilibrium menus and variations in market conditions to generate empirical predictions on prices, qualities, and markups across firms, and within a firm’s product line. For instance, more competition may raise prices for low-quality goods; yet, consumers are better off, as the qualities they receive also increase.

Interviews lost to duration impact individual job finding rates solely if they would have led to jobs.

We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for rationally inattentive behaviour which allow the identification of consideration sets. In simple settings, chosen options are those that are best on a stand-alone basis. In richer settings, the consideration set can only be identified holistically. In addition to payoffs, prior beliefs impact consideration sets.

We find that a first-order bias emerges when the number of included covariates is “large” relative to the square-root of sample size, rendering standard inference procedures invalid. We show that the jackknife is able to estimate this “many covariates” bias consistently, thereby delivering a new automatic bias-corrected two-step point estimator. The jackknife also consistently estimates the standard error of the original two-step point estimator. For inference, we develop a valid post-bias-correction bootstrap approximation that accounts for the additional variability introduced by the jackknife bias-correction. We find that the jackknife bias-corrected point estimator and the bootstrap post-bias-correction inference perform excellent in simulations, offering important improvements over conventional two-step point estimators and inference procedures, which are not robust to including many covariates. We apply our results to an array of distinct treatment effect, policy evaluation, and other applied microeconomics settings.

To do so, we construct and estimate a dynamic model of health investments and health insurance in which the cross-sectional health distribution evolves endogenously and is shaped by labour market and health insurance policies. A no wage discrimination law in the labour market limits the extent to which wages can depend on the health status of a worker, and a no prior conditions law outlaws higher insurance premia for individuals with worse health status. In the model, the static gains from better insurance against poor health induced by these policies are traded off against their adverse dynamic incentive effects on household efforts to lead a healthy life. In our quantitative analysis, we find that it is optimal to insure 80% of labour market-related income risk (70% if a no prior conditions law is also present). Providing full insurance is strongly suboptimal, however, since at high levels of consumption insurance, the negative dynamic incentive effects on health effort and thus the population health distribution in the long run start to dominate the short-run consumption insurance gains.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a86_3ay_3a2019_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1123-1169..htm,10.1093/restud/rdy017

Focusing on single-valued rules, we discuss the role and implications of different behavioural anchors (arbitrary level-0 play), and prove a level-$k$ revelation principle. If a function is level-$k$ implementable given any level-0 play, it must obey a slight weakening of standard strict incentive constraints. Further, the same condition is also sufficient for level-$k$ implementability, although the role of specific level-0 anchors is more controversial for the sufficiency argument.

Evidence of significant positive crime–price elasticities are shown, for a panel of 44 consumer goods and for commodity related goods (jewellery, fuel, and metal crimes). The reported evidence indicates that potential gains are a major empirical driver of criminal activity and a crucial part of the economic model of crime.

Using data from a major French platform (PriceMinister), we show descriptive evidence of substantial price dispersion among adverts for the same product, of consumers often not choosing the cheapest advert and sometimes choosing an advert dominated in price and non-price characteristics by another available advert. We consider a sequential search model where consumers sample adverts in an endogenous order based on their preferences and search costs. We show that the optimal search-and-purchase strategy can be characterized by a set of inequalities which can feasibly be tested on transaction and advert data. This allows us to estimate, for each transaction, a set of preference and search cost parameter values, thus allowing for flexible consumer heterogeneity in preferences and search costs. The estimated model can then describe a wide range of consumer search and purchase behaviours. We find that the model can explain almost all transactions in the data and requires non-zero preferences and search costs for at least 50% and 22% (respectively) of observations.

The theory is based on a matching model. Optimal public expenditure deviates from the Samuelson rule to reduce the unemployment gap (the difference between current and efficient unemployment rates). Such optimal “stimulus spending” is described by a formula expressed with three sufficient statistics: the unemployment gap, the unemployment multiplier (the decrease in unemployment achieved by increasing public expenditure), and the elasticity of substitution between public and private consumption. When unemployment is inefficiently high and the multiplier is positive, the formula yields the following results. (1) Optimal stimulus spending is positive and increasing in the unemployment gap. (2) Optimal stimulus spending is zero for a zero multiplier, increasing in the multiplier for small multipliers, largest for a moderate multiplier, and decreasing in the multiplier beyond that. (3) Optimal stimulus spending is zero if extra public goods have no value, it becomes larger as the elasticity of substitution increases, and it completely fills the unemployment gap if extra public goods are as valuable as extra private goods.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a86_3ay_3a2019_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1301-1331..htm,10.1093/restud/rdy030

It uses unique data on fertility histories of a representative sample of co-wives in Senegal to estimate a duration model of birth intervals with individual baseline hazards. Exploiting entries and exits of co-wives as well as gender of births, empirical tests show that children are strategic complements. One wife raises her fertility in response to an increase by the other wife, because children are the best claim to resources controlled by the husband. This result is the first quantitative evidence that the competition between co-wives drives fertility upwards. It suggests that polygamy undermines the fertility transition in Sub-Saharan Africa by incentivizing women to want many children.

Specifically, the presence of organized crime is associated with abnormal spikes in violence against politicians before elections—particularly when the electoral outcome is more uncertain—which in turn reduces voting for parties opposed by criminal organizations.

In the first treatment, we impose diminishing marginal returns to cash to incentivize consumption smoothing across periods. We find that subjects use the asset to smooth consumption, although the asset trades at a discount relative to the risk-neutral fundamental price. This under-pricing is a departure from the asset price “bubbles” observed in the large experimental asset pricing literature originating with Smith et al. (1988) and can be rationalized by considering subjects’ risk aversion with respect to uncertain money earnings. In a second treatment, with no induced motivation for trade à la the Smith et al. design, we find that the asset trades at a premium relative to its expected value and that shareholdings are highly concentrated. Elimination of asset price uncertainty in additional experimental treatments serves to reinforce the same observations, and suggests that speculative behaviour explains the departure of prices from fundamental value in the absence of a consumption-smoothing motive for asset trades.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a86_3ay_3a2019_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a627-667..htm,10.1093/restud/rdy035

In these areas today, both men and women continue to have more conservative attitudes towards women working, and women work fewer hours outside the home. While these women enjoy more leisure, they are also less likely to work in high-ranking occupations.

The foundation is an endogenous voter preference for a politician who is known to be non-congruent over one whose congruence is sufficiently uncertain. This preference arises because uncertainty about an elected official’s policy preferences generates policymaking distortions due to reputation/career concerns.

Conceptually, SP-L requires that an agent who regards a mechanism’s “prices” as exogenous to her report—be they traditional prices as in an auction mechanism, or price-like statistics in an assignment or matching mechanism—has a dominant strategy to report truthfully. Mathematically, SP-L weakens SP in two ways: (1) truth-telling is required to be approximately optimal (within epsilon in a large enough market) rather than exactly optimal, and (2) incentive compatibility is evaluated ex interim, with respect to all full-support i.i.d. probability distributions of play, rather than ex post with respect to all possible realizations of play. This places SP-L in between the traditional notion of approximate SP, which evaluates incentives to manipulate ex post and as a result is too strong to obtain our main results in support of SP-L, and the traditional notion of approximate Bayes-Nash incentive compatibility, which, like SP-L, evaluates incentives to manipulate ex interim, but which imposes common knowledge and strategic sophistication assumptions that are often viewed as unrealistic.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a86_3ay_3a2019_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a81-116..htm,10.1093/restud/rdy042

The primary objective of this reform was to increase the representation of women in top positions in the corporate sector and decrease the gender disparity in earnings within that sector. We document that the women appointed to these boards post-reform were observably more qualified than their female predecessors along many dimensions, and that the gender gap in earnings within boards fell substantially. However, we see no robust evidence that the reform benefited the larger set of women employed in the companies subject to the quota. Moreover, the reform had no clear impact on highly qualified women whose qualifications mirror those of board members but who were not appointed to boards. Finally, we find mixed support for the view that the reform affected the decisions of young women. While the reform was not accompanied by any change in female enrollment in business education programmes, we do see some improvements in labour market outcomes for young women with graduate business degrees in their early career stages; however, we observe similar improvements for young women with graduate science degrees, suggesting this may not be due to the reform. Overall, seven years after the board quota policy fully came into effect, we conclude that it had very little discernible impact on women in business beyond its direct effect on the women who made it into boardrooms.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a86_3ay_3a2019_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a191-239..htm,10.1093/restud/rdy032

Both types of transfers increase the demand for normal goods; in-kind transfers also increase supply in recipient communities, which could lead to lower prices than under cash transfers. We test and confirm this prediction using a programme in Mexico that randomly assigned villages to receive boxes of food (trucked into the village), equivalently-valued cash transfers, or no transfers. We find that prices are significantly lower under in-kind transfers compared to cash transfers; relative to the control group, in-kind transfers cause a 4% fall in prices while cash transfers cause a positive but negligible increase in prices. In the more economically developed villages in the sample, households’ purchasing power is only modestly affected by these price effects. In the less developed villages, the price effects are much larger in magnitude, which we show is due to these villages being less tied to the outside economy and having less competition among local suppliers.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a86_3ay_3a2019_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a240-281..htm,10.1093/restud/rdy018

This article provides experimental evidence that many people neglect the resulting double-counting problem in the updating process. In consequence, beliefs are too sensitive to the ubiquitous “telling and re-telling of stories” and exhibit excessive swings. We identify substantial and systematic heterogeneity in the presence of the bias and investigate the underlying mechanisms. The evidence points to the paramount importance of complexity in combination with people’s problems in identifying and thinking through the correlation. Even though most participants in principle have the computational skills that are necessary to develop rational beliefs, many approach the problem in a wrong way when the environment is moderately complex. Thus, experimentally nudging people’s focus towards the correlation and the underlying independent signals has large effects on beliefs.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a86_3ay_3a2019_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a313-332..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx081

We build a spatial general equilibrium framework that incorporates salient features of the U.S. state tax system, and use changes in state tax rates between 1980 and 2010 to estimate the model parameters that determine how worker and firm location respond to changes in state taxes. We find that heterogeneity in state tax rates leads to aggregate welfare losses. In terms of consumption equivalent units, harmonizing state taxes increases worker welfare by 0.6% if government spending is held constant, and by 1.2% if government spending responds endogenously. Harmonization of state taxes within Census regions achieves most of these gains.

In these settings, the asymptotic distribution of the plug-in estimator $\phi(\hat \theta_n)$ can be derived employing existing extensions to the Delta method. We show, however, that (full) differentiability of $\phi$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for bootstrap consistency whenever the limiting distribution of $\hat \theta_n$ is Gaussian. An alternative resampling scheme is proposed that remains consistent when the bootstrap fails, and is shown to provide local size control under restrictions on the directional derivative of $\phi$. These results enable us to reduce potentially challenging statistical problems to simple analytical calculations—a feature we illustrate by developing a test of whether an identified parameter belongs to a convex set.

Intermediaries require capital as they have to finance the additional amount that they can lend out of their own net worth. The net worth of financial intermediaries and the corporate sector are both state variables affecting the spread between intermediated and direct finance and the dynamics of real economic activity, such as investment, and financing. The accumulation of net worth of intermediaries is slow relative to that of the corporate sector. The model is consistent with key stylized facts about macroeconomic downturns associated with a credit crunch, namely, their severity, their protractedness, and the fact that the severity of the credit crunch itself affects the severity and persistence of downturns.

We show theoretically and suggest empirically that the effect captures free riding among workers, which originates from the way the management informs its dismissal decisions. Our study and results show that input heterogeneity and information on input quality contribute to determine the shape of incentives and have implications for human resource management, production management, and the interaction between the two.

We first develop a tractable monetary model in which households face idiosyncratic unemployment risk that they can partially self-insure using savings. A low level of liquid household wealth opens the door to self-fulfilling fluctuations: if wealth-poor households expect high unemployment, they have a strong precautionary incentive to cut spending, which can make the expectation of high unemployment a reality. Monetary policy, because of the zero lower bound, cannot rule out such expectations-driven recessions. In contrast, when wealth is sufficiently high, an aggressive monetary policy can keep the economy at full employment.

When the usage of the resources in question generates type-dependent negative externalities, the welfare comparison can become ambiguous. Both types of allocation mechanisms are being implemented in China's major cities to distribute limited vehicle licences as a measure to combat worsening traffic congestion and air pollution. While Beijing employs non-transferable lotteries, Shanghai uses an auction system. This article empirically quantifies the welfare consequences of the two mechanisms by taking into account both allocation efficiency and automobile externalities post-allocation. Our analysis shows that different allocation mechanisms lead to dramatic differences in social welfare. Although Beijing's lottery system has a large advantage in reducing automobile externalities over auction, the advantage is offset by the significant allocative cost from misallocation. The lottery system in Beijing resulted in a social welfare loss of 30 billion Yuan (nearly $5 billion) in 2012 alone. A uniform-price auction would have generated nearly 20 billion Yuan to Beijing municipal government, more than covering all its subsidies to the local public transit system.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a85_3ay_3a2018_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a2389-2428..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx067

We use the model to construct indexes of firm-level demand, marginal cost, and fixed cost. The empirical results indicate substantial firm heterogeneity in all three dimension with demand being the most dispersed. The firm-specific demand and marginal cost components account for over 30% of market share variation, 40% of sales variation, and over 50% of price variation among exporters.

Focusing on consumer under-reaction to not-fully-salient sales taxes, we show theoretically that the efficiency costs of taxation are amplified by differences in under-reaction across individuals and across tax rates. To empirically assess the importance of these issues, we implement an online shopping experiment in which 2,998 consumers purchase common household products, facing tax rates that vary in size and salience. We replicate prior findings that, on average, consumers under-react to non-salient sales taxes—consumers in our study react to existing sales taxes as if they were only 25% of their size. However, we find significant individual differences in this under-reaction, and accounting for this heterogeneity increases the efficiency cost of taxation estimates by at least 200%. Tripling existing sales tax rates nearly doubles consumers’ attention to taxes, and accounting for this endogeneity increases efficiency cost estimates by 336%. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms and determinants of boundedly rational processing of not-fully-salient incentives, and our general approach provides a framework for robust behavioural welfare analysis.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a85_3ay_3a2018_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a2462-2496..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx069

Positive public storage relaxes future participation constraints, hence it can improve risk sharing, contrary to the case where hidden income or effort is the deep friction. The characteristics of constrained-efficient allocations crucially depend on the storage technology’s return. At the steady state, if the return on storage is (i) moderately high, both assets and the consumption distribution may remain time-varying; (ii) sufficiently high, assets converge almost surely to a constant and the consumption distribution is time-invariant; (iii) equal to agents’ discount rate, perfect risk sharing is self-enforcing. Agents never have an incentive to use their private storage technology, $i.e.$ Euler inequalities are always satisfied, at the constrained-efficient allocation of our model, while this is not the case without optimal public asset accumulation. Finally, we find that, in contrast with the limited-commitment model without storage, past income affects consumption growth negatively both in our model with storage and in data from Indian villages.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a85_3ay_3a2018_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1389-1424..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx061

We refer to these episodes as stagnation traps, because they consist in the joint occurrence of a liquidity and a growth trap. In a stagnation trap, the central bank is unable to restore full employment because weak growth depresses aggregate demand and pushes the policy rate against the zero lower bound, while growth is weak because low aggregate demand results in low profits, limiting firms’ investment in innovation. Aggressive policies aiming at restoring growth, such as subsidies to investment, can successfully lead the economy out of a stagnation trap by generating a regime shift in agents’ growth expectations.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a85_3ay_3a2018_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1425-1470..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx063

His payoff is increasing in the outcome and in an observer's expectation of the outcome. With some probability, the agent will be able to disclose some information about the true outcome to the observer. We show that choice is inefficient in general. We illustrate this point with a characterization of the inefficiencies that result when the agent can perfectly disclose the outcome with some probability and can disclose nothing otherwise as in Dye (1985a). In this case, the agent favours riskier projects even with lower expected returns. On the other hand, if information can also be disclosed by a challenger who prefers lower beliefs of the observer, the chosen project is excessively risky when the agent has better access to information, excessively risk-averse when the challenger has better access, and efficient otherwise. We also characterize the agent's worst-case equilibrium payoff. We give examples of alternative disclosure technologies illustrating other forms the inefficiencies can take. For example, in a two-dimensional setting, we demonstrate a “hitting for the fences” effect where the agent systematically focuses on the “harder” dimension at the expense of success on the easier.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a85_3ay_3a2018_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1471-1501..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx064

We show that, in contrast to this view, workhorse models of consumption with incomplete markets calibrated to rich cross-sectional micro facts actually predict large consumption responses, in line with the data. To explain this result, we show that consumption responses to permanent house price shocks can be approximated by a simple and robust rule-of-thumb formula: the marginal propensity to consume out of temporary income times the value of housing. In our model, consumption responses depend on a number of factors such as the level and distribution of debt, the size and history of house price shocks, and the level of credit supply.

This practice is partly motivated by the stronger implication derived by Lee (2008), who showed that under certain conditions the distribution of baseline covariates in the RDD must be continuous at the cut-off. We propose a permutation test based on the so-called induced ordered statistics for the null hypothesis of continuity of the distribution of baseline covariates at the cut-off; and introduce a novel asymptotic framework to analyse its properties. The asymptotic framework is intended to approximate a small sample phenomenon: even though the total number $n$ of observations may be large, the number of effective observations local to the cut-off is often small. Thus, while traditional asymptotics in RDD require a growing number of observations local to the cut-off as $n\to \infty$, our framework keeps the number $q$ of observations local to the cut-off fixed as $n\to \infty$. The new test is easy to implement, asymptotically valid under weak conditions, exhibits finite sample validity under stronger conditions than those needed for its asymptotic validity, and has favourable power properties relative to tests based on means. In a simulation study, we find that the new test controls size remarkably well across designs. We then use our test to evaluate the plausibility of the design in Lee (2008), a well-known application of the RDD to study incumbency advantage.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a85_3ay_3a2018_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1577-1608..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx062

In choosing between bank and bond financing, firms trade-off the greater flexibility of banks in case of financial distress against the lower marginal costs of large bond issuances. I find that, in response to a contraction in bank credit supply, aggregate bond issuance in the corporate sector increases, but not enough to avoid a decline in aggregate borrowing and investment. Keeping leverage constant while retiring bank debt would expose firms to a higher risk of financial distress; they offset this by reducing total borrowing. A calibration of the model to the Great Recession indicates that this precautionary mechanism can account for one-third of the total decline in investment by firms with access to bond markets.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a85_3ay_3a2018_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1635-1682..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx058

In a nutshell, this term refers to the process by which even agents who are geographically far apart come to interact, thus being able to overcome what would otherwise be a fast saturation of local opportunities. A key feature of our model is that the social network is the main channel through which agents exploit new opportunities. Therefore, only if the social network becomes global (heuristically, it “reaches far in few steps”) can global interaction be steadily sustained. An important insight derived from the model is that, for the social network to turn global, the long-range links required (bridges) cannot endogenously arise unless the matching mechanism displays significant local structure (cohesion). This sheds novel light on the dichotomy between bridging and cohesion that has long played a prominent role in the socio-economic literature. Our analysis also relates the process of globalization to other features of the environment such as the quality of institutions or the arrival rate of fresh ideas.

Adjustments are heterogeneous: 4.2–26.2% of prime-aged native males change their careers; of them, some switch to white-collar careers and increase education by about three years; others reduce labour market attachment and reduce education also by about three years. These adjustments mitigate initial effects on wages and inequality. Natives that are more similar to immigrants are the most affected on impact, but also have a larger margin to adjust and differentiate.

In contrast, Lones is ambivalent if he wants the strongest conceding types of Moritz to push for acquittal. Both jurors are ambivalent with small bias or high delay costs. As Lones grows more hawkish, he argues more forcefully for convictions, mitigating wrongful acquittals. If dovish Moritz is intransigent, then he softens (strategic substitutes), leading to more wrongful convictions. Ambivalent debate is new, and yields a novel dynamic benefit of increased polarization.

To identify causal effects, we use a novel strategy that exploits discontinuities in distance to the response station across locations next to each other, but on different sides of division boundaries. Contrary to previous evidence, we find large and strongly significant effects: in our preferred estimate, a 10% increase in response time leads to a 4.7 percentage points decrease in the likelihood of clearing the crime. We find stronger effects for thefts than for violent offences, although the effects are large for every type of crime. We find suggestive evidence in support of two mechanisms: the likelihood of an immediate arrest and the likelihood that a suspect will be named by a victim or witness both increase as response time becomes faster.

This biases voters towards policy changes that create direct benefits—welfare would rise if behaviour were held constant—even if those reforms ultimately reduce welfare because people adjust behaviour. Conversely, voters are biased against policies that impose direct costs even if they induce larger indirect benefits. Using a lab experiment, we find that a majority of subjects vote against policies that, while inflicting direct costs, would help them to overcome social dilemmas and thereby increase welfare. Subjects also support policies that, while producing direct benefits, create social dilemmas and ultimately hurt welfare. Both mistakes arise because subjects fail to fully anticipate the equilibrium effects of new policies. More precisely, we establish that subjects systematically underappreciate the extent to which policy changes will affect the behaviour of other people, and that these mistaken beliefs exert a causal effect on the demand for bad policy.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a85_3ay_3a2018_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a964-998..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx031

In its basic version, a “control group” is untreated at two dates, whereas a “treatment group” becomes fully treated at the second date. However, in many applications of the DID method, the treatment rate only increases more in the treatment group. In such fuzzy designs, a popular estimator of the treatment effect is the DID of the outcome divided by the DID of the treatment. We show that this ratio identifies a local average treatment effect only if the effect of the treatment is stable over time, and if the effect of the treatment is the same in the treatment and in the control group. We then propose two alternative estimands that do not rely on any assumption on treatment effects, and that can be used when the treatment rate does not change over time in the control group. We prove that the corresponding estimators are asymptotically normal.

We examine the effect of (1) standard incentives; (2) behavioural factors like social preferences and reference dependence; and (3) non-monetary inducements from psychology. We find that (1) monetary incentives work largely as expected, including a very low piece rate treatment which does not crowd out effort; (2) the evidence is partly consistent with standard behavioural models, including warm glow, though we do not find evidence of probability weighting; (3) the psychological motivators are effective, but less so than incentives. We then compare the results to forecasts by 208 academic experts. On average, the experts anticipate several key features, like the effectiveness of psychological motivators. A sizeable share of experts, however, expects crowd-out, probability weighting, and pure altruism, counterfactually.

As in a Phelps–Lucas island model, final producers look at the prices of their local inputs to infer aggregate conditions. However, market linkages between islands make the informativeness of local prices endogenous to general equilibrium relations. In this context, I show that a vanishingly small heterogeneity in local conditions is enough to generate an equilibrium in which prices are rigid to aggregate shocks and transmit only partial information. I use this insight as a microfoundation for price rigidity in an otherwise frictionless monetary model and show that even a tiny amount of dispersion in fundamentals can lead to large non-neutrality of money.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a85_3ay_3a2018_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a1070-1110..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx043

There is uncertainty about the price distribution due to uncertainty about an underlying exogenous state of relative demand: in the high state, buyers are on the long side; otherwise, they are on the short side. In equilibrium, prices are on average higher in the high state. Individual agents learn about the distribution while searching. Agents typically start out by experimenting with a tough bargaining position—buyers may initially insist on a low price and sellers on a high price. After successive failures to trade, agents become increasingly pessimistic about the market conditions and soften their bargaining stance. When frictions are small, equilibrium transaction prices are approximately market clearing, despite aggregate demand being unknown.

Simultaneous equations models are used to study social interactions, strategic interactions between firms, and market equilibrium. Random coefficient models allow for heterogeneous marginal effects. I show that random coefficient seemingly unrelated regression models with common regressors are not point identified, which implies random coefficient simultaneous equations models are not point identified. Important features of these models, however, can be identified. For two-equation systems, I give two sets of sufficient conditions for point identification of the coefficients’ marginal distributions conditional on exogenous covariates. The first allows for small support continuous instruments under tail restrictions on the distributions of unobservables which are necessary for point identification. The second requires full support instruments, but allows for nearly arbitrary distributions of unobservables. I discuss how to generalize these results to many equation systems, where I focus on linear-in-means models with heterogeneous endogenous social interaction effects. I give sufficient conditions for point identification of the distributions of these endogenous social effects. I propose a consistent nonparametric kernel estimator for these distributions based on the identification arguments.

In my theoretical framework, taxpayers manipulate the money paid to the tax authority through avoidance and evasion activities. When taxpayers face the prospect of owing the tax authority money on tax day, loss aversion generates the perception of a greater marginal utility of tax reduction and therefore motivates greater pursuit of tax reduction activities.

To attract these workers, firms post a recruiting intensity and a hiring standard, in addition to terms of trade. A higher recruiting intensity is costly, but allows the firm to select more applicants for an interview, which reveals their productivity. The hiring standard solves the tradeoff between immediate hiring and waiting for a potentially better match in the future. I characterize equilibrium and find that various outcomes, including uniqueness of equilibrium and the cyclicality of recruiting intensity, crucially depend on firms’ recruiting cost and workers’ search cost. Calibration of the model to the U.S. labour market indicates a continuum of equilibria. Given selection of a particular equilibrium, hiring standards are countercyclical while recruiting intensity is procyclical. The calibrated model creates more amplification than a standard model without intensive margins and gives rise to procyclical match efficiency when viewed through the lens of a Cobb–Douglas matching function.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a85_3ay_3a2018_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a1314-1351..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx045

This observation has led some economists, most notably Friedrich Hayek, to conclude that recessions often reflect periods of needed liquidation resulting from past over-investment. According to the main proponents of this view, government spending or any other form of aggregate demand policy should not be used to mitigate such a liquidation process, as doing so would simply result in a needed adjustment being postponed. In contrast, ever since the work of Keynes, many economists have viewed recessions as periods of deficient demand that should be countered by activist fiscal policy. In this paper we reexamine the liquidation perspective of recessions in a setup where prices are flexible but where not all trades are coordinated by centralized markets. The model illustrates why liquidations likely cause recessions characterized by deficient aggregate demand and accordingly suggests that Keynes’ and Hayek’s views of recessions may be closely linked. In our framework, interventions aimed at stimulating aggregate demand face a trade-off whereby current stimulus postpones the adjustment process and therefore prolongs the recessions, but where some stimulative policies may nevertheless remain desirable.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a85_3ay_3a2018_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a119-156..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx008

We present two main findings. First, transaction taxes are highly distortionary across a range of margins, causing large distortions to the price, volume, and timing of property transactions. Secondly, temporary transaction tax cuts are an enormously effective form of fiscal stimulus. A temporary elimination of a 1% transaction tax increased housing market activity by 20% in the short run (due to both timing and extensive responses) and less than half of the stimulus effect was reversed after the tax was reintroduced (due to re-timing). Because of the complementarities between moving house and consumer spending, these stimulus effects translate into extra spending per dollar of tax cut equal to about 1. We interpret our empirical findings in the context of a housing model with downpayment constraints in which leverage amplifies the effects of transaction taxes.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a85_3ay_3a2018_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a157-193..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx032

The key condition that we identify is a preference reversal condition: high desired consumption today should be associated with low marginal utility at future dates.

In particular, we discuss the emergence of a deflationary safety trap equilibrium with endogenous risk premia. It is an acute form of a liquidity trap, in which the shortage of a specific form of assets, safe assets, as opposed to a general shortage of assets, is the fundamental driving force. At the Zero Lower Bound, our model has a Keynesian cross representation, in which net safe asset supply plays the role of an aggregate demand shifter. Essentially, safety traps correspond to liquidity traps in which the emergence of an endogenous risk premium significantly alters the connection between macroeconomic policy and economic activity. “Helicopter drops” of money, safe public debt issuances, swaps of private risky assets for safe public debt, or increases in the inflation target, stimulate aggregate demand and output, while forward guidance is less effective.

The second outcome involves a large volume at a depressed price. Only in the latter outcome do distressed sellers engage in fire sales, quickly unwinding their positions at a steep price discount.

For both types of externalities, we identify three sufficient statistics that determine optimal taxes on financing and investment decisions to implement constrained efficient allocations. We also show that fire sales and financial amplification are neither necessary nor sufficient to generate inefficient pecuniary externalities. We demonstrate how to employ our framework in a number of applications.

First, the identification of the marginal effect requires a measure of at least one component of risk that cannot be diversified or avoided. Moreover, measures of uninsurable wage risk must vary over time to eliminate unobserved heterogeneity. Secondly, evaluating the economic significance of risk requires knowledge of the size of all the wage risk actually faced. Existing estimates are problematic because measures of wage risk fail to satisfy the “non-avoidability” requirement. This creates a downward bias, which is at the root of the small estimated effect of wage risk on portfolio choices. To tackle this problem we match panel data of workers and firms and use the variability in the profitability of the firm that is passed over to workers to obtain a measure of uninsurable risk. Using this measure to instrument total variability in individual earnings, we find that the marginal effect of uninsurable wage risk is much larger than estimates that ignore endogeneity. We bound the economic impact of risk and find that its overall effect is contained, not because its marginal effect is small but because its size is small. And the size of uninsurable wage risk is small because firms provide substantial wage insurance.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a85_3ay_3a2018_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a437-474..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx023

Export zeros arise because some northern firms abstain from exporting to the South, to avoid international arbitrage. Rich countries benefit from a trade liberalization, while poor countries lose.

At the optimum, income taxes balance the marginal losses from inter-sector migration with the marginal gains from tailoring tax schedules to the distribution of productivities in each sector (“tagging”). A calibrated model indicates that sector-specific taxation generates substantive welfare gains when skill transferability decreases with income, as it enables the government to increase average taxes on high earners with large wage premia.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a85_3ay_3a2018_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a511-557..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx022

Despite the large number of different applications, these games have not been studied in any systematic way. We identify and study a general class of such games, which we call “endogenous signalling games”. These games normally suffer from a plethora of equilibria. To focus on reasonable equilibria, we propose to solve such games by requiring that the solution be invariant to a particular reordering of the senders’ moves. For a class of single-sender monotone endogenous signalling games, we show that the sender’s private choice can still have some commitment value even though it is not observed and that the sender’s signals must be exaggerated in equilibrium. Applications to loss-leader pricing, costly announcements, limit pricing, advertising, corporate financing, and private contracting are given.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a85_3ay_3a2018_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a558-580..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx012

This article develops new tools to address such issues and illustrates their usefulness in applications. The central development is a condition called quasi-concave differences, which implies concavity of the policy function in optimization problems without imposing differentiability or quasi-concavity conditions. The general take-away is that many distributional questions in economics which cannot be solved by direct calculations or the implicit function theorem, can be addressed easily with this article’s methods. Several applications demonstrate this: the article shows how increased uncertainty affects the set of equilibria in Bayesian games; it shows how increased dispersion of productivities affects output in the model of Melitz (2003); and it generalizes Carroll and Kimball (1996)’s result on concave consumption functions to the Aiyagari (1994) setting with borrowing constraints.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a85_3ay_3a2018_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a581-610..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx021

Traders agree to disagree about the precisions of their continuous flows of Gaussian private information. The price depends on a trader’s inventory (permanent price impact) and the derivative of a trader’s inventory (temporary price impact). More disagreement makes the market more liquid; without enough disagreement, there is no trade. Target inventories mean-revert at the same rate as private signals. Actual inventories smoothly adjust towards target inventories at an endogenous rate which increases with disagreement. Faster-than-equilibrium trading generates “flash crashes” by increasing temporary price impact.

First, persistent natural amenities anchor neighbourhoods to high incomes over time. Secondly, naturally heterogeneous cities exhibit persistent spatial distributions of income.

We test for bias by examining movie reviews in media outlets owned by News Corp, such as the Wall Street Journal, and Time Warner, such as Time. We find higher ratings for 20th Century Fox movies in News Corp. outlets compared to movies by other studios. To disentangle bias from correlation of taste, we introduce and validate a novel matching procedure using individual movie ratings from online platforms. Using this procedure, we find no evidence of bias in News Corp. nor Time Warner outlets. We reject even small effects, such as bias of one extra star (out of four) every thirteen movies. We test for differential bias when the return to bias is plausibly higher, examine bias by media outlet and by journalist, as well as editorial bias. We also consider bias by omission—whether media outlets are more likely to review highly-rated movies by affiliated studios—and conflict of interest within a movie aggregator. In none of these dimensions do we find evidence of bias. We relate to previous work and discuss three explanations for the lack of bias in our setting: high values of media reputation, organizational features in a conglomerate, and low returns to bias.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a84_3ay_3a2017_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a1510-1550..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx002

Two hypotheses may explain such specialization, with different implications for welfare, inequality, and trade policy. Fajgelbaum et al. formalize the Linder hypothesis that home demand determines the pattern of specialization and, therefore, predict that high-income locations export high-quality products. The factor-proportions model also predicts that skill-abundant, high-income locations export skill-intensive, high-quality products. Prior empirical evidence does not separate these explanations. I develop a model that nests both hypotheses and employ microdata on U.S. manufacturing plants’ shipments and factor inputs to quantify the two mechanisms’ roles in quality specialization across U.S. cities.

A Statistical Decision Problem,"['Jeff Dominitz', 'Charles Manski']","2017, vol. 84, issue 4, 1583-1605","['C44', 'C83']","Abstract: When designing data collection, crucial questions arise regarding how much data to collect and how much effort to expend to enhance the quality of the collected data. To make choice of sample design a coherent subject of study, it is desirable to specify an explicit decision problem. We use the Wald framework of statistical decision theory to study allocation of a budget between two or more sampling processes. These processes all draw random samples from a population of interest and aim to collect data that are informative about the sample realizations of an outcome. They differ in the cost of data collection and the quality of the data obtained. One may incur lower cost per sample member but yield lower data quality than another. Increasing the allocation of budget to a low-cost process yields more data, while increasing the allocation to a high-cost process yields better data. We initially view the concept of “better data” abstractly and then fix attention on two important cases. In both cases, a high-cost sampling process accurately measures the outcome of each sample member. The cases differ in the data yielded by a low-cost process. In one, the low-cost process has non-response and in the other it provides a low-resolution interval measure of each sample member’s outcome. In these settings, we study minimax-regret sample design for prediction of a real-valued outcome under square loss; that is, design which minimizes maximum mean square error. The analysis imposes no assumptions that restrict the unobserved outcomes. Hence, the decision maker must cope with both the statistical imprecision of finite samples and the partial identification of the true state of nature.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a84_3ay_3a2017_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a1583-1605..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx005

We build and solve a dynamic model of sequential double auctions in which traders trade strategically with demand schedules. Trading needs are generated by time-varying private information about the asset value and private values for owning the asset, as well as quadratic inventory costs. We characterize a linear equilibrium with stationary strategies and its efficiency properties in closed form. Frequent trading (more double auctions per unit of time) allows more immediate asset reallocation after new information arrives, at the cost of a lower volume of beneficial trades in each double auction. Under stated conditions, the trading frequency that maximizes allocative efficiency coincides with the information arrival frequency for scheduled information releases, but can far exceed the information arrival frequency if new information arrives stochastically. A simple calibration of the model suggests that a moderate market slowdown to the level of seconds or minutes per double auction can improve allocative efficiency for assets with relatively narrow investor participation and relatively infrequent news, such as small- and micro-cap stocks.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a84_3ay_3a2017_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a1606-1651..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx006

Without an active regulator, firms self-regulate to preempt or end a boycott and private politics is beneficial for activists but harmful for firms. With an active regulator, in contrast, firms self-regulate to preempt public regulation and private politics is harmful for activists but beneficial for firms.

When property rights are instead weak and extraction is illegal or costly control, conservation in one district increases the price and thus the profit from illegally depleting the resource in the other districts. The externality from conservation is then negative, and centralization would lead to less conservation.

This property is in sharp contrast to the strongly procyclical participation predicted by both neoclassical models and models with search frictions, when we assume bachelor households or households with infinitely many members (complete markets). In the two-member household model and in the data, primary earners are always in the labour force, secondary earners have a mildly countercyclical participation rate, and a mildly procyclical employment rate.

This results in contractual externalities when these aggregate variables are used as benchmarks in contracts. Contractual externalities have welfare changing effects when principals put too much weight on APE or RPE due to information frictions. Relative to the second best, if the expected productivity is high, risk-averse principals over-incentivize their own agents, triggering a rat race in effort exertion, resulting in over-investment in effort and excessive exposure to industry risks.

This article studies an economy in which an inequality-averse social planner faces agents who have access to a tax-avoidance technology with subadditive costs, and who can shape the risk profile of their income as they see fit. Subadditive avoidance costs imply that optimal taxation cannot be progressive at the top. This in turn may trigger excessive risk-taking. When the avoidance technology consists in costly migration between two countries that compete fiscally, we show that an endogenous increase in inequality due to risk-taking makes progressive taxation more fragile, which vindicates in turn risk-taking and can lead to equilibria with regressive tax rates at the top, and high migrations of wealth towards the smaller country.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a84_3ay_3a2017_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1186-1209..htm,10.1093/restud/rdw033

Identification comes from an exceptional policy introduced in the city of Maastricht in the Netherlands that discriminated access via licensed cannabis shops based on an individual’s nationality. We apply a difference-in-difference approach using administrative panel data on course grades of local students enrolled at Maastricht University before and during the partial cannabis prohibition. We find that the academic performance of students who are no longer legally permitted to buy cannabis substantially increases. Grade improvements are driven by younger students and the effects are stronger for women and low performers. In line with how cannabis consumption affects cognitive functioning, we find that performance gains are larger for courses that require more numerical/mathematical skills. Our investigation of underlying channels using course evaluations suggests that performance gains are driven by an improved understanding of the material rather than changes in students’ study effort.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a84_3ay_3a2017_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1210-1237..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx020

First, it considers a frequency domain expression for the Kullback–Leibler distance between two DSGE models and shows that global identification fails if and only if the minimized distance equals 0. This result has three features: (1) it can be applied across DSGE models with different structures; (2) it permits checking whether a subset of frequencies can deliver identification; (3) it delivers parameter values that yield observational equivalence if there is identification failure. Next, the article proposes a measure for the empirical closeness between two DSGE models for a further understanding of the strength of identification. The measure gauges the feasibility of distinguishing one model from another based on a finite number of observations generated by the two models. It is shown to represent the highest possible power under Gaussianity when considering local alternatives. The above theory is illustrated using two small-scale and one medium-scale DSGE models. The results document that certain parameters can be identified under indeterminacy but not determinacy, that different monetary policy rules can be (nearly) observationally equivalent, and that identification properties can differ substantially between small and medium-scale models. For implementation, two procedures are developed and made available, both of which can be used to obtain and thus to cross validate the findings reported in the empirical applications. Although the article focuses on DSGE models, the results are also applicable to other vector linear processes with well-defined spectra, such as the (factor-augmented) vector autoregression.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a84_3ay_3a2017_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1306-1345..htm,10.1093/restud/rdw048

This result holds regardless of whether the provision increases the decider’s payoff or not. Intriguingly, it is not only selfish or maximin types who provide the good. Rather, we show that a substantial fraction of subjects are “insensitive to group size”: they reveal to care about the payoff of all parties, but attach the same weight to small and large groups so that they ignore large provision costs that are dispersed among many payers.

We find that entry barriers and monopoly power in the non-agricultural sector were the most important reason for Tsarist Russia’s failure to industrialize before World War I. Soviet industrial transformation after 1928 was achieved primarily by reducing such frictions, albeit coinciding with a significantly lower performance of productivity in both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors.

Using new data on U.S. firms’ decisions to contract for manufacturing services from domestic or foreign suppliers, I show that a firm’s adoption of communication technology between 2002 and 2007 is associated with a 3.1 point increase in its probability of fragmentation. The effect of firm technology also differs significantly across industries; in 2007, it is 20% higher, relative to the mean, in industries with production specifications that are easier to codify in an electronic format. These patterns suggest that technology lowers coordination costs, though its effect is disproportionately higher for domestic rather than foreign sourcing. The larger impact on domestic fragmentation highlights its importance as an alternative to offshoring, and can be explained by complementarities between technology and worker skill. High technology firms and industries are more likely to source from high human capital countries, and the differential impact of technology across industries is strongly increasing in country human capital.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a84_3ay_3a2017_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a650-687..htm,10.1093/restud/rdw057

Workers differ in manual and cognitive skills and sort into jobs that demand different combinations of these two skills. To study this multidimensional sorting problem, I develop a theoretical framework that generalizes the unidimensional notion of assortative matching and sufficient conditions on the technology under which sorting obtains. I derive the equilibrium in closed form and use this explicit solution to study biased technological change. The main finding is that an increase in worker-job complementarities in cognitive relative to manual inputs leads to more pronounced sorting and wage inequality across cognitive relative to manual skills. This can trigger wage polarization and boost aggregate wage inequality. I then estimate the model for the U.S. and identify sizable technology shifts: during the last two decades, worker-job complementarities in cognitive inputs strongly increased, whereas complementarities in manual inputs decreased. In addition to this bias in complementarities, there has been a cognitive skill-bias in production. Counterfactual exercises suggest that these technology shifts (as opposed to changes in skill supply and demand) can account for observed changes in worker-job sorting, wage polarization and a significant part of the increase in U.S. wage dispersion.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a84_3ay_3a2017_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a718-789..htm,10.1093/restud/rdw063

The seller is privately informed on his persistent cost, while the buyer remains uninformed. Public enforcement relies on remedies for breaches. Private enforcement comes from terminating the relationship. We first characterize enforcement constraints under asymmetric information. Those constraints ensure that parties never breach contracts. In particular, a high-cost seller may be tempted to trade high volumes at high prices at the beginning of the relationship before breaching the contract later on. Such “take-the-money-and-run” strategy becomes less attractive as time passes. It can thus be prevented by backloading payments and increasing volumes over a transitory phase. In a mature phase, enforcement constraints are slack and the optimal contract, although keeping memory of the shadow cost of enforcement constraints binding earlier on, looks stationary. Second-best distortions depend on a modified virtual cost that encapsulates this shadow cost of enforcement.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a84_3ay_3a2017_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a816-852..htm,10.1093/restud/rdw024

First, loss aversion explains excess smoothness and sensitivity—that is, the empirical observation that consumption responds to income shocks with a lag. Intuitively, such lagged responses allow the agent to delay painful losses in consumption until his expectations have adjusted. Secondly, the preferences generate a hump-shaped consumption profile. Early in life, consumption is low due to a first-order precautionary-savings motive. However, as uncertainty resolves over time, this motive is dominated by time-inconsistent overconsumption that eventually leads to declining consumption towards the end of life. Thirdly, consumption drops at retirement. Prior to retirement, the agent wants to overconsume his uncertain income before his expectations catch up. Post-retirement, however, income is no longer uncertain, and overconsumption is associated with a sure loss in future consumption. As an empirical contribution, I structurally estimate the preference parameters using life-cycle consumption data. My estimates match those obtained in experiments and other micro studies, and generate the degree of excess smoothness observed in macro consumption data.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a84_3ay_3a2017_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a885-934..htm,10.1093/restud/rdx003

The pecuniary externality induces agents to put too much weight on private information and in the standard case, when the allocation role of the price prevails over its informational role, overwhelms the learning externality which impinges in the opposite way. The price may be very informative but at the cost of an excessive dispersion of the actions of agents.

Because insurance coverage is typically determined by the treatment date, individuals may have incentives to strategically delay treatments to minimize out-of-pocket costs.

This article investigates these forces empirically in the context of the missing market for dental insurance. Using rich claim-level data, my analysis reveals that approximately 40% of individuals strategically delay dental treatments when incentivized to do so, and this flexibility in delaying treatment can explain why the market for dental insurance has largely unraveled.

With learning, shirking by the agent both reduces output and lowers the principal’s estimate of future profitability. The agent can exploit this belief discrepancy and earn information rents, reducing his incentives to exert effort. The optimal contract controls information rents to improve incentives by distorting the termination decision. Our results capture the transition from a young, financially constrained firm to a mature firm that pays dividends. For young firms, poor performance permanently raises the termination threshold, as doing so lowers information rents. Mature firms pay smoothed dividends and have a fixed termination threshold. Dividend smoothing occurs because earnings surprises are used to adjust financial slack in line with profitability. When profitability only reflects the agent’s private ability, a simple equity contract is optimal.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a84_3ay_3a2017_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a182-236..htm,10.1093/restud/rdw029

Panel data on water pollution in Brazilian rivers coupled with county splits that change the locations of borders allow us to identify the spatial patterns of pollution as rivers approach and cross borders, controlling for fixed effects and trends specific to each location. The theory of externalities predicts that pollution should increase at an increasing rate as the river approaches the downstream exit border, that there should be a structural break in the slope of the pollution function at the border, and that a larger number of managing jurisdictions should exacerbate pollution externalities. We find support for all four predictions in the data.

Unlike standard models of strategic thinking, in this framework the player's ""depth of reasoning"" is endogenously determined, and it can be disentangled from his beliefs over his opponent's cognitive bound. In our approach, individuals act as if they follow a cost–benefit analysis. The depth of reasoning is a function of the player's cognitive abilities and his payoffs. The costs are exogenous and represent the game-theoretical sophistication of the player; the benefit instead is related to the game payoffs. Behaviour is in turn determined by the individual's depth of reasoning and his beliefs about the reasoning process of the opponent. Thus, in our framework, payoffs not only affect individual choices in the traditional sense, but they also shape the cognitive process itself. Our model delivers testable implications on players' chosen actions as incentives and opponents change. We then test the model's predictions with an experiment. We administer different treatments that vary beliefs over payoffs and opponents, as well as beliefs over opponents' beliefs. The results of this experiment, which are not accounted for by current models of reasoning in games, strongly support our theory. We also show that the predictions of our model are highly consistent, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with well-known unresolved empirical puzzles. Our approach therefore serves as a novel, unifying framework of strategic thinking that allows for predictions across games.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a83_3ay_3a2016_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a1297-1333..htm,10.1093/restud/rdv052

Unsecured credit rests on the value that borrowers attach to a good credit reputation which is a forward-looking variable. We argue that self-fulfilling beliefs over future credit conditions naturally generate endogenously persistent business-cycle dynamics.

For a public good that comes as a single indivisible unit the outcome depends on whether or not the share of votes in favour of provision exceeds a specified threshold.

Sequential voting minimizes vote splitting in late districts, but voters may coordinate on a low-quality candidate.

To evaluate this story, we develop a simple model that incorporates two key frictions: asymmetric information about borrowers' risk of default and a fixed cost of developing each contract lenders offer. Innovations that ameliorate asymmetric information or reduce this fixed cost have large extensive margin effects via the entry of new lending contracts targeted at riskier borrowers. This results in more defaults and borrowing, and increased dispersion of interest rates. Using the Survey of Consumer Finances and Federal Reserve Board interest rate data, we find evidence supporting these predictions. Specifically, the dispersion of credit card interest rates nearly tripled while the ""new"" cardholders of the late 1980s and 1990s had riskier observable characteristics than existing cardholders.

In order to accommodate substantial heterogeneity (both observed and unobserved) across agents and markets, the article first develops a general framework for estimating and solving dynamic discrete choice models in continuous time that is computationally light and readily applicable to dynamic games. In the proposed framework, players face a standard dynamic discrete choice problem at decision times that occur stochastically. The resulting stochastic-sequential structure naturally admits the use of conditional choice probability methods for estimation and makes it possible to compute counterfactual simulations for relatively high-dimensional games. The model and method are applied to the retail grocery industry, into which Walmart began rapidly expanding in the early 1990s, eventually attaining a dominant position. We find that Walmart's expansion into groceries came mostly at the expense of the large incumbent supermarket chains, rather than the single-store outlets that bore the brunt of its earlier conquest of the broader general merchandise sector.

This article explores how electoral rules, such as district magnitude, mediate this trade-off and affect the composition of representative bodies and the quality of policy outcomes. We show formally that anticipation of bargaining over policy causes voters in elections with multiple single-member districts to prefer candidates with polarized policy positions over more competent candidates. Results from a unique field experiment in Afghanistan are consistent with these predictions.

When trading ceases in equilibrium as a response to an adverse shock to asset quality, a government can resurrect trading by buying up lemons which involves a financial loss. The optimal policy is centred around an announcement effect where trading starts already before the intervention for two reasons. First, delaying the intervention allows selling pressure to build up thereby improving the average quality of assets for sale. Secondly, intervening at a higher price increases the return from buying an asset of unknown quality. It is optimal to intervene immediately at the lowest price when the market is sufficiently important. For less important markets, when the shock to quality and search frictions are small, it is optimal to rely on the announcement effect.

This article shows that price rigidity can alternatively reflect optimal price setting when there are no adjustment costs, namely, if the seller is rationally inattentive. The model generates non-trivial pricing patterns that are consistent with the data and that are hard to explain with the traditional adjustment-cost model.

We characterize Pareto optimal income taxes that do not condition on how much of an individual's income is earned in each of the two activities. These optimal taxes feature an externality-corrective term, the magnitude of which depends both on the Pigouvian correction that would obtain if rent-seeking incomes could be perfectly targeted and on the relative impact of rent-seeking externalities on the private returns to traditional and to rent-seeking activities. If rent-seeking externalities primarily affect other rent-seekers, for example, the optimal correction lies strictly below the Pigouvian correction. A calibrated model indicates that the gap between the Pigouvian and optimal correction can be quantitatively important. Our results thus point to a hefty informational requirement for correcting rent-seeking externalities through the income tax code.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a83_3ay_3a2016_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1225-1262..htm,10.1093/restud/rdw017

Previous work on rational inattentiveness has allowed for observation intervals that are either constant-but-long (e.g. Caballero, 1989 or Reis, 2006) or volatile-but-short (e.g. Reis's, 2006 example where observation costs are negligible), but not both. In these models, the real effects of monetary policy are small for realistic values of the duration between observations.

In either case, we find that all consistent equilibria of the contracting game are efficient in the case of two players. But if participation is voluntary, and there are more than two players, there are situations in which all consistent equilibria are inefficient. Specifically, the provision of public goods tends to be inefficiently low due to strategic abstention from contracting.

A common finding is that potential donors give less when there is greater risk that their donation will have less impact. While this behaviour could be fully rationalized by standard economic models, this article shows that an additional mechanism is relevant: the use of risk as an excuse not to give. In a laboratory study, participants evaluate risky payoffs for themselves and risky payoffs for a charity. When their decisions do not involve tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, they respond very similarly to self risk and charity risk. By contrast, when their decisions force tradeoffs between money for themselves and the charity, participants act more averse to charity risk and less averse to self risk. These altered responses to risk bias participants towards choosing payoffs for themselves more often, consistent with excuse-driven responses to risk.

Formal contracts are enforced by third-party institutions (courts), whereas relational contracts are self-enforcing agreements without third-party involvement. The novel feature of our model is that it demonstrates the co-evolution of these different enforcement modes and market equilibrium conditions, all of which are jointly determined.

We propose a fast and robust generalization of backward induction we call state recursion that operates on a decomposition of the overall DDG into a finite number of more tractable stage games, which can be solved recursively. We provide conditions under which state recursion finds at least one MPE of the overall DDG and introduce a recursive lexicographic search (RLS) algorithm that systematically and efficiently uses state recursion to find all MPE of the overall game in a finite number of steps. We apply RLS to find all MPE of a dynamic model of Bertrand price competition with cost-reducing investments which we show is a DDG. We provide an exact non-iterative algorithm that finds all MPE of every stage game, and prove there can be only 1, 3, or 5 of them. Using the stage games as building blocks, RLS rapidly finds and enumerates all MPE of the overall game. RLS finds a unique MPE for an alternating move version of the leapfrogging game when technology improves with probability 1, but in other cases, and in any simultaneous move version of the game, it finds a huge multiplicity of MPE that explode exponentially as the number of possible cost states increases.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a83_3ay_3a2016_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a658-703..htm,10.1093/restud/rdv046

We show experimentally that freedom of neighbourhood choice overcomes the problem and leads to fully efficient coordination. This implies substantial welfare effects with achieved welfare being about 50% higher in games with neighbourhood choice than without it. We identify exclusion of low effort providers who in response start providing high effort as the simple but effective mechanism enforcing efficient coordination. A variety of other treatments show that the efficiency result as well as the identified mechanism are robust to changes in the information condition, payoff specification, and a substantial increase in group size. Moreover, we find that neighbourhood choice boosts efficiency even when exclusion does not materially affect the excluded agent.

Excess airplane idling, measured as residual daily taxi time, is due to network delays originating in the Eastern US.

We first show that vertical integration generates ex ante incentives to create hold-up problems: an integrated supplier is willing to pre-commit itself to appropriating or dissipating part of its customer's profits, to expose the independent rival to being held-up by the other supplier, and discourage in this way the rival's investment. We then show that, even in the absence of any pre-commitment, vertical integration also creates hold-up problems ex post when degrading the quality of the support provided to one downstream firm benefits its rival.

These within and between effects were about equal in magnitude, and account for 14% of European technology upgrading over 2000–7 (and even more when we allow for offshoring to China). Rising Chinese import competition also led to falls in employment and the share of unskilled workers.

Subjective expectations, in particular about mortality risk but not the risk of living with HIV, play an important role in determining the decision to have multiple sexual partners. Using our estimated parameters, we simulate the impact of various policies that would influence expectations. An information campaign on mortality risk would decrease risky sexual behaviour on average, whereas an information campaign on HIV transmission risks, which tend to be overestimated by respondents, would actually increase risky behaviour. Also, the expansion of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) treatments to all individuals infected with HIV would increase risky sexual behaviour for a quarter of the HIV-negative individuals or those who have not been tested because they are aware that ART increases life expectancy, and thus reduces the cost of becoming HIV positive.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a83_3ay_3a2016_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a118-164..htm,10.1093/restud/rdv028

Are the availability and use of such information beneficial or detrimental to consumer surplus? We develop a model in which a monopoly sells a network good and price discriminates based on information about consumers' influence and consumers' susceptibility to influence. The monopoly optimally offers consumers price discounts for their influence and charges price premia for their susceptibility; the price premia and the price discounts are simple functions of the pattern of network effects. We determine under which conditions, relative to uniform price, consumer surplus increases, and we characterize the value of information on network effects for the monopoly.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a83_3ay_3a2016_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a165-198..htm,10.1093/restud/rdv032

Parameter estimates suggest that women anticipate that observable income will be ""taxed"" at a rate above 4%; this effective tax rate nearly doubles when kin can observe income directly.

When agents know their preferences at all states, the competitive equilibrium can be supported as a Nash equilibrium of the market game, that is, agents behave as if they were price takers. Therefore, if the associated competitive economy has a fully revealing rational expectations equilibrium, then so does the market game. This resolves the puzzle that agents behave as if prices were given, even though prices aggregate private information, at least for this ""private values"" case. Necessary conditions for Nash equilibrium show that the resulting allocation cannot deviate too far from a competitive equilibrium.

Before 1960, children from larger families obtained more education, in large part because they had richer and more educated parents. By century's end, these patterns had reversed. Consequently, fertility differentials by income and education historically raised the average education of the next generation, but they now reduce it. Relative to the level of average education, the positive effect of differential fertility in the past exceeded its negative effect in the present. While the reversal of differential fertility is unrelated to changes in GDP per capita, women's work, sectoral composition, or health, roughly half is attributable to rising aggregate education in the parents' generation. The data are consistent with a model in which fertility has a hump-shaped relationship with parental skill, due to a corner solution in which low-skill parents forgo investment in their children.

Corporate prediction markets face additional issues, such as thinness, weak incentives, limited entry, and the potential for traders with biases or ulterior motives—raising questions about how well these markets will perform. We examine data from prediction markets run by Google, Ford Motor Company, and an anonymous basic materials conglomerate (Firm X). Despite theoretically adverse conditions, we find these markets are relatively efficient, and improve upon the forecasts of experts at all three firms by as much as a 25% reduction in mean-squared error. The most notable inefficiency is an optimism bias in the markets at Google. The inefficiencies that do exist generally become smaller over time.

The connections–mortality relationship is attenuated in provinces where safety regulators' promotion is contingent on meeting safety targets. In the absence of fatalities, connected firms receive fewer reports of major violations for safety compliance, whereas in years of fatal accidents the rate of reported violations is identical. Moreover, fatal accidents produce negative returns at connected companies and are associated with the subsequent departure of well-connected executives. These results provide suggestive evidence that connections enable firms to avoid (potentially costly) compliance measures, rather than using connections to avoid regulatory response after accidents occur. Our findings emphasize the social costs of political connections, and suggest that appropriate regulatory incentives may be useful in mitigating these costs.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a82_3ay_3a2015_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a1346-1382..htm,10.1093/restud/rdv020

Prior research has emphasized a negative relation between productivity and equity risk that results from operating leverage when capital adjustment is costly. In general, however, expansion and contraction options affect risk in the opposite direction: they lower equity risk as profitability declines. The general prediction is a non-monotonic overlay of opposing real option and operating leverage effects. For parameters chosen to match empirical firm characteristics, the predicted non-monotonicities are quantitatively important, and are detectable in the data. The calibrated model implies that real option effects dominate operating leverage effects, and the average firm is best described by an increasing risk profile, a conclusion supported by conditional beta estimates. The baseline calibration helps explain the profitability premium in the cross-section, but makes the value puzzle worse.

By using recommendation strategies that do not reveal that one player is weak to a strong opponent, a mediator can effectively circumvent the unenforceability constraint. This is because these strategies make the strong player agree to recommendations that yield the same payoff as arbitration in expectation.

I find that doubling a destination's per capita income results in an 18% increase in the price of identical items sold there. Per capita income differences account for a third, whereas shipping cost differences can explain up to a third of the cross-country price variations of identical items purchased via the Internet by consumers who do not take advantage of quantity discounts.

The model provides a number of quite different predictions. (i) From a positive perspective, the key distinction turns on whether the quota is less than unanimity. In that case, patient enough players waste substantial shares of the pie each period and the size principle fails in some pure strategy Markov perfect equilibria.

The method is explicitly designed to handle dynamics in the data, and yields estimators that are straightforward to implement and can be readily applied to a range of models and estimands.

We develop a quantitative dynamic general equilibrium model with endogenous fertility and female labour force participation decisions. We use the model to assess the impact of the war on female labour supply and fertility in the decades following the war. For the war generation of women, the high demand for female labour brought about by mobilization leads to an increase in labour supply that persists after the war. As a result, younger women who reach adulthood in the 1950s face increased labour market competition, which impels them to exit the labour market and start having children earlier. The effect is amplified by the rise in taxes necessary to pay down wartime government debt.

The PMH model has hidden actions, while the HMH model has hidden information in addition to hidden actions. In both models, agents are risk averse and principals are risk neutral. The article derives the equilibrium restrictions from the optimal contract and uses the restrictions to show that the models have empirical content. For any given risk-aversion parameter, the models' other parameters are non-parametrically point identified. The risk-aversion parameter—and hence the model—are, however, only partially identified. Management's ability to manipulate accounting reports arises endogenously within HMH models, but not in all versions of PMH models. We use our framework to investigate whether shareholders contract with management recognizing that accounting reports are susceptible to manipulation and, therefore, endogenous to the incentives offered to management. The data reject all models in which accounting reports are verifiable. Furthermore, the version of the PMH in which accounting reports can be manipulated is rejected if expected compensation is restricted to be positive.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a82_3ay_3a2015_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1074-1118..htm,10.1093/restud/rdv004

The article studies the dynamics induced by an increase in financial openness. It shows that the relative size of the non-tradable sector overshoots, which makes the economy more likely to be financially fragile during the transitory dynamics.

We then prove the bound to be tight under certain conditions on the designer's prior over the agents' pay-off types in auction and bilateral-trade applications. In private-value auction and bilateral trade, the optimal mechanisms (a second-price auction and posted-price mechanism, respectively) satisfy dominant-strategy incentive compatibility, the classical notion of ""robust"" mechanisms.

For sufficiently backward-looking societies, history completely drives equilibrium play, leading to a social norm of high or low cooperation. In more forward-looking societies, there is a pattern of “reversion” whereby play starting with high (low) cooperation reverts towards lower (higher) cooperation.

Adding a rival hospital increases management quality by 0.4 standard deviations and increases survival rates from emergency heart attacks by 9.7%.

The model thus generates dispersion in wages, productivity and human resource strategies, and gives rise to endogenous job ladders.

The data are qualitatively consistent with the theory, as subjects mimic induced types.

However, there are quantitative deviations from the theory: subjects make aggressive demands too often and participate in longer conflicts before reaching agreements.

Exceptions to this pattern of two-sided selection are occupations with steeply rising (declining) productivity, where mainly the lower (higher) paid workers within this occupation tend to leave.

Telmer']","2015, vol. 82, issue 2, 693-735",[],"Abstract: We propose a new methodology for measuring intergenerational mobility in economic well-being. Our method is based on the joint distribution of surnames and economic outcomes. It circumvents the need for intergenerational panel data, a long-standing stumbling block for understanding mobility. It does so by using cross-sectional data alongside a calibrated structural model to recover the traditional intergenerational elasticity measures. Our main idea is simple. If “inheritance” is important for economic outcomes, then rare surnames should predict economic outcomes in the cross-section. This is because rare surnames are indicative of familial linkages. If the number of rare surnames is small this approach will not work. However, rare surnames are abundant in the highly skewed nature of surname distributions from most Western societies. We develop a model that articulates this idea and shows that the more important is inheritance, the more informative will be surnames. This result is robust to a variety of different assumptions about fertility and mating. We apply our method using the 2001 census from Catalonia, a large region of Spain. We use educational attainment as a proxy for overall economic well-being. A calibration exercise results in an estimate of the intergenerational correlation of educational attainment of 0.60. We also find evidence suggesting that mobility has decreased among the different generations of the 20th century. A complementary analysis based on sibling correlations confirms our results and provides a robustness check on our method. Our model and our data allow us to examine one possible explanation for the observed decrease in mobility. We find that the degree of assortative mating has increased over time. Overall, we argue that our method has promise because it can tap the vast mines of census data that are available in a heretofore unexploited manner.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a82_3ay_3a2015_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a693-735.htm,10.1093/restud/rdu041

Whether, and to what extent, gender differences in attitudes toward competition lead to differences in naturally occurring labour markets remains an open question. To examine this, we run a natural field experiment on job-entry decisions where we randomize almost 9000 job-seekers into different compensation regimes. By varying the role that individual competition plays in setting the wage and the gender composition, we examine whether a competitive compensation regime, by itself, can cause differential job entry. The data highlight the power of the compensation regime in that women disproportionately shy away from competitive work settings. Yet, there are important factors that attenuate the gender differences, including whether the job is performed in teams, whether the position has overt gender associations, and the age of the job-seekers. We also find that the effect is most pronounced in labour markets with attractive alternative employment options.

When inattentive consumers are sophisticated but heterogeneous in their expected demand, bill-shock regulation reduces social welfare in fairly-competitive markets, which may be the effect of the Federal Communication Commission's recent bill-shock agreement. If some consumers are attentive while others naively fail to anticipate their own inattention, however, then bill-shock regulation increases social welfare and can benefit consumers. Hence, requiring zero-balance alerts in addition to the Federal Reserve's new opt-in rule for debit-card overdraft protection may benefit consumers.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a82_3ay_3a2015_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a219-257.htm,10.1093/restud/rdu024

In doing so, we overcome a large number of problems that have plagued spatial price index measurement. We identify two important sources of bias. Heterogeneity bias arises from comparing different goods in different locations, and variety bias arises from not correcting for the fact that some goods are unavailable in some locations. Eliminating heterogeneity bias causes 97% of the variance in the price level of food products across cities to disappear relative to a conventional index. Eliminating both biases reverses the common finding that prices tend to be higher in larger cities. Instead, we find that price level for food products falls with city size.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a82_3ay_3a2015_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a258-296.htm,10.1093/restud/rdu033

When two parties write a long-term contract that has to be renegotiated after the realization of the state of the world, they take the initial contract as a reference point to which they compare gains and losses of the renegotiated transaction. We show that loss aversion makes the renegotiated outcome sticky and materially inefficient. The theory has important implications for the optimal design of long-term contracts. First, it explains why parties often abstain from writing a beneficial long-term contract or why some contracts specify transactions that are never ex post efficient. Secondly, it shows under what conditions parties should rely on the allocation of ownership rights to protect relationship-specific investments rather than writing a specific performance contract. Thirdly, it shows that employment contracts can be strictly optimal even if parties are free to renegotiate.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a82_3ay_3a2015_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a297-332.htm,10.1093/restud/rdu034

Equilibrium prices are high, because consumers understand that visiting a store exposes them to a hold-up problem. However, a firm with more products charges lower prices, because it attracts consumers who are more price sensitive. Similarly, when a firm advertises a low price on one product, consumers rationally expect it to charge somewhat lower prices on its other products as well. We therefore find that having a large product range, and advertising a low price on one product, are substitute ways of building a “low-price image”. Finally, we show that in a competitive setting each product has a high regular price, with firms occasionally giving random discounts that are positively correlated across products.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a82_3ay_3a2015_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a360-390.htm,10.1093/restud/rdu032

The main result of the article is a characterization of the allocations that can be implemented as equilibria in our contracting game. We then restrict attention to exclusive-contracting environments, in which the agent may select the contract of at most one principal. In this setting, our characterization result implies that principals can collude to implement the monopolist outcome. Finally, in general, equilibrium contracts turn out to be incomplete.

In multi-unit auctions, bids for marginal units may affect payments for inframarginal units, giving rise to “demand reduction” and furthermore to incentives for shading bids differently across units. We establish that such differential bid shading results generically in ex post inefficient allocations in the uniform-price and pay-as-bid auctions. We also show that, in general, the efficiency and revenue rankings of the two formats are ambiguous. However, in settings with symmetric bidders, the pay-as-bid auction often outperforms. In particular, with diminishing marginal utility, symmetric information and linearity, it yields greater expected revenues. We explain the rankings through multi-unit effects, which have no counterparts in auctions with unit demands.

Progressively learning about preferences generate round–trip trades, which increase volume relative to the frictionless market.

Thus, cheap-talk communication facilitates the market's learning of a seller's ability and strengthens reputation effects.

The leading explanations for this pattern are that over time, either employers learn about worker productivity but productivity remains fixed or workers' productivities themselves evolve heterogeneously. We propose a dynamic specification that nests both employer learning and dynamic productivity heterogeneity. We estimate this model on a 20-year panel of pay and performance measures from a single, large firm. The advantage of these data is that they provide us with repeat measures of productivity, some of which have not yet been observed by the firm when it sets wages. We use our estimates to investigate how learning and dynamic productivity heterogeneity jointly contribute to the increase in pay dispersion with age. We find that both mechanisms are important for understanding wage dynamics. The dispersion of pay increases with experience primarily because productivity differences increase. Imperfect learning, however, means that wages differ significantly from individual productivity all along the life cycle because firms continuously struggle to learn about a moving target in worker productivity. Our estimates allow us to calculate the degree to which imperfect learning introduces a wedge between the private and social incentives to invest in human capital. We find that these disincentives exist throughout the life cycle but increase rapidly after about 15 years of experience. Thus, in contrast to the existing literature on employer learning, we find that imperfect learning might have especially large effects on investments among older workers.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a81_3ay_3a2014_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a1575-1613.htm,10.1093/restud/rdu021

Under these conditions alone, and given rich enough support of the data, potential outcome distributions, the average structural function, and quantile structural functions are point identified.

Instead, cuts in marginal labour tax rates are inflationary and become more expansionary when the zero lower bound is binding.

As in other dynamic settings, I find that startup costs limit the ability of firms to change production over time, exacerbating fluctuations in market prices. These fluctuations can induce estimates of market power that ignore dynamic costs to overstate markup volatility, with predicted markups that can be even negative in periods of low demand.

Estimation results demonstrate that the demand for PCs is highly segmented, and that fixed costs consume a substantial portion of the per-unit producer profit.

To study these conditions, and in particular the role played by social ties, we use a Swedish population-wide linked employer–employee data set of graduates from all levels of schooling that includes detailed information on family ties, neighbourhoods, schools, class composition, and parents' and children's employers over a period covering years with both high and low unemployment, together with measures of firm performance. We find that strong social ties (parents) are an important determinant for where young workers find their first job. The effects are larger if the graduate's position is “weak” (low education, bad grades), during high unemployment years, and when information on potential openings are likely to be scarce. On the hiring side, by contrast, the effects are larger if the parent's position is “strong” (long tenure, high wage) and if the parent's plant is more productive. The youths appear to benefit from the use of strong social ties through faster access to jobs and by better labour market outcomes as measured a few years after entry. In particular, workers finding their entry jobs through strong social ties are considerably more likely to remain in this job, while experiencing better wage growth than other entrants in the same plant. Firms also appear to benefit from these wage costs (relative to comparable entrants) starting at a lower base. They also benefit on the parents' side; parents' wage growth drops dramatically exactly at the entry of one of their children in the plant, although this is a moment when firm profits tend to be growing. Indeed, the firm-side benefits appear large enough for (at least small) firms to increase job creation at the entry level in years when a child of one of their employees graduates.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a81_3ay_3a2014_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1164-1200.htm,10.1093/restud/rdt049

Tighter deadlines and higher penalties induce higher effort, but increase the agent's risk. We model how these contract terms affect the work rate and time-to-completion in a procurement setting, characterizing the efficient contract design. Using new micro-level data on Minnesota highway construction contracts that includes day-by-day information on work plans, hours worked and delays, we find evidence of ex post moral hazard: contractors adjust their effort level during the course of the contract in response to unanticipated productivity shocks, in a way that is consistent with our theoretical predictions. We next build an econometric model that endogenizes the completion time as a function of the contract terms and the productivity shocks, and simulate how commuter welfare and contractor costs vary across different terms and shocks. Accounting for the traffic delays caused by construction, switching to a more efficient contract design would increase welfare by 22.5% of the contract value while increasing the standard deviation of contractor costs—a measure of risk—by less than 1% of the contract value.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a81_3ay_3a2014_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1201-1228.htm,10.1093/restud/rdu002

This learning process is consistent with a number of key facts about occupational mobility, such as the offsetting worker flows across occupations, the non-random patterns of occupational transitions, and the decline of occupational switching with age. We illustrate how search frictions delay learning and lead to mismatch, thereby reducing worker productivity. Moreover, we explore how different workers perform in different occupations. Are the best workers in one occupation also the best workers in another occupation (one-dimensional model of ability)? Or are some workers good at one occupation and other workers good at a different one (comparative advantage model)?

Unlike in standard taxation models, firms do not know workers' abilities, and competitively screen them through non-linear compensation contracts, unobservable to the government, in a Miyazaki–Wilson–Spence equilibrium. Adverse selection leads to different optimal tax formulas than in the standard Mirrlees (1971) model because of the use of work hours as a screening tool by firms, which for higher talent workers results in a “rat race”, and for lower talent workers in informational rents and cross-subsidies. The most surprising result is that, if the government has sufficiently strong redistributive goals, welfare is higher when there is adverse selection than when there is not. Policies that endogenously affect adverse selection are discussed. The model has practical implications for the interpretation, estimation, and use of taxable income elasticities, which are central to optimal tax design.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a81_3ay_3a2014_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a1296-1329.htm,10.1093/restud/rdu005

Following the evidence from neuroscience, we model the brain as an organization in which a coordinator allocates limited resources to the brain systems responsible for the different tasks. Systems are privately informed about the amount of resources necessary to perform their task and compete to obtain the resources. The coordinator arbitrates the demands while satisfying the resource constraint. We show that the optimal mechanism is to impose to each system with privately known needs a cap in resources that depends negatively on the amount of resources requested by the other system. This allocation can be implemented using a biologically plausible mechanism. Finally, we provide some implications of our theory: (i) performance can be flawless for sufficiently simple tasks, (ii) the dynamic allocation rule exhibits inertia (current allocations are increasing in past needs), and (iii) different cognitive tasks are performed by different systems only if the tasks are sufficiently important.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a81_3ay_3a2014_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a501-534.htm,10.1093/restud/rdt043

Testing Credit Constraints Using a Directed Lending Program,"['Abhijit Banerjee', 'Esther Duflo']","2014, vol. 81, issue 2, 572-607",[],"Abstract: This article uses variation in access to a targeted lending program to estimate whether firms are credit constrained. While both constrained and unconstrained firms may be willing to absorb all the directed credit that they can get (because it may be cheaper than other sources of credit), constrained firms will use it to expand production, while unconstrained firms will primarily use it as a substitute for other borrowing. We apply these observations to firms in India that became eligible for directed credit as a result of a policy change in 1998, and lost eligibility as a result of the reversal of this reform in 2000, and to smaller firms that were already eligible for the preferential credit before 1998 and remained eligible in 2000. Comparing the trends in the sales and the profits of these two groups of firms, we show that there is no evidence that directed credit is being used as a substitute for other forms of credit. Instead, the credit was used to finance more productionâ€“there was a large acceleration in the rate of growth of sales and profits for these firms in 1998, and a corresponding decline in 2000. There was no change in trends around either date for the small firms. We conclude that many of the firms must have been severely credit constrained, and that the marginal rate of return to capital was very high for these firms.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a81_3ay_3a2014_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a572-607.htm,10.1093/restud/rdt046

We allow for the number of regressors to be larger than the sample size. To make informative inference feasible, we require the model to be approximately sparse; that is, we require that the effect of confounding factors can be controlled for up to a small approximation error by including a relatively small number of variables whose identities are unknown. The latter condition makes it possible to estimate the treatment effect by selecting approximately the right set of regressors. We develop a novel estimation and uniformly valid inference method for the treatment effect in this setting, called the â€œpost-double-selectionâ€ method. The main attractive feature of our method is that it allows for imperfect selection of the controls and provides confidence intervals that are valid uniformly across a large class of models. In contrast, standard post-model selection estimators fail to provide uniform inference even in simple cases with a small, fixed number of controls. Thus, our method resolves the problem of uniform inference after model selection for a large, interesting class of models. We also present a generalization of our method to a fully heterogeneous model with a binary treatment variable. We illustrate the use of the developed methods with numerical simulations and an application that considers the effect of abortion on crime rates.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a81_3ay_3a2014_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a608-650.htm,10.1093/restud/rdt044

Moreover, this inequality gap has further widened during this period as the U.S. has experienced a large increase in wage inequality, whereas the CEU has seen only modest changes. This article studies the role of labour income tax policies for understanding these facts, focusing on male workers. We construct a life cycle model in which individuals decide each period whether to go to school, work, or stay non-employed. Individuals can accumulate human capital either in school or while working. Wage inequality arises from differences across individuals in their ability to learn new skills as well as from idiosyncratic shocks. Progressive taxation compresses the (after-tax) wage structure, thereby distorting the incentives to accumulate human capital, in turn reducing the cross-sectional dispersion of (before-tax) wages. Consistent with the model, we empirically document that countries with more progressive labour income tax schedules have (i) significantly lower before-tax wage inequality at different points in time and (ii) experienced a smaller rise in wage inequality since the early 1980s. We then study the calibrated model and find that these policies can account for half of the difference between the U.S. and the CEU in overall wage inequality and 84% of the difference in inequality at the upper end (log 90â€“50 differential). In a two-country comparison between the U.S. and Germany, the combination of skill-biased technical change and changing progressivity of tax schedules explains all the difference between the evolution of inequality in these two countries since the early 1980s.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a81_3ay_3a2014_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a818-850.htm,10.1093/restud/rdt042

In a limited commitment economy, there are externalities associated with capital and labour because individuals do not take into account that their labour and saving decisions affect aggregate labour and capital supply and wages, and thus the value of autarky. Therefore, a Ramsey government has an additional goal, which is to internalize these externalities of labour and capital to improve risk sharing, in addition to its usual goalâ€”minimizing distortions in financing government expenditures. These two goals drive capital and labour taxes in opposite directions. It is shown that the steady-state optimal capital income taxes are levied only to remove the negative externality of the capital, whereas optimal labour income taxes are set to meet the budgetary needs of the government in the long run, despite the presence of positive externalities of labour.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a81_3ay_3a2014_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a884-918.htm,10.1093/restud/rdt038

Our empirical results indicate that both parents' time inputs are important for the cognitive development of their children, particularly when the child is young. Money expenditures are less productive in terms of producing child quality. Comparative statics exercises demonstrate that cash transfers to households with children have small impacts on child quality due to the relatively low impact of money investments on child outcomes and the fact that a significant fraction of the transfer is spent on other household consumption and the leisure of the parents.

Finally, we use these estimates to conduct a welfare analysis evaluating the benefits or costs of trade through the income risk channel. We find import penetration to have a statistically significant association with labour income risk in the U.S. Our welfare calculations suggest that these effects are economically significant.

We study how these two policy instruments affect return-to-work and medium-run labour market outcomes of mothers of newborn children. Analysing a series of major PL policy changes in Austria, we find that longer cash benefits lead to a significant delay in return-to-work, particularly so in the period that is job-protected. Prolonged parental leave absence induced by these policy changes does not appear to hurt mothers' labour market outcomes in the medium run. We build a non-stationary model of job search after childbirth to isolate the role of the two policy instruments. The model matches return-to-work and return to same employer profiles under the various factual policy configurations. Counterfactual policy simulations indicate that a system that combines cash with protection dominates other systems in generating time for care immediately after birth while maintaining mothers' medium-run labour market attachment.

Estimation is based on a unique dataset that merges transaction details from both the primary and secondary markets for tickets to major rock concerts.

We use non-random sorting into inter-ethnic marriage and salient differences between Sephardic and Ashkenazi surnames to evaluate the causal impact of Sephardic affiliation on wages. Using the 1995 Israeli Census, we estimate the effect of a Sephardic sounding surname on wages. We first compare the wages of Israeli Jewish males born to Sephardic fathers and Ashkenazi mothers (SA), who are more likely to carry a Sephardic surname, with the wages of Israeli Jewish males born to Ashkenazi fathers and Sephardic mothers (AS). We find that Israeli labour markets discriminate based on perceived ethnicity: SA workers earn significantly less than their AS counterparts. We then exploit the custom of women to adopt their husbands' surnames to disentangle actual ethnicity from the ethnicity perceived by the market. Consistent with ethnic discrimination based on surnames, we find that it is father-in-law's ethnicity--rather than father's ethnicity--that shapes female wage rates. Finally, we find that labour markets discriminate based on surname only when those names provide additional information about ethnicity. When ethnicity can be discerned from skin tone, surnames do not provide additional explanatory power with respect to wages.

Seemingly unproductive costs thus serve to screen out free-riders, attract conditional cooperators, boost club production, and increase member welfare.

Our instrumental variables estimates show that internet use is associated with a substantial increase in both reports, charges and convictions of rape and other sex crimes. We present a conceptual framework that highlights three mechanisms for how internet use may affect reported sex crime, namely a reporting effect, a matching effect on potential offenders and victims, and a direct effect on sex crime propensity. To investigate the importance of these mechanisms, we use data on individual reporting behaviour, police investigations, and criminal charges and convictions. None of the analyses we perform suggest that the positive relationship between internet use and sex crime is driven by changes in reporting behaviour.

Rather than constructing a stock of knowledge capital from a firm's observed R&D expenditures, we consider productivity to be unobservable to the econometrician. Our approach accounts for uncertainty, non-linearity, and heterogeneity across firms in the link between R&D and productivity. We also derive a novel estimator for production functions in this setting. Using an unbalanced panel of more than 1800 Spanish manufacturing firms in nine industries during the 1990s, we provide evidence of non-linearities as well as economically significant uncertainties in the R&D process.

Theory suggests two opposite effects. If labour is used to appropriate resources violently, higher wages may lower conflict by reducing labour supplied to appropriation. This is the opportunity cost effect. Alternatively, a rise in contestable income may increase violence by raising gains from appropriation. This is the rapacity effect. Our article exploits exogenous price shocks in international commodity markets and a rich dataset on civil war in Colombia to assess how different income shocks affect conflict. We examine changes in the price of agricultural goods (which are labour intensive) as well as natural resources (which are not). We focus on Colombia's two largest exports, coffee and oil. We find that a sharp fall in coffee prices during the 1990s lowered wages and increased violence differentially in municipalities cultivating more coffee. This is consistent with the coffee shock inducing an opportunity cost effect. In contrast, a rise in oil prices increased both municipal revenue and violence differentially in the oil region. This is consistent with the oil shock inducing a rapacity effect. We also show that this pattern holds in six other agricultural and natural resource sectors, providing evidence that price shocks affect conflict in different directions depending on the type of the commodity.

Holding fixed the number of signals available to citizens, if the per-unit signal precision is sufficiently high then the regime is harder to overthrow.

Evidence from an additional treatment arm shows that, holding meeting frequency fixed, the pattern is insensitive to repayment frequency during the first loan cycle.

Further disaggregation of capital flows reveals that the allocation puzzle is also related to the pattern of accumulation of international reserves.

Investigating settings with both exogenous and endogenous information structures, we find that agency theory is indeed useful to qualitatively predict how variations in the degree of uncertainty affect subjects' behaviour. Regarding the quantitative deviations from standard predictions, our analysis based on several control treatments and quantal response estimations shows that agents' behaviour can be explained by social preferences that are less pronounced than in conventional ultimatum games. Principals' own social preferences are not an important determinant of their behaviour.

We find sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a stochastic search equilibrium in such contracts, which is Rank Preserving [RP]: larger and more productive firms offer more generous contracts to their workers in all states of the world.

If such checks and balances limit presidential abuses of power and rents, why do voters support their removal? We argue that by reducing politician rents, checks and balances also make it cheaper to bribe or influence politicians through non-electoral means. In weakly institutionalized polities where such non-electoral influences, particularly by the better organized elite, are a major concern, voters may prefer a political system without checks and balances as a way of insulating politicians from these influences. When they do so, they are effectively accepting a certain amount of politician (presidential) rents in return for redistribution. We show that checks and balances are less likely to emerge when the elite is better organized and is more likely to be able to influence or bribe politicians, and when inequality and potential taxes are high (which makes redistribution more valuable to the majority).

On observing that this parameter may be weakly identified, we propose likelihood-ratio-type tests as well as Fieller-type procedures based on a Hotelling-HAC statistic, which are robust to weak identification and allow for non-Gaussian distributions including parametric GARCH structures. The Fieller-Hotelling-HAC procedure also accounts (asymptotically) for general forms of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. We propose confidence sets for the zero-beta rate based on ""inverting"" exact tests for this parameter; for both procedures proposed, these sets can be interpreted as multivariate extensions of the classic Fieller method for inference on ratios. The exact distribution of likelihood-ratio-type statistics for testing efficiency is studied under both the null and the alternative hypotheses. The relevant nuisance parameter structure is established and finite-sample bound procedures are proposed, which extend and improve available Gaussian-specific bounds. Finite-sample distributional invariance results are also demonstrated analytically for the HAC statistic proposed by MacKinlay and Richardson (1991) . We study invariance to portfolio repacking for the tests and confidence sets proposed.

Empirical results on NYSE returns show that exact confidence sets are very different from asymptotic ones, and allowing for non-Gaussian distributions affects inference results.

We assume that social memory is finite--every player, except possibly one, is finitely lived and cannot observe events that are sufficiently far back in the past. This class of games includes games between a long-run player and a sequence of short-run players, and games with overlapping generations of players. An equilibrium is purifiable if some close-by behaviour is consistent with equilibrium when agents' payoffs in each period are perturbed additively and independently. We show that only Markov equilibria are purifiable when social memory is finite. Thus if a game has at most one long-run player, all purifiable equilibria are Markov.

We test three theories that predict such relative overconfidence. The first theory argues that overconfidence can be generated by Bayesian updating from a common prior and truthful statements if individuals do not know their true type. The second theory suggests that self-image concerns asymmetrically affect the choice to receive new information about one's abilities, and this asymmetry can produce overconfidence. The third theory is that overconfidence is induced by the desire to send positive signals to others about one's own skill; this suggests either a bias in judgement, strategic lying, or both. We formulate this theory precisely. Using a large data set of relative ability judgements about two cognitive tests, we reject the restrictions imposed by the Bayesian model and also reject a key prediction of the self-image models that individuals with optimistic beliefs will be less likely to search for further information about their skill because this information might shatter their self-image. We provide evidence that personality traits strongly affect relative ability judgements in a pattern that is consistent with the third theory of social signalling. Our results together suggest that overconfidence in statements is more likely to be induced by social concerns than by either of the other two factors.

The agent receives a fixed prize when her prediction error, defined by a loss function specified in the incentive scheme, is smaller than an independently generated random number and earns a smaller prize otherwise. Adjusting the loss function according to the belief elicitation objective, the scoring rule can be used in a rich assortment of situations. Moreover, the scoring rule can be incentive compatible even when the agent is not an expected utility maximizer. Results from our probability elicitation experiments show that subjects' predictions are closer to the true probability under this scoring rule compared to the quadratic scoring rule.

When customers are fully rational, it is optimal for sellers to offer the right to cancel or return on favourable terms. A generous return policy makes the seller's ""cheap talk"" at the point of sale credible. This observation provides a possible explanation for the excess refund puzzle and also has implications for the management of customer reviews. When customers are credulous, instead, sellers have an incentive to set unfavourable terms to exploit the inflated beliefs they induce in their customers. The imposition of a minimum statutory standard improves welfare and consumer surplus when customers are credulous.

This article argues that models of intra-household allocation could be useful for understanding aggregate labour supply trends in the U.S. since the 1970s. A simple calculation suggests that the standard model without bargaining predicts a 19% decline in married-male labour supply in response to the narrowing of the gender gap in wages since the 1970s. However married-men's paid labour remained stationary over the period from the mid 1970s to the recession of 2001. This article develops and calibrates to U.S. time-use survey data a model of marital bargaining in which time allocations are determined jointly with equilibrium marriage and divorce rates. The results suggest that bargaining effects raised married-men's labour supply by about 2.1 weekly hours over the period, and reduced that of married women by 2.7 hours. Bargaining therefore has a relatively small impact on aggregate labour supply, but is critical for trends in female labour supply. Also, the narrowing of the gender wage gap is found to account for a weekly 1.5 hour increase in aggregate labour supply.

626,Review of Economic Studies,On-the-Job Search and Precautionary Savings,['Jeremy Lise'],"2013, vol. 80, issue 3, 1086-1113",[],"Abstract: In this article, I develop and estimate a model of on-the-job search in which risk averse workers choose search effort and can borrow or save using a single risk free asset. I derive the implications for optimal savings behaviour in this environment and relate this to the frictions that characterize the endogenous earnings process implied by on-the-job search. Savings behaviour depends in a very intuitive way on the rate at which offers are received, the rate at which jobs are destroyed, and a worker's current rank in the wage distribution. The implication is that workers, who are identical in terms of preferences and opportunities, have substantially different savings behaviour depending on their history and current position in the wage distribution. The mechanism that generates the substantial differences in savings behaviour in the model is the dynamic of the ""wage ladder"" resulting from the search process. There is an important asymmetry between the incremental wage increases generated by on-the-job search (climbing the ladder) and the drop in income associated with job loss (falling off the ladder). The behaviour of workers in low paying jobs is primarily governed by the expectation of wage growth, while the behaviour of workers near the top of the distribution is driven by the possibility of job loss. The distributions of earnings, wealth, and consumption implied by the model (suitably aggregated) align reasonably well with the data, with the notable exception of implying substantially less concentration of wealth among the richest one percent of the population.

The onset of conflict signals that the aggressor has a low propensity to cooperate, harming future trust and trade. Agents observe the history of conflicts and update their beliefs over time. The theory predicts that civil wars are persistent. Moreover, even accidental conflicts that do not reflect economic fundamentals erode trust, and can plunge a society into a vicious cycle of recurrent conflicts (a war trap). The incidence of conflict can be reduced by policies abating cultural barriers, fostering inter-ethnic trade and human capital, and shifting beliefs.

In this article, I quantitatively evaluate the role of liquidity demand in accounting for this puzzle: households that accumulate credit card debt may not pay it off using their money in the bank, because they anticipate needing that money in situations where credit cards cannot be used. I characterize the puzzle in survey data, and calibrate a dynamic stochastic heterogeneous-agent model of household portfolio choice, where consumer credit and liquidity coexist as means of consumption and saving, where households consume a cash good and a credit good, and where cash consumption is subject to uncertainty. The model accounts for between 44% and 56% of the households in the data who hold consumer debt and liquidity simultaneously, and for 100% of the liquidity held by a median such household. Under reasonable calibration alternatives, the model can capture the entire puzzle group size as well. One-half of money demand in the model is precautionary.

Agents with anticipatory preferences, linked through an interaction structure, choose how to interpret and recall public signals about future prospects. Wishful thinking (denial of bad news) is shown to be contagious when it is harmful to others, and self-limiting when it is beneficial. Similarly, with Kreps--Porteus preferences, willful blindness (information avoidance) spreads when it increases the risks borne by others. This general mechanism can generate multiple social cognitions of reality, and in hierarchies it implies that realism and delusion will trickle down from the leaders.

Resoluteness allows leaders to overcome a time-consistency problem that arises from the fact that leaders learn about the best course of action for the organization over time.

A simple way to implement this is to make day care expenses tax deductible.

Individual productivity evolves as a Markov process and is private information. We use a first-order approach in discrete and continuous time and obtain novel theoretical and numerical results. Our main contribution is a formula describing the dynamics for the labour-income tax rate. When productivity is an AR(1) our formula resembles an AR(1) with a trend where: (i) the auto-regressive coefficient equals that of productivity; (ii) the trend term equals the covariance productivity with consumption growth divided by the Frisch elasticity of labour; and (iii) the innovations in the tax rate are the negative of consumption growth. The last property implies a form of short-run regressivity. Our simulations illustrate these results and deliver some novel insights. The average labour tax rises from 0% to 37% over 40 years, whereas the average tax on savings falls from 12% to 0% at retirement. We compare the second best solution to simple history-independent tax systems, calibrated to mimic these average tax rates.

This article identifies and quantifies the three mechanisms through which credit constraints affect trade: the selection of heterogeneous firms into domestic production, the selection of domestic manufacturers into exporting, and the level of firm exports. I incorporate financial frictions into a heterogeneous-firm model and apply it to aggregate trade data for a large panel of countries. I establish causality by exploiting the variation in financial development across countries and the variation in financial vulnerability across sectors. About 20%--25% of the impact of credit constraints on trade is driven by reductions in total output. Of the additional, trade-specific effect, one-third reflects limited firm entry into exporting, while two-thirds are due to contractions in exporters' sales. Financially developed economies export more in financially vulnerable sectors because they enter more markets, ship more products to each destination, and sell more of each product. These results have important policy implications for less developed nations that rely on exports for economic growth but suffer from weak financial institutions.

We construct a simple Malthusian model with two sectors and multiple steady states, and use it to explain why European per capita incomes and urbanization rates increased during the period 1350--1700. Productivity growth can only explain a small fraction of the rise in output per capita. Population dynamics--changes of the birth and death schedules--were far more important determinants of steady states. We show how a major shock to population can trigger a transition to a new steady state with higher per-capita income. The Black Death was such a shock, raising wages substantially. Because of Engel's Law, demand for urban products increased, and urban centers grew in size. European cities were unhealthy, and rising urbanization pushed up aggregate death rates. This effect was reinforced by diseases spread through war, financed by higher tax revenues. In addition, rising trade also spread diseases. In this way higher wages themselves reduced population pressure. We show in a calibration exercise that our model can account for the sustained rise in European urbanization as well as permanently higher per capita incomes in 1700, without technological change. Wars contributed importantly to the ""Rise of Europe"", even if they had negative short-run effects. We thus trace Europe's precocious rise to economic riches to interactions of the plague shock with the belligerent political environment and the nature of cities.

In addition, the realized values are also private information. We characterize a class of environments in which the profit-maximizing long-term contract offered by a monopolist takes an especially simple structure: we derive sufficient conditions on primitives under which the optimal contract consists of a menu of deterministic sequences of static contracts. Within each sequence, higher realized values lead to greater quantity provision; however, an increasing proportion of buyer types are excluded over time, eventually leading to inefficiently early termination of the relationship.

Market makers in each asset can only condition their pricing functions on trading in each asset. Using daily non-public data from the New York Stock Exchange, we test the model's predictions on the conditional and unconditional lead--lag relations of institutional order flow and returns within portfolios. We find support for the model prediction of positive autocorrelations in portfolio returns as well as the predictions for how informed order flow positively predicts future returns and future informed order flow. We show that these relations strengthen for portfolios formed from assets within the same industry, which likely have higher correlation of fundamental values. Furthermore, we discuss issues that arise when testing implications of strategic models with imperfect proxies for the underlying strategic behaviour.

Unlike most previous work, we estimate wage effects along the distribution of native wages. We derive a flexible empirical strategy that does not rely on pre-allocating immigrants to particular skill groups. In our empirical analysis, we demonstrate that immigrants downgrade considerably upon arrival. As for the effects on native wages, we find a pattern of effects whereby immigration depresses wages below the 20th percentile of the wage distribution but leads to slight wage increases in the upper part of the wage distribution. This pattern mirrors the evidence on the location of immigrants in the wage distribution. We suggest that possible explanations for the overall slightly positive effect on native wages, besides standard immigration surplus arguments, could involve deviations of immigrant remuneration from contribution to production either because of initial mismatch or immigrant downgrading.

The empirical procedure exploits manufacturers' and retailers' first-order conditions in conjunction with detailed information on the frequency of price adjustments following exchange rate changes to quantify the relative importance of local non-traded cost components, markup adjustment by manufacturers and retailers, and nominal price rigidities in the incomplete transmission of such changes to prices. We find that, on average, approximately 60% of the incomplete exchange rate pass-through is due to local non-traded costs; 8% to markup adjustment; 30% to the existence of own brand price adjustment costs; and 1% to the indirect/strategic effect of such costs, though these results vary considerably across individual brands according to their market shares.

We find that firms operating in less financially developed markets offer lower entry wages but faster wage growth than firms in more financially developed markets. This helps firms finance their operations by implicitly raising funds from workers. We control for local market fixed effects and only exploit time variation in the degree of local financial development induced by an exogenous liberalization, so that the effect we find is unlikely to reflect unobserved local factors that systematically affect wage--tenure profiles. We estimate that the amount of credit generated by implicit lending within the firm is economically important and can be as large as 30 percent of the bank lending. Consistent with credit market imperfections opening up trade opportunities within the firm, we find that the internal rate of return of implicit loans lies between the rate at which workers savings are remunerated in the market and the rate that firms pay on their loans from banks.

We revisit these conclusions using theory and data on inventories. We study an economy with nominal rigidities in which goods are storable. Our theory predicts that if costs of production are sticky and markups do not vary much in response to, say, expansionary monetary policy, firms react by excessively accumulating inventories in anticipation of future cost increases. In contrast, if the data inventories are fairly constant over the cycle and in response to changes in monetary policy. We show that costs must increase and markups must decline sufficiently in times of a monetary expansion in order to reduce firm's incentive to hold inventories and thus bring the model's inventory predictions in line with the data. Versions of the model consistent with the dynamics of inventories in the data imply that countercyclical markups account for a sizable fraction of the response of real variables to monetary shocks.

The precise level of voter turnout, along with the margin of victory, are determined by the distribution of expertise. Improving a voter's information makes her more willing to vote, consistent with a growing body of empirical evidence, but makes her peers more willing to abstain, providing a new explanation for various empirical patterns of voting.

We evaluate and compare their effects on time until job entry, stability of employment, and earnings. Further, we examine the heterogeneity of treatment effects according to the timing of training during unemployment as well as across different subgroups of participants. We find that participating in short-term training reduces the remaining time in unemployment and moderately increases job stability. Long-term training programs initially prolong the remaining time in unemployment, but once the scheduled program end is reached participants exit to employment at a much faster rate than without training. In addition, they benefit from substantially more stable employment spells and higher earnings. Overall, long-term training programs are well effective in supporting the occupational advancement of very heterogeneous groups of participants, including those with generally weak labor market prospects. However, from a fiscal perspective only the low-cost short-term training schemes are cost efficient in the short run.

If players are equally well monitored, comparative statics on the maximum level of cooperation are highly tractable and depend on the monitoring technology only through a simple statistic, its effective contagiousness. Typically, cooperation in the provision of pure public goods is greater in larger groups, while cooperation in the provision of divisible public goods is greater in smaller groups, and making monitoring less uncertain in the second-order stochastic dominance sense increases cooperation. For fixed monitoring networks, a new notion of network centrality is developed, which determines which players cooperate more in a given network, as well as which networks support greater cooperation.

The number of bidding rounds is determined by how frequently the buyer can make an offer. We show that with no limit on the frequency and without discounting, the price path is either kept flat initially with large jumps at the end or increasing steadily over time. Which class of path occurs in equilibrium depends on the buyer's trade-off between committing to a price ceiling versus finely screening the sellers' costs. With discounting, limiting the number of rounds mitigates the delay caused by the reluctance to raise bids in the first class of equilibrium and therefore can benefit the buyer. This result suggests why, in reality, bargaining parties often take measures to make their offers rigid and consequently force themselves to make fewer offers.

These preferences are taken as given, not derived from more primitive ones. Our aim is to establish an axiomatic foundation providing the link between observation of choices and a functional representation which is convenient, free of inconsistencies and can provide the basis for measurement. The dependence among preferences may take place in two conceptually different ways, expressing two different views of the nature of interdependent preferences. The first is Festinger's view that the evaluation of peers' outcomes is useful to improve individual choices by learning from the comparison. The second is Veblen's view that interdependent preferences keep track of social status derived from a social value attributed to the goods one consumes. Corresponding to these two different views, we have two different formulations. In the first, the decision maker values his outcomes and those of others on the basis of his own utility. In the second, he ranks outcomes according to a social value function. We give different axiomatic foundations to these two different, but complementary, views of the nature of the interdependence. On the basis of this axiomatic foundation, we build a behavioural theory of comparative statics within subjects and across subjects. We characterize preferences according to the relative importance assigned to gains and losses in social domain, that is pride and envy. This parallels the standard analysis of private gains and losses (as well as that of regret and relief). We give an axiomatic foundation of interpersonal comparison of preferences, ordering individuals according to their sensitivity to social ranking.

This paper examines how income taxes affect time allocation during the entire day and how these time allocation decisions interact with expenditure patterns. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics from 1975 to 2004, we analyse the response of single women's housework, labour supply, and other time to variation in tax and transfer schedules across income levels, number of children, states, and time. We find that when the economic reward to participating in the labour force increases, market work increases and housework decreases, with the decrease in housework accounting for approximately two-thirds of the increase in market work. Analysis of repeated cross sections of time diary data from 1975 to 2004 shows that ""home production"" decreases substantially when market hours of work increase in response to policy changes. Data on expenditures show some evidence that expenditures on market goods likely to substitute for housework increase in response to a greater incentive to join the labour force. The baseline estimates imply that the elasticity of substitution between consumption of home and market goods is 2.61. The results are consistent with the Becker model. Meanwhile, single men show little response to changes in tax policy, and we are able to rule out an elasticity of substitution between home and market goods for this group of more than 1.66.

When job offers become more dispersed, wage inequality increases and workers work longer hours to obtain better jobs. As a result, average hours per worker in the economy increase. This mechanism accounts for around two-thirds of the increase in hours observed in data. Part of the increase is inefficient since workers obtain better jobs at the expense of other workers competing for the same jobs.

We focus on estimation by local linear regression, which was shown to have attractive properties (Porter, J. 2003, ""Estimation in the Regression Discontinuity Model"" (unpublished, Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin, Madison)). We derive the asymptotically optimal bandwidth under squared error loss. This optimal bandwidth depends on unknown functionals of the distribution of the data and we propose simple and consistent estimators for these functionals to obtain a fully data-driven bandwidth algorithm. We show that this bandwidth estimator is optimal according to the criterion of Li (1987, ""Asymptotic Optimality for C p , C L , Cross-validation and Generalized Cross-validation: Discrete Index Set"", Annals of Statistics, 15, 958--975), although it is not unique in the sense that alternative consistent estimators for the unknown functionals would lead to bandwidth estimators with the same optimality properties. We illustrate the proposed bandwidth, and the sensitivity to the choices made in our algorithm, by applying the methods to a data set previously analysed by Lee (2008, ""Randomized Experiments from Non-random Selection in U.S. House Elections"", Journal of Econometrics, 142, 675--697) as well as by conducting a small simulation study.

A municipal government can be viewed as a hierarchy, whose stability over time depends on the degree of cooperation between and within ranks. We find that in municipalities headed by female mayors, the probability of early termination of the legislature is higher. This result persists and becomes stronger when we control for municipality fixed effects as well as for non-random sorting of women into municipalities using regression discontinuity in gender-mixed electoral races decided by a narrow margin. The likelihood that a female mayor survives until the end of her term is lowest when the council is entirely male and in regions with less favourable attitudes towards working women. This evidence is suggestive that group dynamics are an important factor in driving the gender difference. Other interpretations receive less support in the data.

The key trade-off is that of enlarging the agent's choice set versus adding costly incentive constraints.

Each decision-maker chooses an action and receives an informative but imperfect signal of the once-and-for-all realization of an unobserved state. The state affects all individuals' preferences over present and future decisions. Decision-makers do not directly observe the realized signals or actions of their predecessors. Instead, they must rely on cheap-talk messages in order to accumulate information about the state. Each decision-maker is therefore both a receiver of information with respect to his decision and a sender with respect to all future decisions. We show that if preferences are not perfectly aligned, ""full learning"" equilibria--ones in which the individuals' posterior beliefs eventually place full weight on the true state--do not exist. This is so both in the case of private communication, in which each individual only hears the message of his immediate predecessor, and in the case of public communication, in which a decision-maker hears the message of all his predecessors. Surprisingly, in the latter case full learning may be impossible even in the limit as all members of the organization become perfectly patient. We also consider the case where all individuals have access to a mediator who can work across time periods arbitrarily far apart. In this case, full learning equilibria exist.

This defines a ""Keynesian"" region; the complementary region is ""Hayekian"" in that rational investors chase the trend and prices are systematically closer to fundamentals than average expectations. The standard case of no residual uncertainty and liquidity trading following a random walk is on the frontier of the two regions and identifies the set of deep parameters for which rational investors abide by Keynes' dictum of concentrating on an asset ""long-term prospects and those only"".

This paper tests empirically for the relevance of three aspects of the attitude transmission process highlighted in this theoretical literature: (1) transmission of attitudes from parents to children; (2) an impact of prevailing attitudes in the local environment on child attitudes; and (3) positive assortative mating of parents, which enhances the ability of a parent to pass on his or her attitudes to the child. We focus on two fundamentally important attitudes, willingness to take risks and willingness to trust others. We find empirical support for all three aspects, providing an empirical underpinning for the literature. An investigation of underlying mechanisms shows that socialization is important in the transmission process. Various parental characteristics and aspects of family structure are found to strengthen the socialization process, with implications for modeling the socialization production function and for policies focused on affecting children's non-cognitive skills.

This paper introduces a new explanation that relies on none of these assumptions: if the cartel's member firms have private information about their costs, price wars can be optimal in the face of complexity. Specifically, equilibria that are robust to pay-off irrelevant disruptions of the information environment generically cannot attain or approximate efficiency. An optimal robust equilibrium must allocate market shares inefficiently and may call for price wars under certain conditions. For a two-firm cartel, cost interdependence is a sufficient condition for price wars to arise in an optimal robust equilibrium. That optimal equilibria are inefficient generically applies not only to collusion games but also to the entire separable pay-off environment--a class that includes most typical economic models.

Strikingly, we show that such collective action policies may increase delay by encouraging free riding on negotiation costs, even while preventing hold-up and reducing total negotiation costs. A calibrated version of the model can account for observed delays and finds that free riding is quantitatively relevant: whereas in simple low-cost debt-restructuring operations, collective mechanisms will reduce delay by more than 60%, in high-cost complicated restructurings, the adoption of such mechanisms results in a doubling of delay.

We show the usefulness of using experimental data to estimate a structural economic model as well as the importance of a structural model in interpreting experimental results. The availability of the experiment also allows us to estimate the program's general equilibrium effects, which we then incorporate into our simulations. Our main findings are (i) the program's grant has a much stronger impact on school enrolment than an equivalent reduction in child wages; (ii) the program has a positive effect on the enrollment of children, especially after primary school; this result is well replicated by the parsimonious structural model; (iii) there are sizeable effects of the program on child wages, which, however, reduce the effectiveness of the program only marginally; and (iv) a revenue neutral change in the program that would increase the grant for secondary school children while eliminating for the primary school children would have a substantially larger effect on enrollment of the latter, while having minor effects on the former.

We conducted laboratory experiments in which subjects could either choose a fair allocation or an unfair allocation or delegate the choice, and we used a punishment option to elicit responsibility attributions. Our results show that, first, responsibility attribution can be effectively shifted and, second, this can constitute a strong motive for the delegation of a decision right.

We base these decompositions on an estimated on-the-job search model that incorporates latent ability, search frictions, firm-worker match quality, human capital accumulation, and endogenous migration between large, medium, and small cities. Counterfactual simulations of the model indicate that variation in returns to experience and differences in wage intercepts across location type are the most important mechanisms contributing to observed city size wage premia. Variation in returns to experience is more important for generating wage premia between large and small locations, while differences in wage intercepts are more important for generating wage premia between medium and small locations. Sorting on unobserved ability within education group and differences in labour market search frictions and distributions of firm-worker match quality contribute little to observed city size wage premia.

To test this prediction, I use new data on political refugees resettled in the U.S. and exploit the fact that these refugees are distributed across cities by a resettlement agency, precluding individuals from sorting. The results indicate that an increase in the number of social network members resettled in the same year or one year prior to a new arrival leads to a deterioration of outcomes, while a greater number of tenured network members improves the probability of employment and raises the hourly wage.

The bargaining environment is described by a set of variables that may affect agents' preferences over the agreement sharing, the status quo outcome, or both. The outcomes (i.e. whether an agreement is reached, and if so the individual shares) and the environment (including the size of the pie) are known, but neither are the agents' utilities nor their threat points. We consider both a deterministic version of the model in which the econometrician observes the shares as deterministic functions of the variables under consideration and a stochastic one in which because of latent disturbances only the joint distribution of incomes and outcomes is recorded. We show that in the most general framework any outcome can be rationalized as a Nash solution. However, even mild exclusion restrictions generate strong implications that can be used to test the Nash bargaining assumption. Stronger conditions further allow to recover the underlying structure of the bargaining, and in particular, the cardinal representation of individual preferences in the absence of uncertainty. An implication of this finding is that empirical works entailing Nash bargaining could (and should) use much more general and robust versions than they usually do.

We consider three cases with respect to the allowable price offers (for shares and for votes when they can be traded separately): unrestricted price offers, quantity-restricted price offers, and price offers contingent on winning. Our main results are characterizations of the equilibria and of the circumstances under which vote buying is harmful. We show that allowing votes to be traded separately of shares results in inefficiencies in all the cases we study. Similarly allowing quantity-restricted offers is also harmful, but allowing conditional offers is not in itself detrimental to efficiency.

It formulates a dynamic general equilibrium model of labour supply, occupational sorting, and human-capital accumulation in which gender discrimination and an earnings gap arise endogenously. It uses this model to quantify the driving forces behind the decline in the gender earnings gap and the increase in female labour-force participation, the proportion of women working in professional occupations, and hours worked. It finds that labour-market experience is the most important factor explaining the gender earnings gap. In addition, statistical discrimination accounts for a large fraction of the observed gender earnings gap and its decline. It also finds that a large increase in aggregate productivity in professional occupations plays a major role in the increase in female labour-force participation, number of hours worked, and the proportion of females working in professional occupations. Although of less importance, demographic changes account for a substantial part of the increase in female labour-force participation and hours worked, whereas home production technology shocks do not.

The key empirical facts are that, on average within narrowly defined sectors, (1) larger plants charge more for their outputs and (2) larger plants pay more for their material inputs. The latter fact generalizes the well-known positive correlation between plant size and wages. Similar correlations hold between prices and export status. We show that the empirical patterns are consistent with a parsimonious extension of the Melitz (2003 , ""The Impact of Trade on Intra-Industry Reallocations and Aggregate Industry Productivity,"" Econometrica, 71, 1695--1725) framework to include endogenous choice of input and output quality. Using a measure of the scope for quality differentiation from Sutton (1998 , Technology and Market Structure: Theory and History. Cambridge: MIT Press), we show that differences across sectors in the relationships between prices and plant size are consistent with our model. Available evidence suggests that differences in observable measures of market power do not provide a complete explanation for the empirical patterns.

Both Q and investment move in the same direction as expected revenue growth, so changes in expected revenue growth induce Q and investment to comove positively. Similarly, shocks to current cash flow, arising from shocks to the user cost of capital in our model, cause investment and cash flow per unit of capital to comove positively. Furthermore, we show that this alternative mechanism for the relationship among investment, Q, and cash flow delivers larger cash flow effects for smaller- and faster-growing firms, as observed in the data. Moreover, the empirically small sensitivity of investment to Tobin's Q does not imply implausibly large adjustment costs in our model (since there are no adjustment costs). Calibrating the model generates values of Q similar to those in the data; investment is more sensitive to cash flow than it is to Q, and both responses are of empirically plausible magnitudes.

We address these questions in the context of high-stakes poker tournaments in which the last few players often negotiate the division of the remaining prize money rather than risk playing the tournament to the end. In 63% of the tournaments in our sample players enter into negotiations, and in 31%, they successfully reach an agreement. We find that the identity of the player who initiates bargaining affects whether a deal is completed but does not affect the terms of the eventual deal. The initiator tends to have a weaker than average position at the table, but the likelihood that a deal will be completed increases in the initiator's strength in the game and history of winning past tournaments. These findings indicate that initiating negotiations conveys information that is relevant to whether a deal will emerge. Nevertheless, initiating bargaining does not affect the initiator's pay-off in a completed deal. Lastly, we find strong evidence that bargaining tends to be initiated and is more likely to be successful when participants' stakes are about equal, consistent with the theoretical work of Cramton, Gibbons and Klemperer (1987, ""Dissolving a Partnership Efficiently"", Econometrica, 55, 615--632).

I show analytically how age dependence improves policy on both the intratemporal and intertemporal margins. I use detailed numerical simulations, calibrated with data from the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics, to generate robust policy implications: age dependence (1) lowers marginal taxes on average and especially on high-income young workers and (2) lowers average taxes on all young workers relative to older workers when private saving and borrowing are restricted. Finally, I calculate and characterize the welfare gains from age dependence. Despite its simplicity, age dependence generates a welfare gain equal to between 0·6% and 1·5% of aggregate annual consumption, and it captures more than 60% of the gain from reform to the dynamic optimal policy. The gains are due to substantial increases in both efficiency and equity. When age dependence is restricted to be Pareto improving, the welfare gain is nearly as large.

We first develop a simple econometric model in which voters choose candidates under uncertainty and rely on endorsements from better informed sources. Newspapers are potentially biased in favour of one of the candidates and voters thus rationally account for the credibility of any endorsements. Our primary empirical finding is that endorsements are influential in the sense that voters are more likely to support the recommended candidate after publication of the endorsement. The degree of this influence, however, depends upon the credibility of the endorsement. In this way, endorsements for the Democratic candidate from left-leaning newspapers are less influential than are endorsements from neutral or right-leaning newspapers and likewise for endorsements for the Republican. We also find that endorsements are more influential among moderate voters and those more likely to be exposed to the endorsement. In sum, these findings suggest that voters do rely on the media for information during campaigns but that the extent of this reliance depends upon the degree and direction of any bias.

We show that this approach is at odds with some of the empirical regularities across and within political systems. We then propose a legislative bargaining model to elucidate this puzzle. In the model, the policies of a confidence-dependent parliamentary government enjoy more predictable support from governing coalition members because their short-term policy goals are less important than the government's survival. Coalition support is stronger when the government has more agenda power and is weaker with a larger ruling coalition.

The presence of complementarities is important for policies that aim to achieve the optimal allocation of resources, e.g. unemployment insurance. We argue that using wage data alone, it is virtually impossible to identify whether assortative matching is positive or negative. Even though we cannot identify the sign of the sorting, we can identify the strength, i.e. the magnitude of the cross-partial and the associated welfare loss. We first show that the wage for a given worker is non-monotonic in the type of his employer. This is due to the fact that in a sorting model, wages reflect the opportunity cost of mismatch. We analytically show that this non-monotonicity prevents standard firm fixed effects to correlate with the true type of the firm. We then propose an alternative procedure that measures the strength of sorting in the presence of search frictions. Knowing the strength of sorting facilitates the measurement of the output loss due to mismatch.

I characterize necessary conditions for equilibrium bidding. The characterization reveals a close relationship between bidding in multiunit auctions and oligopolistic behaviour. I demonstrate that a recently proposed indirect approach to the revenue comparisons of discriminatory and uniform price auctions is not valid if bid functions have steps. In particular, bidders may bid above their marginal valuation in a uniform price auction. In order to demonstrate that discrete bidding can have important consequences for empirical analysis I use my model to examine a data set consisting of individual bids in uniform price treasury auctions of the Czech government. I propose an alternative method for evaluating the performance of the employed mechanism. My results suggest that the uniform price auction performs well, both in terms of efficiency of the allocation and in terms of revenue maximization. I estimate that the employed mechanism failed to extract at most 3 basis points in terms of the annual yield of T-bills worth of expected surplus while implementing an allocation resulting in almost all the efficient surplus. Failing to account for discreteness of bids would in my application result in overestimating the unextracted revenue by more than 50%.

If the shocks that give rise to firm growth are perfectly correlated within a firm, then the growth rates of small and large firms are equally volatile, contrary to what is found in the data. If firm growth is the result of many independent shocks within a firm, it can take hundreds of years for a few large firms to emerge. This paper describes an economy with both types of shocks that can account for the thick-tailed firm size distribution, high entry and exit rates, and the relatively young age of large firms. The economy is one in which aggregate growth is driven by the creation of new products by both new and incumbent firms. Some new firms have better ideas than others and choose to implement those ideas at a more rapid pace. Eventually, such firms slow down when the quality of their ideas reverts to the mean. As in the data, average growth rates in a cross section of firms will appear to be independent of firm size, for all but the smallest firms.

This paper proposes an informal institutional mechanism--the community-based network--through which families belonging to the same neighbourhood or kinship group can bootstrap their way out of such low-skill occupational traps. The insight from the dynamic model that is developed is that once they form, new networks providing mutual support to their members and substituting for inherited parental human capital and wealth will strengthen most rapidly in historically disadvantaged communities, generating a correspondingly high level of intergenerational mobility. These predictions are successfully tested using unique data from India. The analysis in this paper, coupled with an emerging empirical literature on networks and migration, provides a new perspective on mobility in developing countries, with restrictive traditional networks decaying even as new networks supporting collective mobility form and strengthen over time.

It identifies the condition under which countries can restrain the use of concealed barriers based on PTS and establishes that countries will not reduce the cooperative protection level to its minimum attainable level under the optimal PTS. This paper then considers third-party trigger strategies (TTS) under which the WTO allows each country to initiate a punishment phase based on the WTO's judgement about potential violations. By comparing the optimal PTS and optimal TTS, it demonstrates that the WTO facilitates a better cooperative equilibrium by changing the nature of punishment-triggering signals from private to public, which in turn enables countries to use a more efficient punishment, such as an asymmetric and a minimum punishment.

The model shows that low levels of exchange rate pass-through to firm- and aggregate-level import prices coexist with large movements in trade flows.

At the firm level, each producer adjusts its markups depending on its own productivity and the change in the competitive environment generated by the exchange rate movement. Firm-level price responses are asymmetric--different for appreciations and depreciations--and adjustments in the intensive margin of trade (firm-level exports) are substantial.

For the period 1816--2000, Correlates of War data suggest that limited democracies are more aggressive than other regime types, including dictatorships, and not only during periods when the political regime is changing. In particular, a dyad of limited democracies is more likely to be involved in a militarized dispute than any other dyad (including ""mixed"" dyads, where the two countries have different regime types). Thus, while full democratization might advance the cause of peace, limited democratization might advance the cause of war.

Consequently, we find that the correlation between valence and extremist policies rises with office-holder seniority. This result may help explain previous empirical findings. Despite this result, we establish that the whole electorate gains from improvements in the distribution of valences. In contrast, fixing average valence, the greater dispersion in valence associated with a high-valence political elite always benefits the median voter but can harm a majority of voters when voters are sufficiently risk averse. We then consider interest groups (IGs) or activists who search for candidates with better skills.

If preferences, in addition, depend only on the final allocation of consumption in society, the Second Welfare Theorem holds as long as any increase in resources can be distributed in a way that makes all agents better off. The First Welfare Theorem generally does not hold.

Although the evaluator cannot commit ex ante to an acceptance criterion, she decides up front between informed review, where the agent's ability is directly observable, or blind review, where it is not. An ideal acceptance criterion balances the goals of incentive provision and project selection. Relative to this, informed review results in an excessively steep equilibrium acceptance policy: the standard applied to low-ability agents is too stringent and the standard applied to high-ability agents is too lenient. Blind review, in which all types face the same standard, often provides better incentives, but it ignores valuable information for selecting projects. The evaluator prefers a policy of blind (respectively informed) review when the ability distribution puts more weight on high (respectively low) types, the agent's pay-off from acceptance is high (respectively low), or the quality signal is precise (respectively imprecise).

Which are the best in terms of maximin or maximax? We study these questions for the case of a group of individuals faced with a collective choice from a set of alternatives. A key message from our results is that the set of optimal decision rules is well defined, particularly simple, and well known: the class of scoring rules. We provide the optimal scoring rules for the three different ideals of justice under consideration: utilitarianism (efficiency), maximin, and maximax. The optimal utilitarian scoring rule depends crucially on the probability distribution of the utilities. The optimal maximin (respectively maximax) scoring rule takes the optimal utilitarian scoring rule and applies a factor that shifts it towards negative voting (respectively plurality voting).

745,Review of Economic Studies,On the Faustian Dynamics of Policy and Political Power,"['Jinhui Bai', 'Roger Lagunoff']","2011, vol. 78, issue 1, 17-48",[],"Abstract: This paper examines the Faustian dynamics of policy and power. We posit a general class of dynamic games in which current policies affect the future distribution of political power, resulting in the following ""Faustian trade-off"": if the current ruler chooses his preferred policy, he then sacrifices future political power; yet if he wants to preserve his future power, he must sacrifice his present policy objectives. The trade-off comes from the fact that the current political ruler/pivotal voter cannot uncouple the direct effect of his policy from its indirect effect on future power. A policy-endogenous (PE) equilibrium describes this endogenous transfer of power and the resulting evolution of policy and political power over time. We show that the Faustian trade-off in a PE equilibrium is decomposed into two basic rationales. The political preservation effect induces more tempered policy choices than if one's policy choice did not affect one's political fortunes. However, the reformation effect induces ""more aggressive"" policies in order to exploit the productivity gains from policies chosen by even more aggressive successors. We distinguish between political systems that give rise to monotone Faustian dynamics--political power that progressively evolves towards more fiscally liberal types of leaders--and cyclical Faustian dynamics--political power that oscillates between liberal and conservative types of leaders. In each case, we show that the Faustian trade-off moderates the choices of each type of leader.

Like the previous literature, we assume that governments cannot commit to enforce the repayment of debts owed by their citizens. Unlike the previous literature, we assume that governments cannot discriminate between domestic and foreign creditors when enforcing debt payments. This creates novel interactions between domestic and international trade in assets. (i) Increases in domestic trade raise the benefits of enforcement and facilitate international trade. In fact, in our set-up, countries can obtain international risk sharing even in the absence of default penalties. (ii) Increases in foreign trade raise the costs of enforcement and hamper domestic trade. As a result, globalization may worsen domestic risk sharing and lower welfare.

We distinguish between passive traders who hold fixed portfolios of stocks and bonds, and active traders who adjust their portfolios to changes in expected returns. To solve the model, we derive an optimal consumption sharing rule that does not depend on the trading technology, and we derive an aggregation result for state prices. This allows us to solve for equilibrium prices and allocations without having to search for market clearing prices in each asset market separately. We show that the fraction of total wealth held by active traders, not the fraction held by all participants, is critical for asset prices because only these traders respond to variation in state prices and hence absorb the residual aggregate risk created by non-participants. We calibrate the heterogeneity in trading technologies to match the equity premium and the risk-free rate. The calibrated model reproduces the skewness and kurtosis of the wealth distribution in the data. In contrast to existing asset pricing models with heterogeneous agents, our model matches the high volatility of returns and the low volatility of the risk-free rate.

This practice imposes the assumption that there is no within-household inequality. In this paper, we show that ignoring consumption inequality within households produces misleading estimates of inequality along two dimensions. To illustrate this point, we use a collective model of household behaviour to estimate consumption inequality in the U.K. from 1968 to 2001. First, the use of adult equivalence scales underestimates the initial level of cross-sectional consumption inequality by 50%, as large differences in the earnings of husbands and wives translate into large differences in consumption allocations within households. Second, we estimate the rise in between-household inequality has been accompanied by an offsetting reduction in within-household inequality. Our findings also indicate that increases in marital sorting on wages and hours worked can simultaneously explain two-thirds of the decline in within-household inequality and between a quarter and one-half of the rise in between-household inequality for one and two adult households.

755,Review of Economic Studies,Social Learning and Peer Effects in Consumption: Evidence from Movie Sales,['Enrico Moretti'],"2011, vol. 78, issue 1, 356-393",[],"Abstract: Using box-office data for all movies released between 1982 and 2000, I quantify how much the consumption decisions of individuals depend on information they receive from their peers, when quality is ex ante uncertain. In the presence of social learning, we should see different box-office sales dynamics depending on whether opening weekend demand is higher or lower than expected. I use a unique feature of the movie industry to identify ex ante demand expectations: the number of screens dedicated to a movie in its opening weekend reflects the sales expectations held by profit-maximizing theatre owners. Several pieces of evidence are consistent with social learning. First, sales of movies with positive surprise and negative surprise in opening weekend demand diverge over time. If a movie has better than expected appeal and therefore experiences larger than expected sales in Week 1, consumers in Week 2 update upward their expectations of quality, further increasing Week 2 sales. Second, this divergence is small for movies for which consumers have strong priors and large for movies for which consumers have weak priors. Third, the effect of a surprise is stronger for audiences with large social networks. Finally, consumers do not respond to surprises in first-week sales that are orthogonal to movie quality, like weather shocks. Overall, social learning appears to be an important determinant of sales in the movie industry, accounting for 32% of sales for the typical movie with positive surprise. This implies the existence of a large ""social multiplier"" such that the elasticity of aggregate demand to movie quality is larger than the elasticity of individual demand.

This is based on modelling expectations errors directly; we refer to it as synthetic residual estimation (SRE). The flexibility of SRE allows us to account for measurement error in consumption and for heterogeneity in intertemporal allocation parameters. An investigation of the small sample properties of the SRE estimator indicates that it dominates generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation of both exact and approximate Euler equations in the case when we have short panels and noisy consumption data. We apply SRE to two panels drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and estimate the joint distribution of the discount factor and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. We reject strongly homogeneity of the discount factor and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. We find that, on average, the more educated are more patient and less willing to substitute intertemporally than the less educated. Within education strata, patience and willingness to substitute are positively correlated.

The production of human capital requires expenditures and time inputs; the relative importance of these inputs determines the predictions of the theory for inequality both within and across countries. We discipline our quantitative assessment with a calibration firmly grounded on US micro evidence. Since in our calibrated model economy human capital production requires a significant amount of expenditures, TFP changes affect disproportionately the benefits and costs of human capital accumulation. Our main finding is that human capital accumulation strongly amplifies TFP differences across countries: to explain a 20-fold difference in the output per worker, the model requires a 5-fold difference in the TFP of the tradable sector, vs. an 18-fold difference if human capital is fixed across countries.

Wages are determined through Nash bargaining. We also consider aggregate productivity shocks and a complete set of contingent claims conditional on this risk. We use the model to evaluate a tax-financed unemployment insurance scheme. Higher insurance is beneficial for consumption smoothing, but because it raises workers' outside option value, it discourages firm entry. We find that the latter effect is more potent for welfare outcomes; we tabulate the effects quantitatively for different kinds of consumers. We also demonstrate that productivity changes in the model—in steady state as well as stochastic ones—generate rather limited unemployment effects, unless workers are close to indifferent between working and not working; thus, recent findings are corroborated in our more general setting.

In our equilibrium, house prices compensate for cross-sectional productivity differences. We increase productivity dispersion in the calibrated model in order to match the 30-year increase in cross-sectional wage dispersion that we document based on metropolitan-level data. We show that the model quantitatively matches the observed 30-year increase in dispersion of house prices across US metropolitan areas. It is consistent with several other features of the cross-sectional distribution of house prices and wages.

We document two major distinctions between the two sets of guesses: (1) the distribution of guesses made by groups of bettors appears to conform more to the distribution of historical break-up dates than the distribution of guesses made by individual bettors, and (2) the distribution for groups has less mass in its tails and displays lower variability than the distribution for individuals. We argue that these two pieces of evidence are consistent with the hypothesis that group decisions are more moderate, either because groups have to reach a compromise when their members disagree or because individuals with extreme opinions are less likely to be part of a group.

We provide a belief-based formulation of money illusion which accounts for the systematic mistakes in evaluating real and nominal quantities. The impact of money illusion on security prices and their dynamics is demonstrated to be considerable even though its welfare cost on investors is small in typical environments. A money-illusioned investor's real consumption is shown to generally depend on the price level, and specifically to decrease in the price level. A general-equilibrium analysis in the presence of money illusion generates implications that are consistent with several empirical regularities. In particular, the real bond yields and dividend price ratios are positively related to expected inflation, the real short rate is negatively correlated with realized inflation, and money illusion may induce predictability and excess volatility in stock returns. The basic analysis is generalized to incorporate heterogeneous investors with differing degrees of illusion.

We show that equilibrium contracts may be incomplete and assign control rights: they may leave some enforceable future transactions unspecified and instead specify which agent has the right to decide these transactions. Control rights allow the controlling agent to defer time-consuming deliberations on those transactions to a later date, making her less inclined to prolong negotiations over an initial incomplete contract. Still, agents tend to resolve conflicts up-front by writing more complete initial contracts. A more complete contract can take the form of either a finer adaptation to future contingencies, or greater coarseness. Either way, conflicts among contracting agents tend to result in excessively complete contracts in the sense that the maximization of joint payoffs would result in less complete contracts.

I derive a criterion for this general framework that indicates when cycles are welfare-improving in a frictionless economy, and why frictions make cycles more likely to be optimal.

Before this coordination game is played, agents decide to whom they reveal their private information about the state. The information transmission occurring in the cheap-talk communication stage is characterized by a strategic communication network whose links represent truthful information transmission. In equilibrium, whether communication takes place between two agents depends not only on the conflict of interest between these agents, but also on the number and preferences of the other agents with whom they communicate. In particular, communication to a large group of recipients may be feasible even though communication to a small subset of that group may not be. We show that agents who are more central in terms of preference tend to communicate more and to have a greater impact on decisions.

Both sectors are subjected to search and matching frictions in the labour market and wage bargaining. As a result, some of the workers searching for jobs end up being unemployed. Countries are similar except for frictions in their labour markets, such as efficiency of matching and costs of posting vacancies, which can vary across the sectors. The differentiated-product industry has firm heterogeneity and monopolistic competition. We study the interaction of labour market rigidities and trade impediments in shaping welfare, trade flows, productivity, and unemployment. We show that both countries gain from trade. A country with relatively lower frictions in the differentiated-product industry exports differentiated products on net. A country benefits from lowering frictions in its differentiated sector's labour market, but this harms the country's trade partner. Alternatively, a simultaneous, proportional lowering of labour market frictions in the differentiated sectors of both countries benefits both of them. The opening to trade raises a country's rate of unemployment if its relative labour market frictions in the differentiated sector are low, and it reduces the rate of unemployment if its relative labour market frictions in the differentiated sector are high. Cross-country differences in rates of unemployment exhibit rich patterns. In particular, lower labour market frictions do not ensure lower unemployment, and unemployment and welfare can both rise in response to falling labour market frictions and falling trade costs.

We empirically analyse the determinants of incomplete pass-through in the coffee industry. The observed pass-through in this industry replicates key features of pass-through documented in aggregate data: prices respond sluggishly and incompletely to changes in costs. We use microdata on sales and prices to uncover the role of markup adjustment, local costs and barriers to price adjustment in determining incomplete pass-through using a structural oligopoly model that nests all three potential factors. The implied pricing model explains the main dynamic features of short and long-run pass-through. Local costs reduce long-run pass-through (after six quarters) by 59% relative to a Constant Elasticity of Substitution benchmark. Markup adjustment reduces pass-through by an additional 33%, where the extent of markup adjustment depends on the estimated ""super-elasticity"" of demand. The estimated menu costs are small (0.23% of revenue) and have a negligible effect on long-run pass-through but are quantitatively successful in explaining the delayed response of prices to costs. We find that delayed pass-through in the coffee industry occurs almost entirely at the wholesale rather than the retail level.

To do so, we combine data on individual worker productivity from a firm's personnel records with information on each worker's social network of friends in the firm. We find that compared to when she has no social ties with her co-workers, a given worker's productivity is significantly higher when she works alongside friends who are more able than her, and significantly lower when she works with friends who are less able than her. As workers are paid piece rates based on individual productivity, social incentives can be quantified in monetary terms and are such that (i) workers who are more able than their friends are willing to exert less effort and forgo 10% of their earnings; (ii) workers who have at least one friend who is more able than themselves are willing to increase their effort and hence productivity by 10%. The distribution of worker ability is such that the net effect of social incentives on the firm's aggregate performance is positive. The results suggest that firms can exploit social incentives as an alternative to monetary incentives to motivate workers.

We show that this conclusion depends critically on the assumption that the issue being voted on is exogenous, that is, independent of the voting rule used. We depart from the existing literature by endogenizing the proposal that is put to a vote, and establish that under many circumstances unanimity rule makes voters better off. Moreover, in some cases unanimity rule also makes the proposer better off, even when he has diametrically opposing preferences. In this case, unanimity is the Pareto dominant voting rule. Voters prefer unanimity rule because it induces the proposing individual to make a more attractive proposal. The proposing individual prefers unanimity rule because the acceptance probabilities for moderate proposals are higher. We apply our results to jury trials and debt restructuring.

This answer raises another question: How then do countries absorb changes in factor endowments? The data show that in both the short and long runs, an increase in the supply of a production factor reduces its rate of return and makes it more intensively used in all sectors of the economy: changes in production techniques. In the long run, the point estimate is that the reduction in the rate of return is more than 50% larger than in the short run.

Specifically, why is it that car rental companies do not offer customers the option of renting older cars at a discount, instead of offering only relatively new cars at full price? We also tackle a related puzzle: why do car rental companies trade-in their vehicles so early? Most US companies purchase brand new rental cars and replace them after 2 years or when their odometer exceeds 34,000 km. That is a very costly strategy due to the well-known by rapid depreciation in used car prices. We show that in a competitive rental market, prices are a declining function of odometer and cars are rented over their full economic lifespan. Our solution to these puzzles is that actual rental markets are not fully competitive and firms may be behaving suboptimally. We provide a case study of a large car rental company that provided us access to its operating data. We develop a model of the company's operations that predicts that the company can significantly increase its profits by keeping its rental cars twice as long as it currently does, discounting the rental prices of older vehicles to induce its customers to rent them. The company undertook an experiment to test our model's predictions. We report initial findings from this experiment which involved over 4500 rentals of over 500 cars in 4 locations over a 5-month period. The results are consistent with the predictions of our model, and suggest that a properly chosen declining rental price function can increase overall revenues. Profits also increase significantly, since doubling the holding period of rental cars cuts discounted replacement costs by nearly 40%.

A model of firm behaviour based on separability allows derivation of the labour demand elasticity with respect to service offshoring for each occupation. Estimation is performed with quasi-maximum likelihood, to account for high degrees of censoring in the employment variable. The estimated elasticities are then related to proxies for the skill level and the degree of tradability of the occupations. Results suggest that service offshoring is skill-biased, because it increases employment in more skilled occupations relative to less skilled occupations.

Productivity is subject to publicly observed aggregate shocks, and to idiosyncratic shocks that are seen only by the employer. It is shown that there is a unique equilibrium, provided that the idiosyncratic shocks are not too large. The main result is that small fluctuations in productivity that are privately observed by employers can give rise to a kind of wage stickiness in equilibrium, and the informational rents associated with this stickiness are sufficient to generate relatively large unemployment fluctuations.

Its contribution is two-fold. It first shows that the better the firms' corporate governance and the stronger their balance sheet, the more closely taxes should track the corresponding externality. It then develops the first analysis of extended liability when guarantors themselves may be judgement-proof, and the extension of liability may give rise to further externalities. Relatedly, it derives the curvature of the optimal taxation of externalities in a multi-plant firm.

When signals are serially correlated, the individual typically under-reacts to short streaks, over-reacts to longer ones, and under-reacts to very long ones. Our model has implications for a number of puzzles in finance, e.g. the active-fund and fund-flow puzzles, and the presence of momentum and reversal in asset returns.

The best assets to acquire information about are ones the investor expects to hold. But the assets the investor holds depend on the information he observes. We build a framework to solve jointly for investment and information choices, with general preferences and information cost functions. Although the optimal research strategies depend on preferences and costs, the main result is that the investor who can first collect information systematically deviates from holding a diversified portfolio. Information acquisition can rationalize investing in a diversified fund and a concentrated set of assets, an allocation often observed, but usually deemed anomalous.

This paper departs from this framework by assuming that a rent-seeking politician chooses policies. If the politician chooses extractive policies, citizens throw him out of power. We analyse the efficient sustainable equilibrium. Unlike in the standard economy, temporary economic shocks generate volatile and persistent changes in taxes along the equilibrium path. This serves to optimally limit rent-seeking by the politician and to optimally generate support for the politician from the citizens. Taxes resembling those of the benevolent government are very costly since the government over-saves and resources are wasted on rents. Political distortions thus cause the complete debt market to behave as if it were incomplete. However, in contrast to an incomplete market economy, in the long run, taxes do not converge to zero, and under some conditions, they resemble taxes under a benevolent government.

What is the correct notion of efficiency to use? To address these issues, this paper develops an extension of the notion of Pareto efficiency, referred to as Millian efficiency, to evaluate symmetric allocations in an overlapping generations setting with endogenous fertility. This extension is based on preferences of those agents who are actually alive, and exclusively allows for welfare comparisons of symmetric allocations. First, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions to determine whether an allocation is Millian efficient or not, and we show that the sufficient conditions for dynamic efficiency offered by Cass (1972) and Balasko and Shell (1980) cannot be directly applied when fertility decisions are endogenous. Second, we characterize Millian efficient allocations as the equilibria of a decentralized price mechanism, and we present a sufficient condition for dynamic efficiency that uses the sequence of prices associated to such decentralized equilibria. Finally, we analyse how intergenerational policies should be designed to restore efficiency and achieve net welfare gains in two different settings in which markets yield inefficient allocations: dynamic inefficiencies and financial market incompleteness regarding human capital. In the former, a pay-as-you-go social security system eliminates dynamic inefficiencies, provided pensions are explicitly linked with fertility decisions. In the latter, a specific link between social security and public education becomes a necessary condition for Millian efficiency.

Information on aggregate productivity is dispersed across agents and there are two aggregate shocks: a standard productivity shock and a ""noise shock"" affecting public beliefs about aggregate productivity. Neither the central bank nor individual agents can distinguish the two shocks when they are realized. Despite the lack of superior information, monetary policy can affect the economy's relative response to the two shocks. As time passes, better information on past fundamentals becomes available. The central bank can then adopt a backward-looking policy rule, based on more precise information about past shocks. By announcing its response to future information, the central bank can influence the expected real interest rate faced by forward-looking consumers with different beliefs and thus affect the equilibrium allocation. If the announced future response is sufficiently aggressive, the central bank can completely eliminate the effect of noise shocks. However, this policy is typically suboptimal, as it leads to an excessively compressed distribution of relative prices. The optimal monetary policy balances the benefits of aggregate stabilization with the costs in terms of cross-sectional efficiency.

Taking preferences over acts as a primitive, we axiomatize Quantile Maximization in a Savage setting. Our axiomatization also provides a novel derivation of subjective beliefs, which demonstrates that neither the monotonicity nor the continuity conditions assumed in the literature are essential for probabilistic sophistication. We characterize preferences of quantile maximizers towards downside risk.

A trade reform is often deemed beneficial because the elimination of trade barriers allows labour to reallocate towards those sectors in the economy in which the country has a comparative advantage. The amount and speed of the reallocation, however, and the post-reform behaviour of output, productivity and welfare, will depend on how regulated the labour market is. First, I document that high firing costs slow down the intersectoral reallocation of labour after a trade reform. Second, in order to isolate the effect of firing costs on labour reallocation, output and welfare after a trade reform, I build a dynamic general equilibrium model. I find that if a country does not liberalize its labour market at the outset of its trade reform, the intersectoral reallocation of workers will be 30% slower, and as much as 30% of the gains in real output and labour productivity in the years following the trade reform will be lost. From a policy standpoint, the message is that while trade reforms are desirable, they need to be complemented by labour market reforms in order to be fully successful.

We allow not only for the cross-sectional dependencies of innovations, but also for the presence of co-integration across cross-sectional levels. Unbalanced panels and panels with differing individual short-run dynamics and cross-sectionally related dynamics are also permitted. We also more carefully formulate the unit root hypotheses in panels. In particular, using order statistics, we make it possible to test for and against the presence of unit roots in some of the individual units for a given panel. The individual IV t-ratios, which are the bases of our tests, are asymptotically and normally distributed and cross-sectionally independent. Therefore, the critical values of the order statistics as well as the usual average statistic can be easily obtained from simple elementary probability computations. We show via a set of simulations that our tests work well, whereas other existing tests fail to perform properly. As an illustration, we apply our tests to the panels of real exchange rates, and find no evidence for the purchasing power parity hypothesis, which is in sharp contrast with the previous studies.

For I find myself not doing what I really want to do but doing what I really loathe."" Saint PaulWhat behaviour can be explained using the hypothesis that the agent faces temptation but is otherwise a ""standard rational agent""? In earlier work, Gul and Pesendorfer (2001) use a set betweenness axiom to restrict the set of preferences considered by Dekel, Lipman and Rustichini (2001) to those explainable via temptation. We argue that set betweenness rules out plausible and interesting forms of temptation including some which may be important in applications. We propose a pair of alternative axioms called DFC, desire for commitment, and AIC, approximate improvements are chosen. DFC characterizes temptation as situations in which given any set of alternatives, the agent prefers committing herself to some particular item from the set rather than leaving herself the flexibility of choosing later. AIC is based on the idea that if adding an option to a menu improves the menu, it is because that option is chosen under some circumstances. From this interpretation, the axiom concludes that if an improvement is worse (as a commitment) than some commitment from the menu, then the best commitment from the improved menu is strictly preferred to facing that menu. We show that these axioms characterize a natural generalization of the Gul-Pesendorfer representation.

Imperfect observability generates an incentive for candidates to offer excessive transfers even if voters are homogeneous and taxation is distortionary. Government spending is larger than in a world of perfect observability. Transfers are partly financed through government debt, and the size of the debt is higher in less transparent political systems. The model provides an explanation of fiscal churning; it also predicts that groups whose transfers are less visible to others receive higher transfers, and that imperfect transparency of transfers may lead to underprovision of public goods. From the policy perspective, the main novelty of our analysis is a separate evaluation of the transparency of spending and the transparency of revenues. We show that the transparency of the political system does not unambiguously improve efficiency: transparency of spending is beneficial, but transparency of revenues can be counterproductive because it endogenously leads to increased wasteful spending.

Wage rates are only observed for those who are employed, and employment status itself may be affected by the training program. This paper develops an intuitive trimming procedure for bounding average treatment effects in the presence of sample selection. In contrast to existing methods, the procedure requires neither exclusion restrictions nor a bounded support for the outcome of interest. Identification results, estimators, and their asymptotic distribution are presented. The bounds suggest that the program raised wages, consistent with the notion that the Job Corps raises earnings by increasing human capital, rather than solely through encouraging work. The estimator is generally applicable to typical treatment evaluation problems in which there is nonrandom sample selection/attrition.

We show that estimates of the effects of twinning at higher parities on the outcomes of older children in prior studies do not identify family-size effects but are confounded by inter-child allocation effects because of the endowment deficit and close spacing of twins. However, examining the effects of twinning by birth order, net of the effects stemming from the endowment deficit of twins, can provide upper and lower bounds on the trade-off between the family size and average child quality. Our estimates, based on data from China, indicate that an extra child at parity one or at parity two, net of one component of birth-endowment effects associated with birth weight, significantly decreases the schooling progress, the expected college enrolment, grades in school and the assessed health of all children in the family. Despite the evident significant trade-off between number of children and child quality in China, the findings suggest that the contribution of the one-child policy in China to the development of its human capital was modest.

Sample data and model-simulated data are smoothed with the same kernel, which considerably simplifies bandwidth selection for the purpose of implementing the estimator. Furthermore, the SNE displays the same asymptotic efficiency properties as the maximum-likelihood estimator as soon as the model is Markov in the observable variables.

We first document that firms producing capital goods face a higher level of idiosyncratic risk than their counterparts producing consumption goods. In a model of capital accumulation where the protection of investors' rights is incomplete, this difference in risk induces a wedge between the returns on investment in the two sectors. The wedge is bigger, the poorer the investor protection. In turn, this implies that countries endowed with weaker institutions face higher relative prices of investment goods, invest a lower fraction of their income, and end up being poorer.

Government ownership is more efficient than private ownership when private property rights are insecure. Improved institutional protection of property rights over time creates the need to privatize. The buyer's financial constraints affect the timing of privatization, causing the firm's post-privatization performance either to improve or to deteriorate in the short run. Financial constraints also have the possibility of inducing an underpricing phenomenon during privatization where the firm is priced below both what the buyer is willing to pay and the buyer's ability to pay. Faster institutional development calls for earlier privatization, but it also has the potential to either create or exacerbate deadweight losses associated with inefficient privatization.

We argue that openness can increase the size of governments through two channels: (1) a terms-of-trade externality, whereby trade lowers the domestic cost of taxation, and (2) the demand for insurance, whereby trade raises risk and public transfers. We provide a unified framework for studying and testing these two mechanisms. Our main theoretical prediction is that the relative strength of the two explanations depends on a key parameter, namely, the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods. Moreover, while the first mechanism is inefficient from the standpoint of world welfare, the second, instead, is optimal. In the empirical part of the paper, we provide new evidence on the positive association between openness and government size and we explore its determinants. Consistent with the terms-of-trade externality channel, we show that the correlation is contingent on a low elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods. Our findings raise warnings that globalization may have led to inefficiently large governments.

We are motivated by our empirical findings that human capital is occupation specific and that the fraction of workers switching occupations in the U.S. was as high as 16% a year in the early 1970's and had increased to 21% by the mid-1990's. We develop a general equilibrium model with occupation-specific human capital and heterogeneous experience levels within occupations. We find that the model, calibrated to match the level of occupational mobility in the 1970's, accounts quite well for the level of (within-group) wage inequality in that period. Next, we find that the model, calibrated to match the increase in occupational mobility, accounts for over 90% of the increase in wage inequality between the 1970's and the 1990's. The theory is also quantitatively consistent with the level and increase in the short-term variability of earnings.

Both have intrinsic preferences over projects. This paper models the costs and benefits of divergence between their preferences, that is, dissent within the organization. Dissent is useful to (1) foster the use of objective (and sometimes private) information in decision making and (2) give credibility to the Decision Maker's choices. However, dissent comes at the cost of hurting the Implementer's intrinsic motivation, thereby impairing organizational efficiency. We show that dissent can be optimal, in particular, when information is useful and uncertainty is high. Moreover, dissent remains an optimal organizational form even when Implementers can choose their employer or when Decision Makers have real authority over hiring decisions.

I study the effects of these imperfections when talent is industry-specific; it can only be revealed on the job, and once learnt becomes public information. I show that firms bid excessively for the pool of incumbent workers at the expense of trying out new talent. The workforce is then plagued with an unfavourable selection of individuals: there are too many mediocre workers, whose talent is not high enough to justify them crowding out novice workers with lower expected talent but with more upside potential. The result is an inefficiently low level of output coupled with higher wages for known high talents. This problem is most severe where information about talent is initially very imprecise and the complementary costs of production are high. I argue that high incomes in professions such as entertainment, management, and entrepreneurship, may be explained by the nature of the talent revelation process, rather than by an underlying scarcity of talent.

Optimal policy generates long-run cycles in both sovereign debt and foreign direct investment in an environment in which the first best capital stock is a constant. The expected tax on capital endogenously varies with the state of the economy, and investment is distorted by more in recessions than in booms, amplifying the effect of shocks. The government's lack of commitment induces a negative correlation between investment and the stock of government debt, a ""debt overhang"" effect.

For this purpose, we use a representative three-year panel, the French Labour Force Survey. We develop a model of earnings dynamics that combines a flexible specification of marginal earnings distributions (to fit the large cross-sectional dimension of the data) with a tight parametric representation of the dynamics (adapted to the short time-series dimension). Log earnings are modelled as the sum of a deterministic component, an individual fixed effect and a transitory component which is assumed first-order Markov. The transition probability of the transitory component is modelled as a one-parameter Plackett copula. We estimate this model using a sequential expectation-maximization algorithm.We exploit the estimated model to study employment/earnings inequality in France over the 1990-2002 period. We show that, in phase with business-cycle fluctuations (a recession in 1993 and two peaks in 1990 and 2000), earnings mobility decreases when cross-section inequality and unemployment risk increase. We simulate individual earnings trajectories and compute present values of lifetime earnings for various horizons. Inequality presents a hump-shaped evolution over the period, with a 9% increase between 1990 and 1995 and a decrease afterwards. Accounting for unemployment yields an increase of 11%. Moreover, this increase is persistent, as it translates into a 12% increase in the variance of log present values. The ratio of inequality in present values to inequality in one-year earnings, a natural measure of immobility or of the persistence of inequality, remains remarkably constant over the business cycle.

We find that the firm's incentive scheme has a large effect on productivity, raising it by 12% over the sample period for the average worker. Using our parameter estimates, we show that the cost of increased effort due to incentives is equal to the dollar value of a 5% rise in productivity. Welfare is measured as the output produced minus the cost of effort; hence, the net increase in the average worker's welfare due to the introduction of the firm's bonus plan is 7%.

Despite the multiplicity of equilibria in the coordination games, aggregate behaviour is fairly predictable. The pure or mixed Nash equilibria cannot describe subjects' behaviour. We present two global games with private information about monetary payoffs and about risk aversion. While previous literature treats the parameters of a global game as given, we estimate them and show that both models describe observed behaviour well. The global-game selection for vanishing noise of private signals offers a good recommendation for actual players, given the observed distribution of actions.

If knowledge accumulates as technology advances, then successive generations of innovators may face an increasing educational burden. Innovators can compensate through lengthening educational phases and narrowing expertise, but these responses come at the cost of reducing individual innovative capacities, with implications for the organization of innovative activity—a greater reliance on teamwork—and negative implications for growth. Building on this ""burden of knowledge"" mechanism, this paper first presents six facts about innovator behaviour. I show that age at first invention, specialization, and teamwork increase over time in a large micro-data set of inventors. Furthermore, in cross-section, specialization and teamwork appear greater in deeper areas of knowledge, while, surprisingly, age at first invention shows little variation across fields. A model then demonstrates how these facts can emerge in tandem. The theory further develops explicit implications for economic growth, providing an explanation for why productivity growth rates did not accelerate through the 20th century despite an enormous expansion in collective research effort. Upward trends in academic collaboration and lengthening doctorates, which have been noted in other research, can also be explained in this framework. The knowledge burden mechanism suggests that the nature of innovation is changing, with negative implications for long-run economic growth.

If an employer's private learning is reflected in a worker's wage and one employer's private information is transmitted to the next when the worker makes a job-to-job transition, then asymmetric employer learning will appear in wage regressions as learning over an employment spell. Extending previous work that assumes all learning takes place publicly, this paper develops wage regressions that test for both asymmetric employer learning and public learning. The empirical results, including tests of alternative explanations, are consistent with asymmetric employer learning's having at least as much of an effect on wages during an employment spell as does public learning. The model developed in this paper illustrates how the story suggested by the empirical work might unfold. It shows that outside firms can profitably compete with a better-informed employer through bidding wars, even when the worker is equally productive in all firms. Furthermore, this competition results in different wages for workers with the same publicly observable characteristics, a result that previous models of asymmetric learning have not produced.

In an economy in which investors are price takers and risk-neutral, and absent any insider trading or other transaction costs, we show that risky assets command an excess expected return over safe assets in the presence of learning by holding. This is reminiscent of the ""credit spread puzzle""—the large spread between BBB-rated and AAA-rated corporate bonds that is not explained by historical defaults, risk aversion, or trading frictions. The intuition is that the seller of a risky bond needs to offer a ""coordination premium"" that helps potential buyers overcome their fear of future illiquidity. Absent this premium, this fear could become self-justified in the presence of learning by holding because a future lemons problem deters current market participation, and this in turn vindicates the fear of a future lemons problem.

Each individual is endowed with a level of political power. The ruling coalition consists of a subset of the individuals in the society and decides the distribution of resources. A ruling coalition needs to contain enough powerful members to win against any alternative coalition that may challenge it, and it needs to be self-enforcing, in the sense that none of its subcoalitions should be able to secede and become the new ruling coalition. We present both an axiomatic approach that captures these notions and determines a (generically) unique ruling coalition and the analysis of a dynamic game of coalition formation that encompasses these ideas. We establish that the subgame-perfect equilibria of the coalition formation game coincide with the set of ruling coalitions resulting from the axiomatic approach. A key insight of our analysis is that a coalition is made self-enforcing by the failure of its winning subcoalitions to be self-enforcing. This is most simply illustrated by the following example: with ""majority rule"", two-person coalitions are generically not self-enforcing and consequently, three-person coalitions are self-enforcing (unless one player is disproportionately powerful). We also characterize the structure of ruling coalitions. For example, we determine the conditions under which ruling coalitions are robust to small changes in the distribution of power and when they are fragile. We also show that when the distribution of power across individuals is relatively equal and there is majoritarian voting, only certain sizes of coalitions (e.g. with majority rule, coalitions of size 1, 3, 7, 15, etc.) can be the ruling coalition.

Overall, a first-born daughter is significantly less likely to be living with her father compared to a first-born son. Three factors are important in explaining this gap. First, women with first-born daughters are less likely to marry. Strikingly, we also find evidence that the gender of a child in utero affects shotgun marriages. Among women who have taken an ultrasound test during pregnancy, mothers who have a girl are less likely to be married at delivery than those who have a boy. Second, parents who have first-born girls are significantly more likely to be divorced. Third, after a divorce, fathers are much more likely to obtain custody of sons compared to daughters. These three factors have serious negative income and educational consequences for affected children. What explains these findings? In the last part of the paper, we turn to the relationship between child gender and fertility to help sort out parental gender bias from competing explanations for our findings. We show that the number of children is significantly higher in families with a first-born girl. Our estimates indicate that first-born daughters caused approximately 5500 more births per year, for a total of 220,000 more births over the past 40 years. Taken individually, each piece of empirical evidence is not sufficient to establish the existence of parental gender bias. But taken together, the weight of the evidence supports the notion that parents in the U.S. favour boys over girls.

Such feelings can affect the choice between lotteries that will be played out in the future—choice may be motivated not only by the (static) risks involved but also by the desire to reduce anxiety or to promote savouring. This paper provides a model of preference in a three-period setting that is axiomatic and includes a role for anticipatory feelings. It is shown that the model of preference can accommodate intuitive patterns of demand for information such as information seeking when a favourable outcome is very likely and information aversion when it is more likely that the outcome will be unfavourable. Behavioural meaning is given to statements such as ""individual 1 is anxious"" and ""2 is more anxious than 1"".

In making this determination, each bank is in competition with other banks, but without knowing the competitor banks' credit standards. The resulting unique form of competition leads to endogenous credit cycles, periodic ""credit crunches"". Empirical tests of this repeated bank lending game are constructed based on parameterizing public information about relative bank performance that is at the root of banks' beliefs about rival banks' lending standards. The relative performance of rival banks has predictive power for subsequent lending in the credit card market, where we can identify the main competitors. At the macroeconomic level, the relative bank performance of commercial and industrial loans is an autonomous source of macroeconomic fluctuations. In an asset pricing context, the relative bank performance is a priced risk factor for both banks and non-financial firms. The factor coefficients for non-financial firms are decreasing with size, consistent with smaller firms being more bank dependent.

The results show that, contrary to the common intuition, the performance differential between centralized and decentralized decision-making is non-monotone in the importance of coordination. Further, both these common structures are dominated by asymmetric structures in sufficiently asymmetric environments (such as a small division developing a new product in the presence of a large division with an established product).

In this environment, I find that office-motivated candidates are favoured in electoral competition but that their advantage is limited by the electoral mechanism itself and policy-motivated candidates win a significant fraction of elections. More importantly, I show that the competitive interaction among candidates of different motivations affects the incentives of all candidates—both office and policy motivated—and that this competition affects policy outcomes.

The data sets from the two tasks are largely inconsistent. Rather, we find evidence that the subjects perceive the games differently when they (i) choose actions and (ii) state beliefs—their stated beliefs reveal deeper strategic thinking than their actions. On average, they fail to best respond to their own stated beliefs in almost half of the games. The inconsistency is confirmed by estimates of a unified statistical model that jointly uses the actions and the belief statements.

Using detailed plot-level data from rural Pakistan, we find that non-contractible investment is underprovided on tenanted land, even after controlling for the endogeneity of leasing decisions. Our evidence also indicates that moral hazard in investment effort alone cannot explain this inefficiency. Instead, imperfect commitment appears to be the driving mechanism, since even plots taken on fixed rent contracts where all the rent is paid upfront receive lower investment than owner-cultivated plots. We further show that a considerable portion of the variation in tenancy duration, and hence in the security of tenure, is due to heterogeneity across landlords. One interpretation of this finding is that landlord reputation is important in mitigating hold-up.

In particular, it shows that competitive financial contracts can result in excessive borrowing ex ante and excessive volatility ex post. Even though from a first-best perspective the equilibrium always displays under-borrowing, from a second-best point of view excessive borrowing can arise. The inefficiency is due to the combination of limited commitment in financial contracts and the fact that asset prices are determined in a spot market. This generates a pecuniary externality that is not internalized in private contracts. The model provides a framework to evaluate preventive policies, which can be used during a credit boom to reduce the expected costs of a financial crisis.

We show that the conventional wisdom that trade promotes peace is only partially true even in a model where trade is economically beneficial, military conflicts reduce trade, and leaders are rational. When war can occur because of the presence of asymmetric information, the probability of escalation is lower for countries that trade more bilaterally because of the opportunity cost associated with the loss of trade gains. However, countries more open to global trade have a higher probability of war because multilateral trade openness decreases bilateral dependence to any given country and the cost of a bilateral conflict. We test our predictions on a large data set of military conflicts on the 1950-2000 period. Using different strategies to solve the endogeneity issues, including instrumental variables, we find robust evidence for the contrasting effects of bilateral and multilateral trade openness. For proximate countries, we find that trade has had a surprisingly large effect on their probability of military conflict.

We study the optimal exit policy and show that from a normative standpoint, the KFG rule is generally suboptimal. We consider a model in which the fixed exchange rate regime has become unsustainable due to an unexpected increase in government spending. We show that when there are no exit costs, it is optimal to abandon immediately. When there are exit costs, the optimal abandonment time is a decreasing function of the size of the fiscal shock. For large fiscal shocks, immediate abandonment is optimal.

We show how our theory naturally leads to an identification procedure, which allows us to recover the moments of the unobserved noise; this procedure may be useful in other applications.

Where these conditions hold, we show how information may be recovered on individual consumers' marginal valuations of product attributes. In some cases, marginal valuations are point identified, and in other cases, we can only recover bounds. Where the conditions fail, we highlight the role which the introduction of unobserved product attributes can play in rationalizing the data.

Consumers' ability to delay creates an asymmetry in the optimal price path, which exhibits fast increases and slow decreases. This asymmetry creates an upward bias in the level of prices, pushing them above the price charged by a firm facing the average level of demand.

Strong wealth effects in response to shocks raise the demand for domestic goods above supply, crowding out external demand and appreciating the terms of trade and the RER. Building upon the literature on incomplete markets, we then show that similar results are obtained when productivity shocks are nearly permanent, provided the trade elasticity is set equal to the high values consistent with micro-estimates. Under both approaches the model accounts for the low and negative correlation between the RER and relative (domestic to foreign) consumption in the data—the ""Backus-Smith puzzle"".

We focus on one-sided incomplete information, in which one bidder learns the objects' value, which itself does not change over time. Learning by the uninformed bidder occurs only through observation of the bids. The proprietary information is eventually revealed, and the seller extracts essentially the entire rent (for large discount factors). Both players' pay-offs tend to 0 as the discount factor tends to 1. However, the uninformed bidder does relatively better than the informed bidder. We discuss the case of two-sided incomplete information and argue that, under a Markovian refinement, the outcome is pooling as information is revealed only insofar as it does not affect prices.

Firms conduct FDI by either engaging in greenfield investment or in cross-border acquisitions. Cross-border acquisitions involve firms trading heterogeneous corporate assets to exploit complementarities, while greenfield FDI involves setting up a new production division in the foreign country. In equilibrium, greenfield FDI and cross-border acquisitions coexist within the same industry, but the composition of FDI between these modes varies with firm and country characteristics. Firms engaging in greenfield investment are systematically more efficient than those engaging in cross-border acquisitions. Furthermore, most FDI takes the form of cross-border acquisitions when production-cost differences between countries are small, while greenfield investment plays a more important role for FDI from high-cost into low-cost countries.

The weakness of this approach is that the fundamental question of who has the opportunity to commit cannot be addressed, as it is assumed. This paper presents a framework in which commitment power arises endogenously from the fundamentals of the model. We construct a finite dynamic game in which players are given the option to change their minds as often as they wish, but pay a switching cost if they do so. We show that for games with two players and two actions there is a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium with a simple structure. This equilibrium is independent of the order and timing of moves and is robust to other protocol specifications. Moreover, despite the perfect information nature of the model and the costly switches, strategic delays may arise in equilibrium. The flexibility of the model allows us to apply it to various environments. In particular, we study an entry deterrence situation. Its equilibrium is intuitive and illustrative of how commitment power is endogenously determined.

This paper identifies a limitation inherent in this role of prices. It shows that the presence of a feedback effect from the financial market to the real value of a firm creates an incentive for an uninformed trader to sell the firm's stock. When this happens the informativeness of the stock price decreases, and the beneficial allocational role of the financial market weakens. The trader profits from this trading strategy, partly because his trading distorts the firm's investment. We therefore refer to this strategy as manipulation. We show that trading without information is profitable only with sell orders, driving a wedge between the allocational implications of buyer and seller initiated speculation, and providing justification for restrictions on short sales.

In this paper, I empirically analyse a contractual innovation in the vertically separated video rental industry. Prior to 1998, video stores obtained inventory from movie distributors using simple linear-pricing contracts. In 1998, revenue-sharing contracts were widely adopted. I investigate the effect of the introduction of revenue-sharing contracts on firms' profits and consumer welfare. I analyse a new panel data set of home video retailers that includes information on individual retailers' contract and inventory choices, as well as rentals and contract terms for 246 movie titles and 6137 retailers in the U.S. during each week of 1998 and 1999 and the first half of 2000. A structural econometric model of firms' behaviour is developed that describes the nature of firms' contract choices. Estimates from this model indicate that both upstream and downstream profits increase by 10% under the revenue-sharing contract for popular titles. For less popular titles, the effects can be even larger. I also estimate that consumers benefit when revenue-sharing contracts are adopted.

In our model, market size and trade affect the toughness of competition, which then feeds back into the selection of heterogeneous producers and exporters in that market. Aggregate productivity and average mark-ups thus respond to both the size of a market and the extent of its integration through trade (larger, more integrated markets exhibit higher productivity and lower mark-ups). Our model remains highly tractable, even when extended to a general framework with multiple asymmetric countries integrated to different extents through asymmetric trade costs.

In particular, we examine that conjecture in a model where there is a vanishingly small cost for production (or sales) capacity, and the seller may augment capacity in every period. In the ""gap case"", any positive capacity cost ensures that in the limit, as the size of the gap and the time between sales periods shrink, the monopolist obtains profits identical to those that would prevail when she could commit ex ante to a fixed capacity.

To address this question, we develop a model with vintage capital and search-matching frictions where irreversible investment in new vintages of capital creates heterogeneity in productivity among firms, matched as well as vacant. We demonstrate that capital-embodied technological change reduces labour demand and raises equilibrium unemployment and unemployment durations. In addition, the presence of labour-market regulations (unemployment benefits, payroll taxes, and firing costs) exacerbates these effects. Thus, the model is qualitatively consistent with some key features of the European labour-market experience relative to that of the U.S.: it features a sharper rise in unemployment and a sharper fall in the vacancy rate and the labour share.

The construction of a consensus probability belief, as well as a consensus consumer, is shown to be valid modulo an aggregation bias, which takes the form of a discount factor. In classical cases, the consensus probability belief is a risk tolerance weighted average of the individual beliefs, and the discount factor is proportional to beliefs dispersion. This discount factor makes the heterogeneous beliefs setting fundamentally different from the homogeneous beliefs setting, and it is consistent with the interpretation of beliefs heterogeneity as a source of risk.We then use our construction to rewrite in a simple way the equilibrium characteristics (market price of risk, risk premium, risk-free rate) in a heterogeneous beliefs framework and to analyse the impact of beliefs heterogeneity. Finally, we show that it is possible to construct specific parametrizations of the heterogeneous beliefs model that lead to globally higher risk premia and lower risk-free rates.

What reporting protocol elicits the most information?

The signals differ in initial quality and, unlike previous work, differ in quality improvement. The paper finds that “mind changes” (inconsistent reports) can signal talent if a smart agent improves faster. Also, sequential reports dominate when the principal's decision is very sensitive to information; a single report dominates if the mediocre agent's signals improve faster or the agent is likely mediocre.

The labour market is subject to search frictions, and the existing productive units may fail to adopt the most recent technological advances. Technological progress can lead to the destruction of technologically obsolete jobs and cause unemployment. We calibrate the model to replicate the high persistence that characterizes the dynamics of firms' neutral technology and the frequency of firms' capital adjustment. We find that neutral technological advances increase job destruction and job reallocation and reduce aggregate employment. Investment-specific technological advances reduce job destruction, have mild effects on job creation, and are expansionary. Hence, neutral technological progress prompts Schumpeterian creative destruction, while investment-specific technological progress operates essentially as in the standard neoclassical growth model. Using structural VAR models, we provide support to the key dynamic implications of the model.

The fear of falling under an equally inefficient and venal ruler that favours another group is enough to discipline supporters. The model predicts extensive use of patronage, ethnic bias in taxation, and spending patterns and unveils a new mechanism through which economic frictions translate into increased rent extraction by the leader.

It first describes thought experiments, dynamic variants of those provided by Ellsberg, that highlight a sense in which the Bayesian learning model is extreme—it models agents who are implausibly ambitious about what they can learn in complicated environments. The paper then provides a generalization of the Bayesian model that accommodates the intuitive choices in the thought experiments. In particular, the model allows decision-makers' confidence about the environment to change—along with beliefs—as they learn. A portfolio choice application compares the effect of changes in confidence under ambiguity vs. changes in estimation risk under Bayesian learning.

In addition, the uncertainty about future productivity shocks and the ability of firms to modify the scale of their operations also influence location choice. In particular, we show that locating in clusters is preferred when training costs are borne by workers and when firm-specific productivity shocks can potentially be large.

These bandwagons are driven by a combination of beliefs and the desire of voters to vote for the winning candidate. Significantly, in this equilibrium the pivot probability for each voter is non-zero, even in an infinite population. Consequently, the bandwagons do not always start after one (or at most two) favourable decisions (as do economic cascades) and varying levels of informative voting are observed, consistent with observations from sequential voting in U.S. presidential primaries. Further, voters are exposed to counterintuitive incentives, referred to as “buyers' remorse”, that have been attributed to real primary voters.I also derive equilibrium behaviour in this environment when voting is simultaneous and compare the quality of information aggregation within each mechanism. I relate the conclusions to U.S. presidential primaries and find they are consistent with a common conclusion about the front-loading of the primary process: that in tight elections (with no front-runner) simultaneous voting is preferred, whereas in lopsided elections sequential voting is preferred. The superior performance of sequential voting in lopsided races is precisely because bandwagons occur.

Matched individuals may observe the opponents' preferences perfectly, not at all, or with some in-between probability. When preferences are observable, a stable outcome must be efficient. When they are not observable, a stable outcome must be a Nash equilibrium and all strict equilibria are stable. We show that, for pure-strategy outcomes, these conclusions are robust to allowing almost perfect, and almost no, observability, with the notable exception that inefficient strict equilibria may fail to be stable with any arbitrarily small degree of observability (despite being stable with no observability).

Our main result is that in the expected revenue-maximizing mechanism, the seller makes available all the information that she can, and her expected revenue is the same as it would be if she could observe the part of the information that is “new” to the buyers. We also show that this mechanism can be implemented by what we call a handicap auction in interesting applications. In the first round of this auction, each buyer picks a price premium from a menu offered by the seller (a smaller premium costs more). Then the seller releases the additional signals. In the second round, the buyers bid in a second-price auction where the winner pays the sum of his premium and the second highest non-negative bid. In the case of a single buyer, this mechanism simplifies to a menu of European call options.

It approximately nests the two most common approaches: the time-varying parameter (TVP) model with a change-point every period and the change-point model with a small number of regimes. We focus considerable attention on the construction of reasonable hierarchical priors both for regime durations and for the parameters that characterize each regime. A Markov chain Monte Carlo posterior sampler is constructed to estimate a version of our model, which allows for change in conditional means and variances. We show how real-time forecasting can be done in an efficient manner using sequential importance sampling. Our techniques are found to work well in an empirical exercise involving U.S. GDP growth and inflation. Empirical results suggest that the number of change-points is larger than previously estimated in these series and the implied model is similar to a TVP (with stochastic volatility) model.

Yet trade theory has not considered the implications of institutional differences, beyond treating them simply as different technologies or taxes. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a simple model of international trade in which institutional differences are modelled within the framework of incomplete contracts. We show that doing so reverses many of the conclusions obtained by equating institutions with productivity. Institutional differences as a source of comparative advantage imply, among other things, that the less developed country may not gain from trade and factor prices may actually diverge as a result of trade. Second, we test empirically whether institutions act as a source of trade, using data on U.S. imports disaggregated by country and industry. The empirical results provide evidence of “institutional content of trade”: institutional differences are an important determinant of trade flows.

We find that such PTAs increase the cost of multilateral tariff reductions and thus cause a stumbling block to global free trade. This occurs because multilateral tariff reductions decrease the threat that can be used in PTAs and thus the surplus that can be extracted from them. By explicitly modelling the interaction between preferential and multilateral negotiations, we derive a testable prediction and provide novel econometric evidence that supports the model's key prediction. The welfare analysis shows that the current World Trade Organization rules allowing this type of PTAs may be optimal for economically large countries, thus the model can predict the rules we observe.

To that end, two models of household intertemporal behaviour are developed. In both models, household members are characterized by individual preferences. In the first formulation, household decisions are always on the ex ante Pareto frontier. In the second model, the assumption of intra-household commitment required by ex ante efficiency is relaxed. It is shown that the full-efficiency household Euler equations are nested in the no-commitment Euler equations. Using this result, the hypothesis that household members can commit to future allocations of resources is tested using the Consumer Expenditure Survey. I strongly reject this hypothesis. It is also shown that the standard unitary framework is a special case of the full-efficiency model. However, if household members are not able to commit, household intertemporal behaviour cannot be characterized using the standard life-cycle model. These findings have two main implications. First, policy makers can change household behaviour by modifying the decision power of individual household members. Second, to evaluate programmes designed to improve the welfare of household members, it would be beneficial to replace the standard unitary model with a characterization of household behaviour that allows for lack of commitment.

This contract can be implemented by cash reserves, debt, and equity. The latter is split between the financiers and the entrepreneur and pays dividends when retained earnings reach a threshold. To provide appropriate incentives to the entrepreneur, the firm is downsized when it runs short of cash. We then study the continuous-time limit of the model. We prove the convergence of the discrete-time value functions and optimal contracts. Our analysis yields rich implications for the dynamics of security prices.

This gap could arise because cities make workers more productive, or it could be the result of a non-random selection of workers into cities based on their ability and their endogenous history of career choices. To untangle these issues, this paper estimates a dynamic programming model, which embeds the choice of residing in a city or rural area within a model of career choices over time. After controlling for all the sources of selection and endogeneity, the estimates indicate that a given worker does earn more in the city for white-collar work, but not for blue-collar work. In addition, city work experience is found to be worth more than rural work experience in the rural area for white-collar work, but not for blue-collar work. These results support the interpretation that cities make white-collar workers more productive and suggest that workers may consider moving to the city not only in terms of locational choice, but also as a form of human capital investment.

We demonstrate that all sharing rules along the assortative order support efficient outcomes both in terms of premarital investments and intra-household allocations. The efficiency of premarital choices and household allocations then enables us to show that, for each couple, the marriage market generates a unique and maritally sustainable sharing rule that is a function of the distribution of premarital endowments and the sex ratios in the market. According to our results, transfers among spouses occur on two margins: premarital investments and intra-marital spousal allocations. Asymmetries in the sex ratios in the marriage markets produce gender differences in premarital investments and consumption that are larger for individuals with small premarital endowments than those with larger endowments. A corollary of these findings is that, when men are in short supply in the marriage markets, women can invest more than men even when the returns to investment are lower or the costs are higher for women.

One of the most important sources of match-specific capital is human capital acquired through match-specific learning. Such learning can take on two distinct forms. In the first case, workers accumulate match-specific human capital through learning by doing. In the second case, a worker and a firm in an employment relationship learn about the quality of the match over time, thereby acquiring valuable information. I construct a structural model that embeds these two learning explanations and show that it is possible to distinguish the two by using turnover data on employing firms coupled with data on workers. I use a French matched employer—employee data-set to estimate the structural model using the Efficient Method of Moments, a simulation-based estimation method. I find that, while learning by doing may be present during the first six months of an employment relationship, learning about match quality dominates at longer tenures. This finding has important consequences for the understanding of the sources of match-specific capital and for the desirability of policies that alter the incentives for turnover for workers of different tenure.

This creates a tension between local increasing returns, implied by the existence of cities, and aggregate constant returns, implied by balanced growth. To address this tension, we develop a general equilibrium theory of economic growth in an urban environment. In our theory, variation in the urban structure through the growth, birth, and death of cities is the margin that eliminates local increasing returns to yield constant returns to scale in the aggregate. We show that, consistent with the data, the theory produces a city size distribution that is well approximated by Zipf's law, but that also displays the observed systematic underrepresentation of both very small and very large cities. Using our model, we show that the dispersion of city sizes is consistent with the dispersion of productivity shocks found in the data.

Demand estimates are used to compute price-cost margins for retailers and manufacturers under different supply models when wholesale prices are not observed. The purpose is to identify the set of margins compatible with the margins obtained from estimates of cost and to select the model most consistent with the data among non-nested competing models. The models considered are (1) a simple linear pricing model; (2) a vertically integrated model; and (3) a variety of alternative (strategic) supply scenarios that allow for collusion, non-linear pricing, and strategic behaviour with respect to private label products. Using data on yogurt sold in several stores in a large urban area of the U.S. the results imply that wholesale prices are close to marginal cost and that retailers have pricing power in the vertical chain. This is consistent with non-linear pricing by the manufacturers or high bargaining power of the retailers.

When firms possess heterogeneous productivity, countries differ in relative factor abundance, and industries vary in factor intensity, falling trade costs induce reallocations of resources both within and across industries and countries. These reallocations generate substantial job turnover in all sectors, spur relatively more creative destruction in comparative advantage industries than in comparative disadvantage industries, and magnify ex ante comparative advantage to create additional welfare gains from trade. The improvements in aggregate productivity as countries liberalize dampen and can even reverse the real-wage losses of scarce factors.

In particular, though in the deterministic case the introduction or lowering of a price cap (above marginal cost) results in increased production, increased total welfare, decreased prices, and increased consumer welfare, we show that all of the above comparative statics predictions fail for generic uncertain demand functions. For example, for price caps sufficiently close to marginal cost, a decrease in the price cap always leads to a decrease in production and total welfare under certain mild conditions. Under stronger regularity assumptions, all of the monotone comparative statics predictions from the deterministic case also do not hold for a generic uncertain demand if we restrict attention to price caps in an arbitrary fixed interval (as long as the price caps are binding for some values in that interval).

In our benchmark model calibrated to the U.S. economy, privatization without compensation is favoured by 52% of the population. If social security participants are fully compensated for their contributions, and the transition to privatization is financed by a combination of debt and a consumption tax, 58% experience a welfare gain.

In the presence of such bias in factor demands, globalization caused by an improvement in the export technologies can lead to a worldwide increase in the relative prices of the factors used intensively in international trade. Furthermore, a worldwide increase in the factors used intensively in international trade can lead to globalization. To capture these effects, we develop a flexible approach to model costly international trade, which includes the standard iceberg approach as a special case. More specifically, we extend the Ricardian model of trade with a continuum of goods by introducing multiple factors of production and by making technologies of supplying goods depend on whether the destination is home or abroad. If the technologies of supplying the same good to the two destinations differ only in total factor productivity, the model becomes isomorphic to the Ricardian model with the iceberg cost. By allowing the two technologies to differ in the factor intensities, our approach enables us to examine the links between factor endowments, factor prices, and globalization that cannot be captured by the iceberg approach.

This paper provides a dynamic principal—agent framework suitable for analysing chief features of an optimal WTW program, such as the sequence and duration of the different policies, the dynamic pattern of payments along the unemployment spell, and the emergence of taxes/subsidies upon re-employment. The optimal program endogenously generates an absorbing policy of last resort (“social assistance”) characterized by a constant lifetime payment and no active participation by the agent. Human capital depreciation is a necessary condition for policy transitions to be part of an optimal WTW program. The typical sequence of policies is quite simple: the program starts with standard UI, then switches into monitored search and, finally, into SA. The optimal benefits are decreasing during unemployment insurance and constant during both JM and SA. Whereas taxes (subsidies) can be either increasing or decreasing with duration during UI, they must decrease (increase) during a phase of JM. In a calibration exercise, we use our model to analyse quantitatively the features of the optimal program for the U.S. economy. With respect to the existing U.S. system, the optimal WTW scheme delivers sizeable welfare gains to unskilled workers because the incentives to search for a job can be retained even while delivering more insurance and using costly monitoring less intensively.

To identify such an effect we exploit a policy change introduced in 1989 by the Austrian government, which affected various unemployed workers differently: a first group experienced an increase in RR; a second group experienced an extension of PBD; a third group experienced both a higher RR and a longer PBD; and a fourth group experienced no change in the policy parameters. We find that unemployed workers react to the disincentives by an increase in unemployment duration, and our empirical results are consistent with the predictions of job search theory. We use our parameter estimates to split up the total costs to unemployment insurance funds into costs due to changes in the unemployment insurance system with unchanged behaviour and costs due to behavioural responses of unemployed workers. Our results indicate that costs due to behavioural responses are substantial.

If patients chose rationally, the market would be inactive. I assume, however, that patients choose according to a boundedly rational procedure, which reflects ""anecdotal"" reasoning. This element of bounded rationality has significant implications. The market for quacks is active, and patients suffer a welfare loss which behaves non-monotonically w.r.t. n and α. In an extended model that endogenizes the quacks' choice of ""treatments"", the quacks minimize the force of price competition by offering maximally differentiated treatments. The patients' welfare loss is robust to market interventions, which would crowd out low-quality firms in standard models. Thus, as long as the patients' quality of reasoning is not lifted above the anecdotal level, ordinary competition policies may be ineffective.

The menu does not exclude any type: it provides a perfect commitment device for relatively sophisticated types, and “exploitative” contracts which involve speculation with relatively naive types.

Our results indicate that an auction of entry licences has a significant positive effect on average prices in oligopoly but not in monopoly. These results are consistent with the conjecture that entry fees induce players to take more risk in pursuit of higher expected profits. In oligopoly, entry fees increase the probability that the market entrants coordinate on a collusive price path. In monopoly, taking more risk does not make sense since average prices are already close to the profit-maximizing price.

Because information production has high fixed costs, competitive producers charge more for low-demand information than for high-demand information. The low price of high-demand information makes investors want to purchase the same information that others are purchasing. When investors price assets using a common subset of information, news about one asset affects the other assets' prices; asset prices comove.

Our objective is to investigate the effect of fixed costs and, in particular, market size on entry and exit rates and hence on the age distribution of firms.We analyse a stochastic dynamic model of a monopolistically competitive industry. Each firm's efficiency is assumed to follow a Markov process. We show existence and uniqueness of a stationary equilibrium with simultaneous entry and exit: efficient firms survive, while inefficient ones leave the market and are replaced by new entrants. We perform comparative dynamics with respect to the level of fixed costs: entry costs are negatively related and fixed production costs positively related to entry and exit rates. A central empirical prediction of the model is that the level of firm turnover is increasing in market size. In larger markets, competition is endogenously more intense than in smaller markets, and so price-cost margins are smaller. This price competition effect implies that the marginal surviving firm has to be more efficient than in smaller markets. Hence, in larger markets, the expected lifespan of firms is shorter, and the age distribution of firms is first-order stochastically dominated by that in smaller markets.In the empirical part, the prediction on market size and firm turnover is tested on an industry where firms compete in well-defined geographical markets of different sizes. Using data on hair salons in Sweden, we show that an increase in market size or fixed costs shifts the age distribution of firms towards younger firms, as predicted by the model.

First, the optimal plan is shown to respond to a country's temptation to leave the union by tilting both current and future policy in its favour. This yields a non-linear rule according to which each country weight in policy decisions is time-varying and depends on its incentive to abandon the union. Second, we show that there might be conditions such that a break-up of the union, as has occurred in some historical episodes, is efficient.

We assume that there is a status quo bias: if there is a fight today, yesterday's winner is in a stronger position than the other group. Hence, a change of the status quo has long-term consequences that groups need to take into account. Important applications of this model include lobbying for legislation and political transitions through revolutions. We analyse the strategic timing of attacks on the status quo, which is similar to investment decisions under uncertainty. We find that the attack threshold is considerably lower than in a comparable one-period game, and that the expenditure level necessary to change the status quo is low in comparison to the prize; this provides a possible solution to Tullock's “rent-seeking paradox” in lobbying.

The combination of risk neutrality with incomplete contracts that restrict the ability of an agent to report on interim states is a force for long-term assignments. More generally, however, rotating agents can be valuable because it conceals information from agents, which mitigates incentive constraints. With complete contracts that communicate interim states, rotation allows for even more concealment possibilities and better-targeted incentives. Furthermore, it allows for the reporting of interim shocks at no cost to the principal. Properties of the production technology are also shown to matter. Substitutability of intertemporal effort is a force for long-term assignments, while coordination with Nash equilibrium strategies is a force for job rotation.

Optimal allocations in these environments are complicated and history-dependent. Yet, we show that they can be implemented as competitive equilibria in market economies supplemented with simple tax systems. The market structure in these economies is similar to that in Bewley (1986) ; agents supply labour and trade risk-free claims to future consumption, subject to a budget constraint and a debt limit. Optimal taxes are conditioned only on two observable characteristics—an agent's accumulated stock of claims, or wealth, and her current labour income. We show that optimal taxes are generally non-linear and non-separable in these variables and relate the structure of marginal wealth and income taxation to the properties of agent preferences.

Namely, the lower the greatest average tax rate over the range of low incomes, the better. We show that, as a consequence, the optimal tax should give the greatest subsidies to the working poor (the agents having the lowest skill and choosing the largest labour time).

Much of this divergence is due to different trends in within-group inequality, which has increased significantly for income, but little for consumption. We then develop a simple framework that allows us to characterize analytically how within-group income inequality affects consumption inequality in a world in which agents can trade a full set of contingent consumption claims, subject to endogenous constraints emanating from the limited enforcement of intertemporal contracts. Finally, we quantitatively evaluate, in the context of a calibrated general equilibrium production economy, whether this set-up, or alternatively a standard incomplete markets model, can account for the documented stylized consumption inequality facts from the U.S. data.

This feature is typically assumed ad hoc in customer-market and brand-switching-cost models. A central result of the paper is that deep habits give rise to countercyclical mark-ups, which is in line with the empirical evidence. This result is important, because ad hoc formulations of customer-market and switching-cost models have been criticized for implying procyclical and hence counterfactual mark-up movements.

We obtain an information aggregation result similar to that of Wilson (1977) , while dispensing with almost all symmetric assumptions and using a milder solution concept than the Nash equilibrium. In particular, if every bidder is ex ante identical, then any rationalizable bidding strategy must be within a small neighbourhood of the symmetric Nash equilibrium.

By designing the security optimally, issuers can avoid exclusion altogether. We show that the optimal security is debt. Because of its low informational sensitivity, debt mitigates the adverse selection problem.

To investigate the macroeconomic dimensions of gross credit flows, the paper studies the cyclical behaviour of aggregate credit flows and documents three key cyclical facts. First, excess credit reallocation is countercyclical: for any given rate of change of net credit, gross flows are larger in a recession than in a boom. Second, gross credit flows are highly volatile, with a cyclical volatility which appears more than an order of magnitude larger than GDP volatility. Third, credit contraction is more volatile than credit expansion. Furthermore, the behaviour of gross flows over the 1991 recession suggests that persistent and historically high credit contraction is a key feature of the relatively mild cyclical downturn. The results lend some support to aggregate models that emphasize the asymmetric behaviour of credit expansion and credit contractions.

For example, in the U.S. the government delegates aspects of financial market regulation to self-regulatory organizations (SROs) like the New York Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers. We analyse one regulatory task of an SRO, enforcing antifraud rules so agents will not cheat customers. Specifically, we model contracting/enforcement as a two-tier problem. An SRO chooses its enforcement policy: the likelihood that an agent is investigated for fraud and a penalty schedule. Given an enforcement policy, agents compete by offering contracts that maximize customers' expected utility. We assume that the SRO's objective is to maximize the welfare of its members, the agents.

A general conclusion is that control of the enforcement policy governing contracts confers substantial market power to a group of otherwise competitive agents.

We show that a key difference among these regimes lies in the relative amount of exchange rate volatility that they entail. We also discuss a special case for which domestic inflation targeting constitutes the optimal policy, and where a simple second order approximation to the utility of the representative consumer can be derived and used to evaluate the welfare losses associated with the suboptimal rules.

We estimate the model using extensive data for a representative sample of 1300 California households. The results imply a strikingly skewed distribution of household electricity price elasticities in the population, with a small fraction of households accounting for most aggregate demand response.

A social planner would like to ensure efficient behaviour among a group of agents whose actions are sources of externalities. However, the planner has limited information about the agents' preferences, and is unable to distinguish individual agents except through their action choices. We prove that if a concavity condition on aggregate payoffs is satisfied, the planner can guarantee that efficient behaviour is globally stable under a wide range of behaviour adjustment processes by administering a variable pricing scheme. Through a series of applications, we show that the concavity condition is naturally satisfied in settings involving negative externalities. We conclude by contrasting the performance of the pricing mechanism with that of a mechanism based on direct revelation and announcement dependent forcing contracts.

One view holds that liquidations are beneficial in that they result in increased restructuring. Another view holds that this rise in restructuring is costly since liquidations are privately inefficient and essentially wasteful. This paper proposes an alternative perspective. On the basis of a combination of theory with empirical evidence on gross job flows and on financial and labour market rents, we find that, cumulatively, recessions result in reduced rather than increased restructuring, and that this is likely to be socially costly once we consider inefficiencies on both the creation and destruction margins.

We allow for arbitrary correlation between the true variables and the measurement errors. To solve the identification problem, we require the existence of an auxiliary data-set that contains information about the conditional distribution of the true variables given the mismeasured variables. Our main assumption requires that the conditional distribution of the true variables given the mismeasured variables is the same in the primary and auxiliary data. Our methods allow the auxiliary data to be a validation sample, where the primary and validation data are from the same distribution, and more importantly, a stratified sample where the auxiliary data-set is not from the same distribution as the primary data. We also show how to combine the two data-sets to obtain a more efficient estimator of the parameter of interest. We establish the large sample properties of the sieve based estimators under verifiable conditions. In particular, we allow for the mismeasured variables to have unbounded supports without employing the tedious trimming scheme typically used in kernel based methods. We illustrate our methods by estimating a returns to schooling censored quantile regression using the CPS/SSR 1978 exact match files where the dependent variable is measured with error of arbitrary kind.

Controlling for the personal characteristics of the respondents, year and country fixed effects and country-specific time trends, we find that the data describe social happiness functions for left-wing and right-wing individuals where inflation and unemployment enter negatively. We use these functions to test the root assumption of partisan business cycle models. The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that left-wing individuals care more about unemployment relative to inflation than right-wingers. Interestingly, we find that individuals declare themselves to be happier when the party they support is in power, even after controlling for macroeconomic variables. The effect of politics is large. Finally, we find that these partisan differences cannot be traced back to income differences. That is, it is misleading to assume—as it is done in the previous literature—that the poor (rich) behave similarly to the left (right). For example, inflation and unemployment do not have differential effects across rich and poor and the happiness levels of these two groups are unaffected by the identity of the party in power. Our findings are hard to explain using median voter models but are to be expected in a partisan world.

The method of simulated moments is used to match the life cycle profiles of labour force participation, hours worked, and assets that are estimated from the data to those that are generated by the model. The model establishes that the tax structure of the Social Security system and pensions are key determinants of the high observed job exit rates at ages 62 and 65. Removing the tax wedge embedded in the Social Security earnings test for individuals aged 65 and older would delay job exit by almost one year. By contrast, Social Security benefit levels, health, and borrowing constraints are less important determinants of job exit at older ages.

We propose a new class of specification tests for time series conditional mean models, where the dimension of the conditioning information set may be infinite. Both linear and nonlinear conditional mean specifications are covered. The tests can detect a wide range of model misspecifications in mean while being robust to conditional heteroscedasticity and higher order time-varying moments of unknown form. They check a large number of lags, but naturally discount higher order lags, which is consistent with the stylized fact that economic behaviours are more affected by the recent past events than by the remote past events. No specific estimation method is required, and the tests have the appealing ""nuisance parameter free"" property that parameter estimation uncertainty has no impact on the limit distribution of the tests. A simulation study shows that it is important to take into account the impact of conditional heteroscedasticity; failure to do so will cause overrejection of a correct conditional mean model. In a horse race competition on testing linearity in mean, our tests have omnibus and robust power against a variety of alternatives relative to some existing tests. In an application, we find that after removing significant but possibly spurious autocorrelations due to nonsynchronous trading, there still exists significant predictable nonlinearity in mean for S&P 500 and NASDAQ daily returns.

However, it is well known that the DID estimator is based on strong identifying assumptions. In particular, the conventional DID estimator requires that, in the absence of the treatment, the average outcomes for the treated and control groups would have followed parallel paths over time. This assumption may be implausible if pre-treatment characteristics that are thought to be associated with the dynamics of the outcome variable are unbalanced between the treated and the untreated. That would be the case, for example, if selection for treatment is influenced by individual-transitory shocks on past outcomes (Ashenfelter's dip). This article considers the case in which differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between treated and controls. It is shown that, in such a case, a simple two-step strategy can be used to estimate the average effect of the treatment for the treated. In addition, the estimation framework proposed in this article allows the use of covariates to describe how the average effect of the treatment varies with changes in observed characteristics.

To estimate the average returns to experience, sector tenure and firm specific tenure within this context, we develop an identification strategy which relies on the use of firm closures. Our data source is a new and unique administrative data-set for Germany that includes complete work histories as well as individual characteristics. We find positive returns to experience and firm tenure for skilled workers. The returns to experience for unskilled workers are small and insignificant after 2 years of experience. Their returns to sector tenure are also zero. However, their returns to firm tenure are substantial.

The result does not derive from the stability of the deterministic steady state and is not affected essentially by price stickiness.

When the fraction of high-quality producers in the economy is given, money promotes the production of high-quality goods, which improves the quality mix and welfare unambiguously. When this fraction is endogenous, however, we find that money can decrease welfare relative to the barter equilibrium. The origin of this inefficiency is that money provides consumption insurance to low-quality producers, which can result in a higher fraction of low-quality producers in the monetary equilibrium. Finally, we find that most often agents acquire more costly information in the monetary equilibrium than in the barter equilibrium. Consequently, money is welfare-enhancing because it promotes useful production and exchange, but not because it saves information costs.

The main finding is that the mere presence of such history-dependent outside options forces equilibrium concessions in the negotiation phase to be gradual, and the degree of gradualism is characterized.

For instance, when consumers search with low intensity, an increase in the number of firms reduces search, does not affect expected price, leads to greater price dispersion and reduces welfare. In contrast, when consumers search with high intensity, increased competition results in more search and lower prices when the number of competitors in the market is low to begin with, but in less search and higher prices when the number of competitors is large.

First, it must prevent borrowers from defaulting on one bank and transferring their resources to another bank. Second, and less obviously, it must give banks the incentive to make sizeable loans, and to honour their promises of future credit. We establish that the optimal regulation resembles observed laws governing default on debt. Moreover, if debtors have the right to a ""fresh start"" after bankruptcy then this must be balanced by enforceable provisions against fraudulent conveyance. Our optimal regulation is robust, in that it can be implemented in a way that does not require the regulator to have information about either the borrower or lender. Our results isolate the way in which specific institutions surrounding bankruptcy—namely rules governing asset garnishment and fraudulent conveyances—support loan markets in which borrowers have no collateral.

Tubewell owners and their tenants also use considerably more groundwater on their plots than other farmers. Using detailed price and quantity data, the efficiency and distributional implications of this monopoly power are explored.

It is based on sectoral differences in corporate finance: the nontradables sector is special in that it faces a contract enforceability problem and enjoys bailout guarantees. As a result, currency mismatch and borrowing constraints arise endogenously in that sector. This sectoral asymmetry allows the model to replicate the main features of observed boom-bust episodes. In particular, episodes begin with a lending boom and a real appreciation, peak in a self-fulfilling crisis during which a real depreciation coincides with widespread bankruptcies, and end in a recession and credit crunch.

Borrowing constraints arise because borrowers face limited liability and debt repayment cannot be perfectly enforced. In the model, the dynamics of debt are closely linked with the dynamics of borrowing constraints. In fact, borrowing constraints must satisfy a dynamic consistency requirement: the value of outstanding debt restricts current access to short-term capital, but is itself determined by future access to credit. This dynamic consistency is not guaranteed in models of exogenous borrowing constraints, where the ability to raise short-term capital is limited by some prespecified function of debt. We characterize the optimal default-free contract—which minimizes borrowing constraints at all histories—and derive implications for firm growth, survival, leverage and debt maturity. The model is qualitatively consistent with stylized facts on the growth and survival of firms. Comparative statics with respect to technology and default constraints are derived.

We focus on symmetric perfect public equilibria, wherein any ""punishments"" are borne equally by all firms. We identify a tradeoff that is associated with collusive pricing schemes in which the price to be charged by each firm is strictly increasing in its cost level: such ""fully sorting"" schemes offer efficiency benefits, as they ensure that the lowest-cost firm makes the current sale, but they also imply an informational cost (distorted pricing and/or equilibrium-path price wars), since a higher-cost firm must be deterred from mimicking a lower-cost firm by charging a lower price. A rigid-pricing scheme, where a firm's collusive price is independent of its current cost position, sacrifices efficiency benefits but also diminishes the informational cost. For a wide range of settings, the optimal symmetric collusive scheme requires (i) the absence of equilibrium-path price wars and (ii) a rigid price. If firms are sufficiently impatient, however, the rigid-pricing scheme cannot be enforced, and the collusive price of lower-cost firms may be distorted downward in order to diminish the incentive to cheat. When the model is modified to include i.i.d. public demand shocks, the downward pricing distortion that accompanies a firm's lower-cost realization may occur only when current demand is high.

If shocks across countries are sufficiently correlated, then, according to this argument, delegating monetary policy to a single central bank is not very costly and a monetary union is desirable.This paper explores this argument in a setting with both monetary and fiscal policies. In an economy with monetary policy alone, we confirm the presence of the trade-off and find that indeed a monetary union will not be welfare improving if the correlation of national shocks is too low. However, fiscal interventions by national governments, combined with a central bank that has the ability to commit to monetary policy, overturn these results. In equilibrium, such a monetary union will be welfare improving for any correlation of shocks.

Although there may be a multitude of reasons why delegation arises in reality, one intriguing possibility is that it yields a strategic advantage to the delegating party. In the case where only one party has the option to delegate, we analyse the possibility that strategic delegation arises as an equilibrium outcome under completely unobservable incentive contracts within the class of two-person extensive form games. We show that delegation may arise solely due to strategic reasons in quite general economic environments even under unobservable contracts. Furthermore, under some reasonable restrictions on out-of-equilibrium beliefs and actions of the outside party, strategic delegation is shown to be the only equilibrium outcome.

In the equilibrium of this game, only the first player buys a signal and makes a decision based on this information whereas all following players do not buy a signal and herd behind the first player. The experimental results show that too many signals are bought and the equilibrium prediction performs poorly. To explain these observations, the depth of the subjects' reasoning process is estimated, using a statistical error-rate model.

Decision makers face the selection problem as they seek to learn from observation of past actions and outcomes, while not observing the counterfactual outcomes that would have occurred had other actions been chosen. Assuming that all cohorts face the same outcome distributions, I show that social learning is a process of sequential reduction in ambiguity.

Sustaining a tight relationship with a monitor (bank, venture capitalist) allows them to finance their operations without going public until profitability prospects are clearer or incentive problems are less severe. However, the earlier young firms go public, the quicker monitors' informed capital is redirected towards new start-ups. Hence, when informed capital is in limited supply, factors that lower the costs for start-ups to go public encourage business creation. Technological spill-overs associated with business creation and thick market externalities in the young firms segment of the stock market provide prima facie cases for encouraging young firms to go public.

Application of this central result to tests of asset pricing models requires a deliberate selection bias.

Theory suggests that cross-elasticities between stores of the same firm enhance market power. To evaluate the importance of this effect in the U.K. supermarket industry, we estimate a model of consumer choice and expenditure using three data sources: profit margins for each chain, a survey of consumer choices and a data-set of store characteristics. To permit plausible substitution patterns, the utility model interacts consumer and store characteristics. We measure market power by calculating the effect of merger and demerger on Nash equilibrium prices. Demerger reduces the prices of the largest firms by between 2 and 3.8% depending on local concentration; mergers between the largest firms lead to price increases up to 7.4%.

This paper models the incentives of the media to deliver news to different groups. The increasing-returns-to-scale technology and advertising financing of media firms induce them to provide more news to large groups, such as taxpayers and dispersed consumer interests, and groups that are valuable to advertisers. This news bias alters the trade-off in political competition and therefore introduces a bias in public policy. The paper also discusses the effects of broadcast media replacing newspapers as the main information source about politics.

In a standard model, absence of commitment leads to multiple equilibria, or expectation traps, even without trigger strategies. In these traps, expectations of high or low inflation lead the public to take defensive actions, which then make accommodating those expectations the optimal monetary policy. Under commitment, the equilibrium is unique and the inflation rate is low on average. This analysis suggests that institutions which promote commitment can prevent high inflation episodes from recurring.

We examine the optimal monetary policy under commitment, focusing on the nature of price adjustment in determining policy. We investigate the implications of these policies for exchange-rate flexibility. The traditional approach maintains that exchange-rate flexibility is desirable in the presence of real country-specific shocks that require adjustment in relative prices. However, in the light of empirical evidence on nominal price response to exchange-rate changes—specifically, that there appears to be a large degree of local-currency pricing (LCP) in industrialized countries—the expenditure-switching role played by nominal exchange rates may be exaggerated in the traditional literature. In the presence of LCP, we find that the optimal monetary policy leads to a fixed exchange rate, even in the presence of country-specific shocks.

Constructing a model with two sets of frictions—costly price adjustment by imperfectly competitive firms and costly exchange of wealth for goods—we find optimal monetary policy is governed by two familiar principles. First, the average level of the nominal interest rate should be sufficiently low, as suggested by Milton Friedman, that there should be deflation on average. Yet, the Keynesian frictions imply that the optimal nominal interest rate is positive. Second, as various shocks occur to the real and monetary sectors, the price level should be largely stabilized, as suggested by Irving Fisher, albeit around a deflationary trend path. Since expected inflation is roughly constant through time, the nominal interest rate must therefore vary with the Fisherian determinants of the real interest rate. Although the monetary authority has substantial leverage over real activity in our model economy, it chooses real allocations that closely resemble those which would occur if prices were flexible. In our benchmark model, there is some tendency for the monetary authority to smooth nominal and real interest rates.

Observability of current variables is essential for informational consistency of the learning setup with the model setup but generates multiple temporary equilibria when prices are flexible and prevents a straightforward construction of the learning dynamics. Sticky prices overcome this problem by avoiding simultaneity between prices and price expectations. Adaptive learning then robustly selects the determinate (monetary) steady state independent from the degree of imperfect competition. The indeterminate (non-monetary) steady state and non-stationary equilibria are never stable. Stability in a deterministic version of the model may differ because perfect foresight equilibria can be the limit of restricted perceptions equilibria of the stochastic economy with vanishing noise and thereby inherit different stability properties. This discontinuity at the zero variance of shocks suggests one should analyse learning in stochastic models.

We measure this strength by the expected weight that individuals attach to the utility of future generations. On the one hand, if the bequest motive is strong, then an increase in the social security tax raises the bequests left by altruistic parents. On the other hand, when the importance of altruism in motivating savings is sufficiently low, the increase in the social security tax could result in a reduction of the bequests left by altruistic parents under some conditions on the attitude of individuals toward risk and on the relative returns associated with private saving and social security.

Skill premia are determined by technology, the relative supply of skills, and trade. Technology is itself endogenous, and responds to profit incentives. An increase in the relative supply of skills, holding technology constant, reduces the skill premium. But an increase in the supply of skills over time also induces a change in technology, increasing the demand for skills. The most important result of the paper is that increased international trade induces skill-biased technical change. As a result, trade opening can cause a rise in inequality both in the U.S. and the less developed countries, and thanks to the induced skill-biased technical change, this can happen without a rise in the relative prices of skill-intensive goods in the U.S., which is the usual intervening mechanism in the standard trade models.

Collusion between players i and j is a contract merging their resources in the hands of one of them, say i.

In a model where a venture capitalist provides staged financing for a project, we illustrate an advantage of convertible debt (or warrants) over a mixture of debt and equity. Essentially, when the venture capitalist retains the option to abandon the project, the entrepreneur has an incentive to engage in window dressing and bias positively the short-term performance of the project, reducing the probability that it will be liquidated. An appropriately designed convertible security prevents such behaviour because window dressing also increases the probability that the venture capitalist will exercise the conversion option becoming the owner of a substantial fraction of the project's equity.

With incompleteness in contracting, viable production relationships between firms and workers, and therefore the profitability of industries, depend on the rates of innovation and growth. The speed at which new innovations arrive in turn depends on the profitability of production, for the usual reasons examined in the endogenous growth literature. We show that these interactions can have important implications which are consistent with observed phenomena in both the micro and macro environments. In particular, we demonstrate that a technological shock (increasing productivity of research) can, through this interaction, lead to a productivity slowdown and a shift in labour market contracts away from firms providing implicit guarantees of lifetime employment and towards shorter-term “contractor” type arrangements. We show the consistency of an increase in the proportion of the labour force under short-term employment, increased relative returns of workers in high-productivity sectors, and increased income inequality, with a productivity slowdown of finite duration.

We therefore consider self-enforcing risk-sharing agreements that are robust not only to single-person deviations but also to potential deviations by subgroups. However, such deviations must be credible, in the sense that the subgroup must pass exactly the same test that we apply to the entire group; it must itself employ some self-enforcing risk-sharing agreement. We observe that the stability of subgroups is inimical to the stability of the group as a whole. Two surprising consequences of this analysis are that stable groups have (uniformly) bounded size, a result in sharp contrast to the individual-deviation problem, and that the degree of risk-sharing in a community is generally non-monotonic in the level of uncertainty or need for insurance in the community.

I compare the production processes by estimating a model that allows for heterogeneity in technology and productivity, both of which are intrinsically unobservable.

Hicks-neutral productivity growth is estimated to be lower, while capital-biased (labour-saving) productivity growth is higher for the new technology. Using the estimation results, I decompose industry-wide productivity growth and find plant-level changes in lean plants to be the most important contributor.

The fundamental equilibrium path is derived and the time-series properties of aggregate GDP are studied analytically. Although firms' productivities are subject to temporary shocks, the aggregate process displays a surprising novel form of nonlinearity and long memory which had not been built into the model at the outset. This aggregate GDP turns out to have very different properties from log-linear time-series models such as auto-regressive (AR) models and their extensions. It displays very strong persistence, which ends abruptly with a sudden change of tendency, giving its autocorrelation function (ACF) an S-shape. Although persistent, it is mean-reverting, unlike the everlasting memory of unit-root processes. Its volatility is of a greater order of magnitude than that of any of its components, so small micro-shocks can generate large macro fluctuations. It is also characterized by long, asymmetric cycles of random lengths. Increased monopoly power tends to reduce the amplitude and increase the persistence of business cycles. Strikingly, we find that the empirical ACFs constructed from GDP data for the U.K. and the U.S. display this characteristic S-shape.

This paper develops a simple framework to analyse the forces that shape these biases. There are two major forces affecting equilibrium bias: the price effect and the market size effect. While the former encourages innovations directed at scarce factors, the latter leads to technical change favouring abundant factors. The elasticity of substitution between different factors regulates how powerful these effects are, determining how technical change and factor prices respond to changes in relative supplies. If the elasticity of substitution is sufficiently large, the long run relative demand for a factor can slope up.I apply this framework to develop possible explanations to the following questions: why technical change over the past 60 years was skill biased, and why the skill bias may have accelerated over the past 25 years? Why new technologies introduced during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries were unskill biased? What is the effect of biased technical change on the income gap between rich and poor countries? Does international trade affect the skill bias of technical change? What are the implications of wage push for technical change? Why is technical change generally labour augmenting rather than capital augmenting?

The social benefits in each country are financed by a source based tax on capital which is democratically chosen by its inhabitants. If either capital or labour is internationally mobile, the countries engage in fiscal competition and the partial integration of capital or labour markets is detrimental to the countries' redistributive ability. A move from partial to full integration, however, may alleviate rather than intensify fiscal competition, particularly, if the two countries face sufficiently similar economic and political conditions. In such a situation, for example, tax competition for mobile capital is softened as the labour market becomes more integrated and even vanishes if both factors are fully mobile. As a result, there is more redistribution in equilibrium and a majority of the population in each country is strictly better off.

Agents' uncertainty is resolved through individual and privately known shocks to their types. In such a situation the principal may screen agents according to their ex ante or ex post type, by offering either a menu of optional tariffs or a standard nonlinear schedule. The theoretical implications of the model are used to evaluate a tariff experiment run by South Central Bell in two cities in Kentucky in 1986. The empirical approach explicitly accounts for the existence of informational asymmetries between local telephone users and the monopolist, leading to different, nested, econometric specifications under symmetric and asymmetric information. The empirical evidence suggests that there exists a significant asymmetry of information between consumers and the monopolist under both tariff regimes.

The planner and the non-faulty players only know that there can be at most k faulty players in the population. However, they know neither the identity of the faulty players, their exact number nor how faulty players behave. We define a solution concept which requires a player to optimally respond to the non-faulty players regardless of the identity and actions of the faulty players. We introduce a notion of fault tolerant implementation, which unlike standard notions of full implementation, also requires robustness to deviations from the equilibrium. The main result of this paper establishes that under symmetric information any choice rule that satisfies two properties—k-monotonicity and no veto power—can be implemented by a strategic game form if there are at least three players and the number of faulty players is less than 1\2n−1. As an application of our result we present examples of simple mechanisms that implement the constrained Walrasian function and a choice rule for the efficient allocation of an indivisible good.

We say that s is justifiable if against the ex post criticism that some other strategy s′ outperforms s against b, the player can argue that playing s′ would have exposed him to similar criticism in the opposite direction.

However, it is unclear from Johnson's analysis and from subsequent research on the subject how this power is determined in general economic environments. An important goal of this paper is to address this issue. With the help of a neoclassical trade model in which country size is at centre stage, it is shown that a sufficient condition for a country to prefer a non-cooperative Nash tariff equilibrium (retaliation) over free trade is that its relative size be sufficiently large. The paper also refines the structure of the general trade model and generates additional characterization results on the importance of country size for best-response tariff functions, retaliatory tariffs, and welfare.

Uncertainty takes two distinct forms: the technological success of the project is probabilistic, while the economic value of the patent to be won evolves stochastically over time. According to the theory of real options uncertainty generates an option value of delay, but with two competing firms the fear of preemption would appear to undermine this approach. In non-cooperative equilibrium two patterns of investment emerge depending on parameter values. In a pre-emptive leaderfollower equilibrium firms invest sequentially and option values are reduced by competition. A symmetric outcome may also occur, however, in which investment is more delayed than the single-firm counterpart. Comparing this with the optimal cooperative investment pattern, investment is found to be more delayed when firms act non-cooperatively as each holds back from investing in the fear of starting a patent race. Implications of the analysis for empirical and policy issues in R&D are considered.

The optimal education policy we derive is elitist: it increases the spread between the educational achievement of the bright and the less bright individuals, compared to private provision. It is also such that the education received by less bright individuals depends positively on their parental income. Finally, the optimal education policy is input regressive, in the sense of Arrow (1971, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 38, 175–208): households with higher income and brighter children contribute less in tuition fees towards the cost of the education system than households with lower income and less bright children.

We ride on two major ideas. First, we show that operating leverage, originating in the priority status of wage claims given the observed business cycle characteristics of the latter, magnifies the risk properties of the residual payments to firm owners and justifies a substantial risk premium. Further we build on the observation that the low frequency variations in income shares constitute a significant source of risk, one that is unlikely to be insurable. When we price this risk in an incomplete market framework, we obtain a GE model with return volatilities close to observations and a sizable equity premium. This is accomplished in a world of low risk aversion and standard utility function but with agent heterogeneity. Workers with restricted access to financial markets are insured by firms and the consumption and preferences of firm owners solely determine the pricing kernel.

Unlike parametric alternatives, it does not require the specification of a distribution of varying tastes. The extended logit model can give a quick indication of the impact of taste variation on estimates and it generates estimates of the covariances of the taste shifters. It can be used as an exploratory device en route to the construction of a model incorporating a particular form of random taste variation and it can be used to determine whether such effort is required at all. When the amount of taste variation is not excessive the approximate model can be adequate itself. The model nests the conventional logit model which leads to a misspecification diagnostic.

Chile presents an interesting setting to study this relationship since it underwent a massive trade liberalization that significantly exposed its plants to competition from abroad during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Methodologically, I approach this question in two steps. In the first step, I estimate a production function to obtain a measure of plant productivity. I estimate the production function semiparametrically to correct for the presence of selection and simultaneity biases in the estimates of the input coefficients required to construct a productivity measure. I explicitly incorporate plant exit in the estimation to correct for the selection problem induced by liquidated plants. These methodological aspects are important in obtaining a reliable plant-level productivity measure based on consistent estimates of the input coefficients. In the second step, I identify the impact of trade on plants' productivity in a regression framework allowing variation in productivity over time and across traded- and nontraded-goods sectors. Using plant-level panel data on Chilean manufacturers, I find evidence of within plant productivity improvements that can be attributed to a liberalized trade for the plants in the import-competing sector. In many cases, aggregate productivity improvements stem from the reshuffling of resources and output from less to more efficient producers.

We develop a multidimensional methodology for addressing this class of problems, providing two important applications to nonlinear pricing. First, with nonlinear pricing by a monopolist the familiar “nodistortion-at-the-top” result persists, but in tandem with the surprising conclusion that there is either no distortion at the bottom or bunching. Second, in a simple model of product differentiated duopolists competing with nonlinear pricing we show that, generally, the duopoly outcome is qualitatively similar to the monopoly outcome. However, when marginal costs are symmetric and competition is sufficiently intense, distortions disappear and the equilibrium outcome takes a remarkably simple form: efficient quality allocations with cost-plus-fee pricing.

The size of the surplus being divided is specified as a two-state Markov chain with transitions that are synchronized with contract negotiation dates. Equilibrium involves information cycles triggered by the success or failure of aggressive demands made by the seller. Because there is persistence in the Markov chain generating the surplus, a successful demand induces the seller to make another aggressive demand in the next negotiation, since the buyer's acceptance reveals that the current surplus is large. Rejection of an aggressive demand, on the other hand, leads the seller to be pessimistic about the size of the surplus in the next contract, so the seller makes a ""soft"" offer that is sure to be accepted. Then, after several such offers have been accepted, the seller is optimistic enough to again make an aggressive demand, creating an information cycle. An interesting feature of this cycle is that the soft price is not constant, but declines as the cycle continues, so as to offset the buyer's option value of re-starting the cycle when the current state is bad. An explicit mapping is given for the relationship between the basic parameters and the equilibrium prices and quantities; in particular, there is a closed-form solution for the threshold belief that makes the seller indifferent between hard and soft offers.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a68_3ay_3a2001_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a719-755..htm,10.1111/1467-937X.00188

We decompose the time series innovation of the income process into its common and cohort-specific components. From these we compute conditional variances which are used as separate risk terms in a consumption growth equation. Using a long series of British household data we exploit the time-series variation to identify precautionary saving effects and find strong evidence of their importance. Specifically, after allowing for demographic and labour market status, there is an independent role for income risk in explaining consumption growth. Rather than the component that is common across cohorts, however, it is the cohort-specific element that is important in determining changes in consumption growth.

The purpose of this paper is to document and explain this price dispersion. Using a panel data set extending from 1980 to 1993, we first demonstrate two main facts concerning car prices in Europe: (1) The existence of significant differences in quality adjusted prices across countries, with Italy and the U.K. systematically representing the most expensive markets. (2) Substantial year-to-year volatility that is to a large extent accounted for by exchange rate fluctuations and the incomplete response of local currency prices to these fluctuations. These facts are analysed within the framework of a multiproduct oligopoly model with product differentiation. The model identifies three potential sources for the international price differences: price elasticities generating differences in markups, costs, and import quota constraints. Local currency price stability can be attributed either to the presence of a local component in marginal costs, or to markup adjustment that is correlated with exchange rate volatility; the latter requires that the perceived elasticity of demand is increasing in price. We find that the primary reason for the higher prices in Italy is the existence of a strong bias for domestic brancs that generates high markups for the domestic firm (Fiat). In the U.K. higher prices are mainly attributed to better equipped cars and/or differences in the dealer discount practices. The import quota constraints are found to have a significant impact on Japanese car prices in Italy, France and the U.K. With respect to local currency price stability, a large percentage of the documented price inertia can be attributed to local costs, and a smaller fraction to markup adjustment that is indicative of price discrimination. Based on these results we conjecture that the EMU will substantially reduce the year-to-year volatility observed in the car price data, but without further measures to increase European integration, it will not completely eliminate existing cross-country price differences.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a68_3ay_3a2001_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a811-848..htm,10.1111/1467-937X.00191

If the informed party's reservation value does not depend on its private information (its type), it is a standard result that the uninformed side offers ""low"" types distorted contracts to reduce the information rent left to ""high"" types. We challenge this result by embedding contract design in a matching market environment. We consider a market where players meet pairwise and where, in each match, either side may be chosen to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer.

However, standard theory argues that diversification would reduce the inconvenience of idiosyncratic risk to arbitrarily low levels. This paper shows that this argument is not robust: ambiguity aversion can exacerbate the tension between the two kinds of risks to the point that classes of agents may not want to trade some financial assets. Thus, theoretically, the effect of ambiguity aversion on financial markets is to make the risk sharing opportunities offered by financial markets less complete than it would be otherwise.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a68_3ay_3a2001_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a883-904..htm,10.1111/1467-937X.00194

In contrast to earlier Schumpeterian models in which innovations are always made by outsider firms who earn no rents if they fail to innovate and become monopolies if they do innovate, here we find: first, that the usual Schumpeterian effect of more intense product market competition (PMC) is almost always outweighed by the increased incentive for firms to innovate in order to escape competition, so that PMC has a positive effect on growth; second, that a little imitation is almost always growth-enhancing, as it promotes more frequent neck-and-neck competition, but too much imitation is unambiguously growth-reducing.

Consecutive stage economies are linked by a mapping (""transition function"") which determines the next period's participation structure from the preceding period's participation. The transition function generates a dynamic process of market participation which is driven by the percentage of informed traders and the rate at which a new asset is adopted. We then analyse the evolutionary stability of stationary equilibria. In accordance with the empirical literature on financial innovation, it is obtained that the success of a financial innovation, a mutation, depends on a sufficiently high trading volume, marketing, and new and differentiated hedging opportunities.

The two most striking characteristics of the decade are (a) a large increase in the college/high school wage gap, and (b) a substantial rise in the variance of wage residuals. While this second phenomenon is typically implicitly attributed to an increase in the demand for unobserved skill, most work in this area fails to acknowledge that this same increase in demand for unobserved skill could drive the evolution of the measured college premium. In its simplest form, if higher ability individuals are more likely to attend college, then the increase in the college wage premium may be due to a increase in the relative demand for high ability workers rather than an increase in the demand for skills accumulated in college. This paper develops and estimates a dynamic programming selection model in order to investigate the plausibility of this explanation. The results are highly suggestive that an increase in the demand for unobserved ability could play a major role in the growing college premium.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a68_3ay_3a2001_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a665-691..htm,10.1111/1467-937X.00185

When performance is unverifiable, use of promotion reduces the incentive for managers to be affected by influence activities that would blunt the effectiveness of monetary bonuses. When employees are risk neutral, use of promotion for incentives need not distort assignments. When they are risk averse, it may—sufficient conditions for this are given. The distortion may be either to promote more employees than is efficient (the Peter Principle effect) or fewer. ""Promotions serve two roles in an organization. First, they help assign people to the roles where they can best contribute to the organization's performance. Second, promotions serve as incentives and rewards.""

This paper investigates the possibility that such a reorganization is tied to the integration of economic markets. The paper describes a model where heterogeneous individuals form coalitions for the provision of a public good and shows that the number and composition of these jurisdictions depend on the overall size of the market. The range of economic activities engaged in by jurisdiction members increases when the size of the market increases, and so does the range of their preferences over the public good. The result is a change in the endogenous borders of the jurisdictions, and a reorganization of all coalitions. The optimal number of jurisdictions is unique and increases with market size. In the absence of compensating transfers, however, the decentralized equilibrium need not be optimal and is not unique, although there is no restriction on individuals' ability to coordinate the formation of coalitions. It remains true that a large enough increase in market size will trigger an increase in the number of jurisdictions.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a68_3ay_3a2001_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a83-108..htm,10.1111/1467-937X.00161

This paper models the formation of legal standards that determine the extent of civil liberty in a society. It is shown that tolerant legal standards emerge over time, despite all individuals having intolerant preferences. Each period citizens choose activities that have social consequences. A majority vote determines which of these activities are legally protected. Because of errors in interpreting the symbolic content of these activities, voters from the majority will not impose excessively intolerant standards, otherwise they may end up severely punishing members of their own group by mistake. Extending this framework to a dynamic model, we examine Markovian equilibria of the game when government improves with time in its ability to correctly interpret citizens' activities. These improvements allow an unchanging majority to impose increasingly intolerant standards over time. It is shown that societies with high political turnover due to population changes are apt to choose tolerant legal standards. Societies with low turnover are more apt to choose more intolerant and unstable ones. Each group seeks to prevent auditing capabilities of government from improving too much over time in order to prevent future majorities from successfully enforcing more intolerant standards.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a68_3ay_3a2001_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a109-132..htm,10.1111/1467-937X.00162

Our key assumption is that workers must engage in costly search in order to gather information about jobs (Stigler (1961)). In equilibrium, some firms adopt high fixed cost, high productivity technologies, offer high wages, and fill job openings quickly. Other firms adopt less capital-intensive technologies and offer low wages, hiring mostly uninformed workers. In equilibrium, the amount of wage dispersion leaves workers indifferent about whether to gather information, and the fraction of informed workers leaves firms indifferent about their wage and technology choice.

(1951), Scarf (1959)), has recently received renewed attention both in the durable consumption and in the investment and labour demand literatures. Caballero (1993), for instance, appeals to these type of models to explain the time series properties of durable expenditure and, in particular, the persistence or ""slow adjustment"" of such a variable. In this paper, I model the purchase behaviour of automobiles by U.S. households as an (S, s) rule. I estimate a flexible specification of such a rule using a large microeconomic data set and study some of the aggregate implications of this type of inertial behaviour. The paper is one of the first attempts at estimating directly the parameters of an (S, s) rule using micro data.' Because of this, some of the methodological issues concerning the specification and the estimation of (S, s) rules are relevant for many potential applications. Furthermore, the paper is one of the first to discuss and quantify the aggregate implications of an (S, s) rule estimated on micro data. In the presence of non-convex transaction costs, a full and consistent characterization of individual behaviour is very hard and typically requires strong restrictions. Grossman and Laroque (1991) prove that an (S, s) rule is optimal for a consumption and investment problem under very special circumstances. Some of their results were extended by Eberly (1991) and Beaulieu (1993a, b). Eberly (1991), in particular, has derived some closed-form solutions for durable consumption in the presence of transaction costs while Caballero and Engel (1994) construct a model of investment where an (S, s) rule is optimal. The main problem with these theoretical results is that it is only possible to show optimality of (S, s) rules under very stringent conditions. In particular, a necessary condition to derive them is that the optimization problem faced by an individual consumer can be reduced to a problem with a single state variable. Unfortunately, as pointed out by Bar-Ilan and Blinder (1992), even simple generalizations are extremely difficult to analyse",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a67_3ay_3a2000_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a667-696..htm,10.1111/1467-937X.00149

With risk aversion of entrepreneurs as well as the intermediary, financial intermediation provides insurance as well as finance. In contrast to earlier results on optimal intermediation policies under risk neutrality, the paper shows that when an intermediary is financing many entrepreneurs with independent returns, optimal intermediation policies must shift return risks away from risk averse entrepreneurs and impose them on the intermediary or on final investors.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a67_3ay_3a2000_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a719-742..htm,10.1111/1467-937X.00151

1215,Review of Economic Studies,Asymmetric Auctions,"['Eric Maskin', 'John Riley']","2000, vol. 67, issue 3, 413-438",[],"The revenue-equivalence theorem' for auctions predicts that expected seller revenue is independent of the bidding rules, as long as equilibrium has the properties that the buyer with the highest reservation price wins and any buyer with the lowest possible reservation price has zero expected surplus. Thus, in particular, the two most common auction institutions-the open ""English"" auction and the sealed high-bid auction are equivalent despite their rather different strategic properties. This strong prediction of equivalence seems at odds, however, with the empirical observation that rarely is any given kind of commodity sold through more than one sort of auction. Thus, for example, art is nearly always auctioned off according to the English rules, whereas job contracts are normally awarded through sealed bids. Admittedly, in the public sector, there have been a few attempts to use both methods (lumber contracts in the Pacific Northwest) or to switch from one to the other (Treasury Bills). But changes have typically met great resistance. This is also in conflict with theory, since a corollary of the revenue equivalence theorem is that the expected surplus for any buyer is the same in the two auctions. These discrepancies suggest that the hypotheses of the revenue-equivalence theorem may be too strong. The principal assumptions are (i) risk neutrality, (ii) independence of different buyers' private signals about the item's value, (iii) lack of collusion among buyers, and (iv) symmetry of buyers' beliefs. Over the last fifteen years, a number of papers have explored the implications of relaxing these assumptions. Typically a clear-cut prediction has emerged in each of these papers in favour of either the high-bid or open auction. Thus under increasingly general assumptions, Holt (1980), Riley and Samuelson (1981), and Maskin and Riley (1984) show that, when buyers are risk averse, the high-bid auction should be favoured by a seller even if he also exhibits risk aversion.2 In turn, the assumption of independence of private signals of the item's value is relaxed by Milgrom and Weber (1982).

We make three major points. First, we extend the relationship between price discrimination and optimal auctions from the single-product case to the multiple-product case. A monopolist setting prices for multiple products may offer discounts on purchases of bundles of products; similarly, the optimal auction of multiple products facilitates price discrimination by allocating products inefficiently to customers who are willing to purchase both products. Second, we demonstrate that optimal auctions are qualitatively distinct from monopoly sales of multiple products. Because of uncertainty about the values of other consumers, two products are bundled probabilistically in an optimal auction for a customer who is willing to buy both of them. A customer may then receive a discount on a lower-valued product without receiving a higher-valued product. Third, we show that in an optimal auction of two products the allocation of one product may vary with the amount of competition for the other product.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a67_3ay_3a2000_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a483-497..htm,10.1111/1467-937X.00140

The first contribution of this paper is an investigation of the consequences of relaxing both the linearity and the additivity assumption for the interpretation of linear instrumental variables estimators. Without these assumptions, the standard linear instrumental variables estimator identifies a weighted average of the derivative of the behavioural relationship of interest. A second contribution is the formulation of critical identifying assumptions in terms of demand and supply at different prices and instruments, rather than in terms of functional-form specific residuals. Our approach to the simultaneous equations problem and the average-derivative interpretation of instrumental variables estimates is illustrated by estimating the demand for fresh whiting at the Fulton fish market.

We analyse a simple security design model in which the number and payoff of securities are endogenous. Agents have rational expectations and differ in information, endowments, and attitudes toward risk. When markets are incomplete, equilibrium prices are typically partially revealing, while full relevation is attained with complete markets. The optimality of complete or incomplete markets depends on whether the adverse selection effect (the unwillingness of agents to trade risks when they are informationally disadvantaged) is stronger or weaker than the Hirshleifer effect (the impossibility of trading risks that have already been resolved), as new securities are issued and prices reveal more information.

We illustrate this in a version of Matsuyama's (1991) two-sector model with increasing returns to scale. Two main results are shown.

The formal analysis uses two new measures, the radius and modified coradius, to characterize the long run stochastically stable set of an evolutionary model and to bound the speed with which evolutionary change occurs. Though not universally powerful, the result can be used to make many previous analyses more transparent and extends them by providing results on waiting times.

The model produces new economic insights beyond the well-known bilateral model of Krugman (1991), which is obtained as a special case. The paper also introduces a new class of stochastic processes in economics, namely multidimensional reflected diffusion processes. Two main features characterize the economics of exchange rates in a multilateral target zone. (i) The restrictions on interventions imposed by cross-currency constraints: when one country changes its money supply, say because its exchange rate with a second country has hit its band, all exchange rates involving the currency of that particular country will be affected, regardless of their position within their respective bands, (ii) Cooperation in sharing the intervention burden: in general, the exchange rate between any two countries will depend on the fundamentals of third countries in a multilateral target zone. This is because if the monetary authorities intervene together, a shock in the fundamentals of any country will induce a revision of the expectation of future interventions of other countries. The model reverts the counterfactual predictions of the bilateral model that the exchange rate steady-state density should be U-shaped and that its volatility should be a decreasing function of the distance of the exchange rate to the limits of its band. Thus, accounting for the multilateral feature of real-world target zones allows us to reconcile target zone models with the most salient empirical features of exchange rate behaviour.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a67_3ay_3a2000_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a193-211..htm,10.1111/1467-937X.00127

Workers cannot commit to turning down such offers. Offers are private, so that workers are unable to use one firm's offer in an attempt to elicit better offers from other firms. In the unique sequential equilibrium outcome of the model with unproductive education, there is no wasteful education. When education is productive, the standard model predicts that more able individuals become overeducated to separate themselves from less able workers. In our model, less able workers become overeducated to (partially) pool with more able workers. The pooling mutes the incentives of high ability workers, who in consequence actually choose to become undereducated.

At issue is whether voluntary or compulsory procedures are more likely to prevail over time. We model infinitely lived individuals who make repeated, sequential location decisions over one of two communities. Each community uses a distinct mechanism for allocating public goods. The first is one in which contributions are given voluntarily by the citizenry of the community. The second is a compulsory scheme by which individuals are taxed proportionately to wealth with the tax determined by a majority vote. Opportunities to accumulate wealth exist via accumulation of public capital. The Markov Perfect equilibria of the dynamic game are studied. Our main result shows that when accumulated wealth converges to a steady state, individuals' locational choices eventually ""select"" the involuntary provision mechanism. This holds despite the fact that unanimous location in the voluntary provision community may in many cases remain as a Nash equilibrium of the static game each period. We also describe conditions under which voluntary provision survives. These conditions require that accumulation of capital fails to decrease wealth dispersion over time.

Sraffian indeterminacy and the generic finiteness of the number of equilibria are reconciled by showing that indeterminacy occurs at a measure-zero set of endowments.

This literature usually assumes that contractual incompleteness is due to the transaction costs of describing—or of even foreseeing—the possible states of nature in advance. We argue, however, that such transaction costs need not interfere with optimal contracting (i.e. transaction costs need not be relevant), provided that agents can probabilistically forecast their possible future payoffs (even if other aspects of the state of the nature cannot be forecast). In other words, all that is required for optimality is that agents be able to perform dynamic programming, an assumption always invoked by the incomplete contract literature.

Building on Hart-Moore (1999), we provide conditions under which an optimal contract consists of nothing more than an assignment of property rights. We also examine the robustness of some of the literature's standard predictions about asset ownership to the introduction of mechanisms for eliciting parties' ex post willingness to pay for the assets (such as options or financial markets).

In the model, the person's productive abilities are revealed over time through observations of performance. There are no explicit output-contingent contracts, but since the wage in each period is based on expected output and expected output depends on assessed ability, an ""implicit contract"" links today's performance to future wages. An incentive problem arises from the person's ability and desire to influence the learning process, and therefore the wage process, by taking unobserved actions that affect today's performance. The fundamental incongruity in preferences is between the individual's concern for human capital returns and the firm's concern for financial returns. The two need be only weakly related. It is shown that career motives can be beneficial as well as detrimental, depending on how well the two kinds of capital returns are aligned.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a66_3ay_3a1999_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a169-182..htm,10.1111/1467-937X.00083

There is a modern sector, where productivity is high but information asymmetries are large, and a traditional sector where productivity is low but information asymmetries are small. Consequently, agency costs in the modern sector make consumption lending difficult, while such lending is readily done in the traditional sector. The resulting trade-off between credit availability and productivity implies that not everyone will move to the modern sector. In fact, the laissez-faire level of modernization may fail to maximize net social surplus. This situation may also hold in the long run: in a dynamic version of the model, a ""trickle-down"" effect links the process of modernization with reduction in modern sector agency costs. This effect may be too weak and the economy may get stuck in a trap and never fully modernize. The two-sector structure also yields a natural theoretical testing ground for the Kuznets inverted-U hypothesis: we show that even within the ""sectoral shifting"" class of models, this phenomenon is not robust to small changes in model specification.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a65_3ay_3a1998_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a631-653..htm,10.1111/1467-937X.00062

Surprisingly, there does not exist a labour contract based model that is consistent with predictions (a) and (b). In fact, the standard results in the literature are if leisure is a normal good then there will be too much employment in essentially all states of the world and the welfare of the worker declines as the state of the world improves. In this paper a labour contracting model is constructed that is consistent with the above mentioned predictions. Two necessary ingredients in the model are the possibility of financial distress in low demand states and ""partial provability"" in contracting. Financial distress can be viewed as frustrating renegotiation and, thus, inefficient outcomes are possible in equilibrium. Partial provability—the ability of an informed player to make verifiable claims or statements to an uninformed player—eliminates certain kinds of inefficient outcomes. In particular, it eliminates the possibility that, in equilibrium, there is too much employment. This last result is interesting in itself because it is commonly believed that normality of leisure necessarily implies that labour contracting models will generate employment levels that are too high from an efficiency perspective.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a65_3ay_3a1998_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a817-845..htm,10.1111/1467-937X.00070

In these equilibria, jump bids serve as correlating devices which select asymmetric bidding functions to be played subsequently. Each possibility of jump bidding provides a Pareto improvement for the bidders from the symmetric equilibrium of a sealed bid, second-price auction. The expanded set of equilibria can approximate either first- or second-price outcomes and produce exactly the set of expected prices between those two bounds.

In our two-region model of migration, desirable concentration fails to occur under some conditions, and undesirable concentration occurs in others. In the latter case, even though the individuals collectively prefer to be distributed evenly across the two regions, they end up concentrating into one region in their pursuit of a better life. Hence, the freedom to move can be self-defeating. We characterize the conditions for such self-defeating concentration to occur. The coordination failures between the entry decision of service firms and the migration decision of individuals are caused by the incompleteness of markets due to the endogeneity of the range of services available, which deprive the agents of the opportunity to signal demand and supply for potential services. The argument does not rely on price distortions, the nonconvexities implied by increasing returns and nontradedness, congestion externalities, nor myopia in migration decisions.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a65_3ay_3a1998_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a211-234..htm,10.1111/1467-937X.00042

This paper studies the relationship between bureaucracy and financial constraints as two such mechanisms. The lack of commitment to hard financial constraints interferes with its ex post screening capability; ex ante bureaucratic screening is optimally chosen as a substitute. However, bureaucracy makes mistakes by rejecting promising projects and delays innovation, and the efficiency loss due to soft financial constraints increases as prior knowledge becomes worse and as research stage investment requirements become lower. In a centralized economy, bureaucracy may reduce the number of parallel projects, particularly for projects with higher uncertainties and less research stage requirements. This theory fits much of the evidence and in particular it explains why the computer industry, but not the nuclear or aerospace industries, has fared so poorly in centralized economies.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a65_3ay_3a1998_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a151-164..htm,10.1111/1467-937X.00039

We explore two methods for supplementing the information in these inequalities based on assumptions about participant decision-making processes and about the strength in dependence between outcomes in the participation and non-participation states. Dependence is produced as a consequence of rational choice by participants.

Social programmes mandating homogeneous treatment of the population are of interest, but so are ones in which treatment varies across the population.

We extend these results by showing that under these assumptions one can estimate more from the data than the average causal effect for the subpopulation of compliers; one can, in principle, estimate the entire marginal distribution of the outcome under different treatments for this subpopulation. These distributions might be useful for a policy maker who wishes to take into account not only differences in average of earnings when contemplating the merits of one job training programme vs. another. We also show that the standard instrumental variables estimator implicitly estimates these underlying outcome distributions without imposing the required nonnegativity on these implicit density estimates, and that imposing non-negativity can substantially alter the estimates of the local average treatment effect. We illustrate these points by presenting an analysis of the returns to a high school education using quarter of birth as an instrument. We show that the standard instrumental variables estimates implicitly estimate the outcome distributions to be negative over a substantial range, and that the estimates of the local average treatment effect change considerably when we impose nonnegativity in any of a variety of ways.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a64_3ay_3a1997_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a555-574..htm,10.2307/2971731

Miscarriages might not meet all of the conditions required for an instrumental variable to identify such causal effects for all of the observations in our sample. However, it is an appropriate instrumental variable for some women, namely those pregnant women who experience a random miscarriage. Although information from typical data sources does not allow one to identify these women, we show that one can adapt results from Horowitz and Manski (1995) on identification with data from contaminated samples to construct informative bounds on the causal effect of teenage childbearing. We use these bounds to re-examine the effects of early chilbearing on the teen mother's subsequent educational and labour market attainment as considered in Hotz, McElroy and Sanders (1995a, 1995b).

We decompose the conventional measure of programme evaluation bias into several components and find that bias due to selection on unobservables, commonly called selection bias in econometrics, is empirically less important than other components, although it is still a sizeable fraction of the estimated programme impact. Matching methods applied to comparison groups located in the same labour markets as participants and administered the same questionnaire eliminate much of the bias as conventionally measured, but the remaining bias is a considerable fraction of experimentally-determined programme impact estimates.

Second, it is straightforward to derive the distribution of the estimator under general misspecification. Third, some of the alternative estimators have appealing information-theoretic interpretations. In particular, one of the estimators is an empirical likelihood estimator with an interpretation as a discrete support maximum likelihood estimator.

Moral hazard with limited wealth constraints on the part of the borrowers is the source of both capital market imperfections and the emergence of persistent income inequalities. Three main conclusions are obtained from this model. First, when the rate of capital accumulation is sufficiently high, the economy converges to a unique invariant wealth distribution. Second, even though the trickle-down mechanism can lead to a unique steady-state distribution under laissez-faire, there is room for government intervention: in particular, redistribution of wealth from rich lenders to poor and middle-class borrowers improves the production efficiency of the economy both because it brings about greater equality of opportunity and also because it accelerates the trickle-down process.

Introducing credit rationing into the Solow model modifies these conclusions. Multiple stationary interest rates and wealth distributions can exist because higher initial rates can be self-reinforcing through higher credit rationing and lower capital accumulation. The wealth accumulation process is ergodic in every steady state, but wealth mobility is lower with higher steady-state interest rates. Aggregate output is higher in steady states with lower interest rates because credit is better allocated.

This is so even though the speed of learning θ from prices becomes arbitrarily slow as autocorrelation approaches a unit root level. It follows then that learning the unknown parameter θ and convergence of the equilibrium process to the FIE are not equivalent. Moreover, allowing for non-stationary processes of shocks, the distinction takes a more stark form. Learning θ is neither necessary nor sufficient for convergence to the FIE. When the process of shocks has a unit root, convergence to the FIE occurs but θ can not be learned.

When income distribution is not degenerate, however, the same model gives rise to a surprising wealth of results. In particular, poor economies with high inequality may exhibit completely counter-intuitive patterns of fiscal policy and external borrowing. The country's production path declines over time, because the more mobile agents leave the country to escape taxation; yet, the country might end up having a budget deficit and borrowing from abroad, thereby reinforcing rather than smoothing the asymmetry in consumption between the two periods. An important feature of this outcome is that it is backed by both the poor and the rich, who gain from the fiscal system at the expense of the middle class.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a63_3ay_3a1996_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a411-433..htm,10.2307/2297889

We use local asymptotic analyses to explain why the Phillips-Perron tests suffer from severe size distortions regardless of the choice of the spectral density estimator but that the modified statistics show dramatic improvements in size when used in conjunction with a particular formulation an autoregressive spectral density estimator. We explain why kernel based spectral density estimators aggravate the size problem in the Phillips-Perron tests and yield no size improvement to the modified statistics. The local asymptotic power of the modified statistics are also evaluated.

Players are initially randomly matched with no knowledge of each other's past actions; they endogenously decide whether or not to continue the repeated relationship. There is incomplete information regarding player types: a subset of the population is myopic, while the remainder have discount factors that permit cooperation, in principle. We define social equilibrium in such communities. Such equilibria are characterized by an initial testing phase, followed by cooperation if the test is successful. It is precisely the presence of myopic types that permit cooperation, by raising barriers to entry into new relationships. We examine the implications of increased patience, which takes two forms: an increase in the number of non-myopic types, and an increase in the discount factor of non-myopic types. These two notions turn out to have strikingly different implications for the degree of cooperation that can be sustained.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a63_3ay_3a1996_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a491-519..htm,10.2307/2297892

Endogenous delay thus prolongs the recovery from a recession and heightens the effect of the boom. This paper describes a dynamic model that exhibits both delay and cycles and develops methods for analysing the role of delay in propogating business cycles. A number of interesting characteristics of the cycle are revealed. First, the effect of delay is asymmetric: it lengthens the recovery but not the downturn. Second, delay can increase the amplitude and typically reduces the frequency of the cycle. Third, it can reduce the average level of activity, but it achieves this effect by prolonging the recession rather than by reducing the amplitude of the cycle.

The estimation results indicate that the utility gains to marriage are decreasing in the female's wage rate and increasing in her (potential) husband's earnings, while the opposite is found for gains to working.

In particular, we find that the equilibrium is characterized by a long cycle of stagnation and growth. Over this cycle, incumbent innovators have sufficient political influence that new technologies are prohibited, and only as these incumbents are phased out of the economy will new innovation occur.

Trade occurs as a result of equilibrium actions in a Bayesian game, where uncertainty is captured by a finite state space and information is represented by partitions on this space. In the benchmark case of trade with common knowledge of endowments, the two mechanisms deliver virtually identical outcomes. However, with differential information, the dealership market has strictly higher trading volume, and yields an efficient post-trade allocation in most states. In contrast, the decentralized market suffers from suboptimal trading volume. The reason for this poor performance is the vulnerability of the decentralized market to higher-order uncertainty concerning the fundamentals of the market. Traders may know that mutually beneficial trade is feasible, and perhaps know that they know, and yet a failure of common knowledge that this is so precludes efficient trade.

The main results of the paper are that (1) the equilibrium is characterized by separation but nevertheless the modalities of financing depend critically on the market's priors about the project's riskiness, in particular, the amount of collateral posted by the entrepreneur varies with the market's prior perceptions about the project, (2) when the market is optimistic about the project, there exists a unique equilibrium outcome, it is separating, but the standard incentivecompatibility constraints are not binding, (3) even if the market is very pessimistic about a project's chances of success, there always exists an equilibrium in which a good project receives sufficient financing, that is, the market does not collapse due to a Lemons effect, (4) the entrepreneur's inability to commit not to recontract may be considered Pareto improving in certain situations.

In deciding whether to undertake an IPO, and what fraction of ownership to retain, the initial owner must balance two factors. By selling to dispersed shareholders, he maximizes his proceeds from the sale of cash flow rights. However, by directly bargaining with a potential buyer, he maximizes his proceeds from the sale of control rights. Whether a company should be private or public, as well as the insider's ownership in public companies, depends on the particular combination of majority control and dispersed ownership which maximizes the incumbent's wealth. The model provides implications on the strategy to be followed in selling a company as well as on the timing of IPOs and going-private transactions.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a62_3ay_3a1995_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a425-448..htm,10.2307/2298036

This paper predicts large investors will ""create their own space"" by staking out large enough blocks to deter other block investors, there will be a threshold level above which large investors are not challenged, and that the shareholder structure across firms will exhibit a particular clientele effect among block shareholders.

In addition to being of policy interest, this is a theoretically challenging problem since it requires solving a multi-dimensional screening problem. The solution that we find is strikingly simple. It separates the poor into two categories, with the lower income groups subject to workfare while facing a 100% marginal tax rate on earnings.

However, as argued by Coase, these problems may be mitigated in a decentralized system through voluntary coordination. We show how coordination is limited by the combination of two factors: respect for individual autonomy and the existence of private information. Together they imply that efficient outcomes can only be achieved through coordination when external effects are relatively large. Moreover, there are instances in which coordination cannot yield any improvement at all, despite common knowledge that social gains from agreement exist. This occurs when external effects are relatively small, and this may help to explain why coordination is so seldom observed in practice. When improvements are possible, we describe how simple subsidies can be used to implement second-best solutions and explain why standard solutions, such as Pigovian taxes, cannot be used.

Many studies have documented that public higher education involves a transfer in the reverse direction. We show that this pattern of redistribution is an equilibrium outcome in a model in which education is only partially publicly provided and individuals vote over the extent to which it is subsidized. We characterize economies in which poorer individuals are effectively excluded from obtaining an education and their tax payments help offset the cost of education obtained by others. We show that increased inequality in the income distribution makes this outcome more likely and that the efficiency implications of this exclusion depend on the wealth of the economy.,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a62_3ay_3a1995_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a249-262..htm,10.2307/2297804

The model provides an interpretation of the observations on duration to first job and accepted wages that differentiates between behavioural influences and market fundamentals in determining the accepted wage-schooling relationship. The return to schooling is appropriately measured by differences in the wage offer distribution, which depends only on market fundamentals. We use data from the 1979 youth cohort of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience to follow several school-leaving cohorts of young males. A model which allows for five types of heterogeneous workers within schooling/race groups fits the duration and wage data well for all such groups.

In the model there is both imperfect information and imperfect competition. When vertical integration by the monopolist is allowed, the regulator's task is made harder insofar as the monopolist has anticompetitive incentives to raise rivals' costs. On the other hand, integration may lead to there being fewer firms in the deregulated sector and hence less duplication of fixed costs. The overall welfare comparison between separation and integration is ambiguous, as two simple examples illustrate.

We show that an equilibrium exists if there is a price system under which no investor has an arbitrage opportunity. A similar result has been previously known to hold in finite asset markets. Our extension to infinite assets involves a concept of an arbitrage opportunity which is different from the one used in finite markets. An arbitrage opportunity in finite asset markets is a portfolio that guarantees non-negative payoff in every event, positive payoff in some event, and has zero price. For the case of infinite asset markets, we introduce a concept of sequential arbitrage opportunity which is a sequence of portfolios which increases an investor's utility indefinitely and has zero price in the limit.

Producers' anticipations of paying monopoly fees for infrastructure services dampen their incentive to invest in DPAs and may prevent the economy from reaching a minimal level of activity that would justify investment in a large indivisible infrastructure; and potential investors in infrastructure may be intimidated by the prospect of expropriatory regulation. Thus a credible prior commitment to effective but fair regulation is necessary for achieving optimal growth. But it may not be sufficient.

When the cost of producing the public good is convex, this mechanism is strategy-proof (even with respect to coalitions), anonymous and induces voluntary participation. No other mechanism shares these three properties. When the public good is excludable (its cost still convex), there is a mechanism with the same properties, that everyone prefers to conservative equal costs.

An efficient public good decision can always be accomplished by a majority voting scheme, where the number of ""YES"" votes required depends on the welfare weights in a simple way. The results are shown to have a natural geometry and an intuitive interpretation. We also extend these results to allow for restrictions on feasible transfer rules, ranging from the traditional unlimited transfers to the extreme case of no transfers. For a range of welfare weights, an optimal scheme is a two-stage procedure which combines a voting stage with a second stage where an even-chance lottery is used to determine who pays. We call this the ""lottery draft mechanism"" Since such a cost-sharing scheme does not require transfers, it follows that in many cases transfers are not necessary to achieve the optimal allocation. For other ranges of welfare weights the second stage is more complicated, but the voting stage remains the same. If transfers are completely infeasible, randomized voting rules may be optimal.

There exists a pair of rationalizable sets of pure strategies for the seller and the buyer which are weakly stationary. We demonstrate that any initial offer from the seller induced by a strategy rationalized by a weakly stationary acceptance rule for the buyer must entail the Coase property.

Any agreements or contracts then undertaken by the transnational company and the host country must be designed to be self-enforcing. It could be possible for the host country and the transnational corporation to find such self-enforcing agreements if there are future gains from trade. Thus although the host country might have a short-term incentive to expropriate, it has a long-term incentive to foster good relations with potential investors to attract more investment in the future. This conflict between short-term and long-term incentives determines the type of investment contracts agreed. This paper extends previous work on the general underprovision of investment when contracts are incomplete or only partially enforceable (see e.g. Grout (1984)) to a dynamic context. It is likewise shown that investment is initially underprovided but it increases over time and for certain parameter values it tends to the efficient level.

The model has three main features. First, very different patterns of income distribution are conducive to high growth at different levels of per capita income. Second, growth is associated with an externality whereby investment in human capital by one group increases the productivity of other groups, thus potentially enabling them to invest in human capital. Third, the initial pattern of income distribution and the resulting political equilibrium are crucial in determining whether the transmission of this externality is promoted, in which case growth is enhanced, or prevented, in which case growth is stopped. Using a non-overlapping generations model with voting, I derive several empirical implications.

An important issue in this debate concerns the circumstances in which deviations from fundamentals are consistent with rational behaviour. When there is asymmetric information between investors and portfolio managers, portfolio managers have an incentive to churn; their trades are not motivated by changes in information, liquidity needs or risk sharing but rather by a desire to profit at the expense of the investors that hire them.

The stochastic evolution of the state of competition depends on the respective effort rates of the firms. The question is whether the current leader works harder than the laggard—does the ‘gap’ between firms tend to increase or decrease? We show that several effects are at work. The state tends to evolve in the direction where joint payoffs are greater. Since joint payoffs are related to joint product-market profits less joint effort costs, there are two classes of effect: the joint-profit effect and various joint-cost effects. The latter result in part from the pattern of profits, and in part from endpoint effects that give relief from efforts. Asymptotic expansions illuminate these influences. Moreover, we show by numerical simulation that there is another kind of joint-cost effect. The pattern of joint effort costs can influence the pattern of evolution of market structure, and the evolution of the pattern of market structure can influence the pattern of efforts, in a mutually self-reinforcing manner. In particular, there may be equilibria in which this last effect means that the laggard works harder than the leader even though all the other effects work in favour of the leader.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a60_3ay_3a1993_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a543-573..htm,10.2307/2298124

Second, approximate efficiency is shown to be achievable in a large class of partnerships, including ones with smooth and monotonic production and disutility functions. Approximate efficiency is achieved by mixed-strategy equilibria: one partner takes, with small probability, an inefficient action. The degree to which efficiency is approximated is restricted only by the amount of liability the partners can bear.

However, even when these sources of aggregation bias are corrected for, the estimates of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution obtained from aggregate data remain lower than those obtained from average cohort data, and excess sensitivity tests reject the implications of the model.

As long as this decision mechanism is responsive to a unanimous preference by shareholders, shareholder control is consistent with but stronger than value maximization. Next, the particular institution of majority voting by shareholders is examined. It is shown that for generic economies, a majority rule equilibrium for a firm implies that production is optimal for the largest, or dominant, shareholder. Finally, a more realistic control mechanism is considered in which majority voting by shareholders is constrained by a group of shareholders, or Board of Directors, who control the voting agenda.

Specifically, we study an example in which there is an investment project with returns only known to a few people. These people have a cost of undertaking the project and this cost is private information. The only information the other agents receive is that someone else has invested. They are not told whether that person actually knew the returns, or whether he too was just acting on the basis of his observation of others. They use their optimal Bayesian decision rule to decide whether to invest. We show that, for a wide class of alternative specifications, this decision rule has the property that a positive fraction of those who observe the rumour will not invest.

That is, the welfare bound implied by the revelation principle is virtually attainable in offer/counteroffer bargaining. The main condition needed for this result is a monotone-hazard-rate assumption about the distribution of types.

The employer makes contract offers which employees can accept or reject. Once a contract has been accepted it is impossible for the employer to exchange messages with individual employees. On the unique stationary equilibrium path for the contracting game, the employer chooses between two mutually exclusive outcomes. In the market outcome, the employer offers long-term contracts and information is conveyed entirely through self-selection and delayed production. In the monitoring outcome, the employer offers short-term contracts, and contract renegotiation is conditioned by an employee's past performance. A simple characterization theorem is provided which illustrates the often surprising effects of improvements in information in this setting. For example, an employer who is initially offering short-term contracts to exploit performance information may stop monitoring and shift to market screening when the monitoring technology becomes more informative.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a60_3ay_3a1993_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a149-174..htm,10.2307/2297816

We then consider sustainable equilibria in which both government and private agent decision rules are required to be sequentially rational. We adapt Abreu's (1988) optimal trigger strategies to completely characterize the entire set of sustainable equilibria. In particular, we show that when there is sufficiently little discounting and government consumption fluctuates enough, the Ramsey allocations and policies (in which the government never defaults) can be supported by a sustainable equilibrium. By way of an example we show that the larger the variance of government consumption the easier it is to support good outcomes. We also show for moderate discount factors that in the best sustainable equilibrium, tax rates are more volatile and debt is smaller than in the Ramsey equilibrium.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a60_3ay_3a1993_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a175-195..htm,10.2307/2297817

If the social rate of return on investment exceeds the private return, then tax policies that encourage investment can raise the growth rate and levels of utility. An excess of the social return over the private return can reflect learning-by-doing with spillover effects, the financing of government consumption purchases with an income tax, and monopoly pricing of new types of capital goods. Tax incentives for investment are not called for if the private rate of return on investment equals the social return. This situation applies in growth models if the accumulation of a broad concept of capital does not entail diminishing returns, or if technological progress appears as an expanding variety of consumer products. In growth models that incorporate public services, the optimal tax policy hinges on the characteristics of the services. If the public services are publicly-provided private goods, which are rival and excludable, or publicly-provided public goods, which are non-rival and non-excludable, then lump-sum taxation is superior to income taxation. Many types of public goods are subject to congestion, and are therefore rival but to some extent non-excludable. In these cases, income taxation works approximately as a user fee and can therefore be superior to lump-sum taxation. In particular, the incentives for investment and growth are too high if taxes are lump sum. We argue that the congestion model applies to a wide array of public expenditures, including transportation facilities, public utilities, courts, and possibly national defence and police.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a59_3ay_3a1992_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a645-661..htm,10.2307/2297991

We analyse the problem of an agenda-setting reform-minded Government facing a bureaucracy or industrial sector for which allocative efficiency requires redundancies and an increase in work intensity. The Government also tries to minimize the rents conceded to its heterogeneous workforce. We examine two types of political constraints: unanimity rule and majority rule, both in a one-period and a two-period horizon. The main results are the following. First of all, we show how adverse selection and time-consistency may generate the widely-observed feature of gradualism as an ingredient of an optimal reform. Second, under a majority rule, it is shown to be possible for the Government to obtain a majority vote for a reform scheme that intertemporally hurts majority interests. Indeed, the Government can improve rent extraction through the strategic use of the threat of future proposals: the group which expects to be in the minority tomorrow may accept concessions, while its votes can be used to extract rents from another group. These results suggest that, in a dynamic context, democratic constraints should not be overestimated as an obstacle against efficiency-enhancing economic reforms.

It is shown that if all mechanisms are considered and preferences satisfy a basic condition, then any social choice correspondence can be implemented in undominated strategies. An example points out that the strength of this result derives from the use of mechanisms with questionable features. In part of the message space the agent who announces the highest integer is rewarded. This sort of ""tail-chasing"" construction, common in the constructive proofs of the literature, is used to assure that undesired strategy combinations do not form an equilibrium. If such mechanisms are ruled out, then the social choice correspondences which can be implemented in undominated strategies satisfy an incentive compatibility type condition called strategy-resistence. For social choice functions this is equivalent to strategy-proofness. This contrast suggests that this issue should be examined as it applies to other solution concepts used in implementation theory.

A key feature is that aggregate output and borrowers' ""financial capacity"" —the maximum overhang of past debt they may feasibly carry—are determined jointly, much in the spirit of Gurley and Shaw (1955). Expectations of future economic conditions govern financial capacity which in turn may constrain current production, especially in bad times. A small but persistent shift in aggregate conditions may have a large impact on financial capacity, making the framework capable of motivating large endogenous fluctuations in financial constraints.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a59_3ay_3a1992_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a455-472..htm,10.2307/2297859

Both agents have potentially conflicting objectives since the entrepreneur cares about both pecuniary and non-pecuniary returns from the project while the investor is only concerned about monetary returns. We address the questions of (i) whether and how the initial contract can be structured in such a way as to bring about a perfect coincidence of objectives between both agents (ii) when the initial contract cannot achieve this coincidence of objectives how should control rights be allocated to achieve efficiency? One of the main results of our analysis concerns the optimality properties of the (contingent) control allocation induced by standard debt financing.,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a59_3ay_3a1992_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a473-494..htm,10.2307/2297860

We exhibit sufficient conditions under which linear reward schedules implement a given mechanism.

Elements of competitive selection appear in the pricing theory of real or financial assets and in the determination of wage rates, where prices correlate the characteristics of the asset or job with those of the individuals, under the equilibrium allocation. If prices achieve such an allocation, then regressions with price as dependent variable are prima facie ""mixed-index"" in character, with adverse bias or consistency properties, no matter that the right-hand regressors are apparently exogenous. We set up a paradigm for competitive selection and use the concepts so generated to codify the conditions under which mixed index bias will occur.

Firms choose price in each period using strategies that depend on prices chosen in the previous period. Periodically, unanticipated demand shocks precipitate price wars. When shocks occur, the firms in the market must determine the new demand conditions and adjust their strategies. From an econometric point of view, slopes of intertemporal reaction functions are latent variables. The resulting system of equations with time-varying parameters is estimated via the Kalman filter. Different repeated-game oligopoly models correspond to different transition matrices for the latent variables.

We show that with positive interactions in the profit function and costs of price adjustments that are independent across products, staggering is unlikely. Depending on initial conditions, a firm may follow a staggered steady state or a synchronized steady state path.

A central feature of the model is the explicit recognition of the fact that it is impossible for the market as a whole to carry negative inventories, and this introduces an essential non-linearity which carries through into non-linearity of the predicted commodity price series. For most of the thirteen commodity prices, the behaviour of prices from one year to the next conforms to the predictions of the theory about conditional expectations and conditional variances. However, given the non-linearity both of the model and of the actual prices, such conformity is not enough to ensure that the theory yields a complete account of the data.

Monotonicity restrictions are placed on off-the equilibrium-path beliefs to exclude equilibria supported by optimistic conjectures.

A buyer and seller are engaged in the trade of a single object. Both bargainers have private information about their own preferences and are impatient in that delaying agreement is costly. An equilibrium is constructed in which the bargainers signal the strength of their bargaining positions by delaying prior to making an offer. A bargainer expecting large gains from trade is more impatient than one expecting small gains, and hence makes concessions earlier on. Trade occurs whever gains from trade exist, but due to the private information, only after costly delay.

Concerning dynamic programming, we show that, given biconvergence, the true value function exists, it is the unique admissible solution to Bellman's equation, and it may be calculated numerically as the limit of successive approximations.

It is found that IV regressions are consistent even when the instruments are stochastically independent of the regressors. This phenomenon, which contrasts with traditional theory for stationary time series, is a beneficial artifact of spurious regression theory whereby stochastic trends in the instruments ensure their relevance asymptotically. Problems of inference are also addressed and some promising new theoretical results are reported. These involve a class of Wald tests which are modified by semiparametric corrections for serial correlation and for endogeneity. The resulting test statistics which we term fully-modified Wald tests have limiting X2 distributions, thereby removing the obstacles to inference in cointegrated systems that were presented by the nuisance parameter dependencies in earlier work. Some simulation results are reported which seek to explore the sampling behaviour of our suggested procedures. These simulations compare our fully modified (semiparametric) methods with the parametric error-correction methodology that has been extensively used in recent empirical research and with conventional least squares regression. Both the fully-modified and errorcorrection methods work well in finite samples and the sampling performance of each procedure confirms the relevance of asymptotic distribution theory, as distinct from super-consistency results, in discriminating between statistical methods.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a57_3ay_3a1990_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a99-125..htm,10.2307/2297545

Such constraints are illustrated by the economic restrictions of homogeneity and symmetry, and the functional form restrictions of additivity and linearity. The proposed tests are based on estimates of regression coefficients, that statistically characterize the departures from the constraint exhibited by the data. The coefficients are based on weighted-average derivatives, that are reformulated in terms of derivatives of the density of x. Coefficient estimators are proposed that use nonparametric kernel estimators of the density and its derivatives. These statistics are shown to be √N consistent and asymptotically normal, and thus are comparable to estimators based on a (correctly specified) parametric model of g(x).",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a56_3ay_3a1989_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a535-552..htm,10.2307/2297499

The key difference between earlier formulations of search externalities by Diamond, Mortensen, and Spence on the one hand, and our own on the other, is that here spillovers of knowledge depend not only on how hard people are trying, but also on the differences in what they know: if all of us know the same thing, we cannot learn from each other.

This view is in contrast to the results in the literature on full implementation where it is shown that (under certain conditions) games exist which only have efficient equilibria. The games usually used to demonstrate existence are quite complex and seem ""unnatural"" possibly leading to the perception that implementation requires a central authority to choose and impose the game. In a simple public goods setting, we show that a very natural game—similar to one often used elsewhere in the literature to model private provision—in fact fully implements the core of this economy in undominated perfect equilibria. More specifically, we consider a complete information economy with one private good and two possible social decisions. Agents voluntarily contribute any non-negative amount of the private good they choose and the social decision is to provide the public good iff contributions are sufficient to pay for it. The contributions are refunded otherwise. The set of undominated perfect equilibrium outcomes of this game is exactly the core of the economy. We give some extensions of this result, discuss the role of perfection and alternative equilibrium notions, and discuss the intuition and implications of the results.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a56_3ay_3a1989_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a583-601..htm,10.2307/2297502

An examination of information aggregation in a non-competitive rational expectations model using a Nash equilibrium in demand functions shows that the schizophrenia problem is avoided by having each trader take into account the effect his demand has on the equilibrium price. Given a distribution of private information across traders, prices reveal less information than in the competition equilibrium, and prices no longer become fully informative in the limit as noise trading vanishes or as traders become risk neutral. With small traders, the model may become one of monopolistic competition, not perfect competition. In contrast to the competitive model, a reasonable model of endogenous acquisition of costly private information is obtained, even when traders are risk-neutral.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a56_3ay_3a1989_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a317-355..htm,10.2307/2297551

This paper introduces this notion of market size in a model of price competition with imperfect substitutes by constructing a model which creates a bridge between the Chamberlin and Bertrand-Edge worth lines of work on price competition. We investigate the role of two fundamental parameters in the existence of an equilibrium: the market size, given by the number n of competitors, and the degree of substitutability. We prove that: (a) For a given number of n ≦ 2 of competitors, a sufficiently large but finite degree of substitutability entails nonexistence. This thus generalizes the Bertrand-Edgeworth nonexistence result, which applies only to perfect substitutes, (b) Conversely for a given upper bound on the degree of substitutability, a sufficiently large number of competitors ensures existence, which thus introduces a significant role for market size in models of imperfect competition. We finally investigate the proximity of an equilibrium (when it exists) to a ""competitive outcome"", and we find that both high substitutability and large market size are a condition for competitiveness.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a56_3ay_3a1989_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a217-234..htm,10.2307/2297458

We are particularly interested in the effects of R&D spillovers and in calculating the social and private rates of return. There are three effects associated with the intra-industry R&D spillover. First, costs decline as knowledge expands for the externality-receiving firms. Second, production structures are affected, as factor demands change in response to the spillover. Third, the rates of capital accumulation are affected by the R&D spillover. These cost-reducing, factor-biasing and capital adjustment effects are estimated for four industries. The existence of R&D spillovers implies that the social and private rates of return to R&D capital differ. We estimate that the social return exceeds the private return in each industry.

Efficient minimum Chi-squared estimation procedures are described. A two-step algorithm based on a conditional maximum likelihood estimator provides a natural framework for both computing a linearized and locating the joint maximum likelihood estimator. The unimodality of the simultaneous equation tobit likelihood function is proved and this model is used to illustrate the empirical application of some of the estimators considered in the paper.

It considers the example of an incumbent firm which enters a contractual relationship with its workers in order to deter entry. It assumes away the possibility for the parties to precommit not to make Pareto-improving renegotiations of the agreement once entry has taken place. Under symmetric information, the contract is thus found to be useless for entry deterrence. If the incumbent firm or workers possess some private information, excessive post-entry production levels can however be sustained ex post, since output reductions may not be incentive compatible. While information asymmetries are usually welfare-decreasing when the goal is optimal risk sharing, they can thus be welfare-improving for the contracting parties when commitment against outsiders is the goal of the contract. The role of the renegotiation process as a constraint on sustainable agreements is stressed in the paper, and the general relevance of strategic contractual commitment is discussed.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a55_3ay_3a1988_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a377-390..htm,10.2307/2297390

1703,Review of Economic Studies,Money and Contracts,['Roger Farmer'],"1988, vol. 55, issue 3, 431-446",[],Abstract: This paper presents a novel interpretation of the fact that high nominal interest rates accompany low levels of real GNP. It constructs a model in which money and bonds are both held as a result of legal restrictions on the banking system. Open market operations may increase the equilibrium rate of interest and raise the cost of credit. This increase in the cost of credit causes firms to write labour contracts in which layoffs occur more frequently. The nature of optimal labour contracts is derived explicitly from assumptions about the information that is available to firms and to workers.,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a55_3ay_3a1988_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a431-446..htm,10.2307/2297393

At the time of trading they each privately know their value s and cost r respectively, but these are not known when the contract is drawn up. The contract specifies a Bayesian revelation mechanism for implementing a trading rule and prices, as functions of their types s and r. An optimal (second-best) contract balances the goal of efficient trading and risk sharing against the need to provide the agents with incentives to reveal their type truthfully. An optimal contract is characterized. First, it is efficient to have some insurance from a third party: even though neither the buyer nor the seller will be fully insured, there is no need for the buyer to be exposed to the seller's risk or vice versa. Second, there will be less than first-best trade (underproduction). Third, once they have privately learnt their type—but before they have played the mechanism—both the buyer and the seller prefer that the final outcome will be trade rather than no trade. Fourth, although the trade prices increase with s and r, the rest of the contract need not be monotonic. This lack of monotonicity means that the standard methodology fails: it is not enough simply to appeal to local incentive compatibility, since global incentive constraints may bind. A nonstandard technique has to be used to find the nature of the second-best distortions.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a55_3ay_3a1988_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a49-69..htm,10.2307/2297529

We use the variation of tenure over a given job match as the principal instrumental variable for tenure. The variation intenure over the job, in contrast to variation in tenure across individuals and jobs, is uncorrelated by construction with the fixed individual specific and job match specific components of the error term of the wage equation.

The definition is based on the notion of ""favourable composite transfers"" which involve a regressive transfer combined with a simultaneous progressive transfer at a lower income level. The paper proceeds to identify when one distribution can be obtained from another using a sequence of progressive transfers and favourable composite transfers, and hence when all transfer sensitive Pigou-Dalton indices agree on their pairwise inequality ranking. Since agreement occurs in some situations when Pigou-Dalton indices are not unanimous, transfer sensitivity adds power to the ""unambiguous"" inequality judgements based on the Pigou-Dalton condition and, in particular, enables distributions whose Lorenz curves intersect to be conclusively ranked.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a54_3ay_3a1987_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a485-497..htm,10.2307/2297571

Changes in these variables affect both total savings and the amount of savings that is diverted toward investment in capital.

In this case the land-using sector dominates factor markets more than asset markets.

In contrast to the standard assumption of a fixed, given distribution of households, we introduce the possibility of households' relocation in reaction to firms' location decisions. Thus, the spatial distribution of households is treated as endogenous, and a land market is introduced on which households compete for land-use. Households consume simultaneously land and firms' output. Accordingly, the demand of each household becomes in turn endogenous as it depends on the income left after the land rent is paid. Not surprisingly, the results obtained within this more general framework prove to be very different from the standard results. For example, in the 2- and 3-firm cases, the optimal configuration of firms is a Nash equilibrium when transport costs are high enough or the amount of vacant land is large enough. The existence property is restored in the 3-firm case when the transport costs are high enough.

This test extends previous such work with micro data by simultaneously allowing for intertemporal substitution, uncertainty and endogenous unemployment. Using the standard specification of intertemporal labour supply behaviour, I find strong evidence against this interpretation of unemployment. There are two possible interpretations of the test results. The first is that it is necessary to turn to alternative models of the labour market in which unemployed workers are off a supply function. The second is that the test results indicate the necessity of moving to more complex models of intertemporal substitution.

However, in so far as they claim to represent economic behaviour, empirical macro-economic systems are certainly open to direct evaluation and testing against data information. The last few years have witnessed a substantial growth in the literature on econometric evaluation techniques, but despite important improvements in formalising evaluation procedures and their increased scope, formidable problems confront any investigation of a high dimensional, non-linear, stochastic, dynamic structure. Since system characteristics are the prime concern of economy-wide models, it might be the case that the validity of every individual component is not essential to adequate overall performance. While this viewpoint is debatable it does draw attention to the need for system evaluation procedures, at which point data limitations pose serious constraints on formal tests. Thus a new ""limited information"" test of forecast encompassing is proposed, based only on forecasts and requiring no other data from a model's proprietors. The derivation, merits and drawbacks of such a test are presented together with some suggestions for testing entailed relationships and inter-equation feedbacks.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a53_3ay_3a1986_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a671-690..htm,10.2307/2297611

(Hendry (1980)) With that in mind, Monte Carlo studies may be divided operationally into three phases: design, simulation, and post-simulation analysis. This paper provides a guide to the last of those three, post-simulation analysis, given the design and simulation of a Monte Carlo study, and uses Pesaran's (1974) study of statistics for testing non-nested hypotheses to illustrate the techniques described. A statistic is derived for testing for significant deviations between the asymptotic and (observed) finite sample properties. Further, that statistic provides the basis for analysing discrepancies between the finite sample and asymptotic properties using response surfaces. The results for Pesaran's study indicate the value of asymptotic theory in interpreting finite sample properties and certain limitations for doing so. Finally, a method is proposed for adjusting the finite sample sizes of different test statistics so that comparisons of their power may be made.

When current employers are better informed about the abilities of their workers than potential alternative employers, they will presumably concentrate their efforts to prevent turnover on their better workers. If these efforts lead to fewer quits among better workers, the stream of job changers should be composed disproportionately of less able ones. This will inhibit turnover in two ways. First, firms should be unwilling to hire from the job-changing pool except at low wages. Second, workers who change jobs are marked by being part of an inferior group, which lowers their future bargaining power and wages. Models of these phenomena can be made to account for many aspects of observed labour market behaviour.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a53_3ay_3a1986_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a325-347..htm,10.2307/2297632

I also analyse the firms' decisions to form a trade association to share their cost data. Under conditions of linear demand and Cournot behaviour, industrywide information exchange is the unique point in the core of the trade association membership game. The exchange of cost data increases expected profits and welfare, but reduces expected consumer surplus. Cost sharing increases efficiency by raising the market shares of lower cost firms and reducing the variability of aggregate output. Consumer surplus is diminished, however, because the variance of output is reduced, and consumer surplus is a convex function of output.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a53_3ay_3a1986_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a433-446..htm,10.2307/2297638

In the sequel to this paper, authors have explained the utility function in the economic games referred to earlier are neither continuous nor quasi-concave. However, they demonstrate that the payoff functions in mildly modified versions of these constructs exhibit two weaker forms of continuity which, together with the requirement of quasi-concavity, suffice for the existence of an equilibrium.

Suppose the planner of a piece of forest land obtains utility in any time period from the timber content of trees harvested in that period. If the planner wishes to maximize the discounted sum of such utilities starting from any initial forest, what pattern of planting and harvesting trees should it follow? This paper provides a systematic analysis to answer the above question. In particular, the optimal solution is related to the Faustmann periodic solution and the sustained yield solution, which are prominent in the forestry literature.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a52_3ay_3a1985_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a263-282..htm,10.2307/2297621

However, with more general demand shocks (and still ignoring stock-outs), the excess of MC over EMR has the same sign as the covariance of the slope of the demand curve and the marginal valuation of inventory. The equality of EMR and MC is also broken by taking account of stock-outs, even if demand shocks are additive. If there is a production lag, then taking account of stock-outs implies that optimal behaviour will be characterized by production smoothing even if the cost of production is linear. Two alternative definitions of production smoothing are presented and optimal behaviour in the presence of stock-outs displays each type of smoothing.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a52_3ay_3a1985_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a283-293..htm,10.2307/2297622

In this research optimal output Y* is defined as the minimum point on the firm's short-run average total cost curve, and capacity utilization is then computed as CU = Y / Y*, where Y is actual output. Here I extend these concepts to include adjustment costs due to changes in the stock of capital, and nonstatic expectations of future output demand and input prices. The more general notion of CU is shown to depend on the shadow values of the firm's quasi-fixed inputs, and is decomposed to isolate the effects of anticipatory expectations. An empirical comparison is then made between traditional indices and alternative economic CU measures, using annual U.S. manufacturing data 1954–1980. The calculated indices exhibit plausible patterns, which can be interpreted as the effects of nonstatic expectations and adjustment costs.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a52_3ay_3a1985_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a295-309..htm,10.2307/2297623

Similarly, international differences in the willingness to work during abnormal hours generate a wider variety of trade patterns than are possible in the standard specific-factors model.

Will a second-best contract have underemployment inefficiency, or overemployment? And, with a stochastic contract, are those workers randomly selected for layoff worse off than their retained colleagues (involuntary layoff), or vice versa (involuntary retention)? The answers depend on the nature of the workers' preferences. Two polar cases are looked at, corresponding to permanent and temporary layoff. The former is characterized by overemployment and involuntary retention; the latter by underemployment and involuntary layoff. Also examined are ""simple contracts"" where all retained workers are paid a common wage and all laid-off workers receive a common redundancy payment.

In the symmetric equilibrium, different firms produce at different output levels because they have different information. Because the information individual firms have is random, total output and hence market price is also random for any finite number of firms. The main result of the paper relates to the asymptotic properties of the equilibrium, when the number of firms becomes large. Under fairly general conditions on the joint distribution of demand and individual firms' information about demand, the random equilibrium price converges almost surely to a constant in the limit. More importantly, this price equals the perfectly competitive price. In other words, in large markets, even if no firm knows the true market demand curve and firms are not price-takers and do not use price as a signal to improve their information, the competitive price will prevail with certainty.

Consider the space ~ of distribution functions on [c, r] (i.e. the set of non-negative non-decreasing, Lebesgue-measureable functions F such that F(r) = I). This space is a convex compact subspace ofa Banach space. Hence Schauder's Theorem (Simmons (1963), p. 338) implies any continuous map on this space has a fixed point. The map which takes any distribution function F into the function 'I' defined (equation (13)) on page 450 of the original paper is such a mapping (the superscripts there should now be ignored). As should be clear from the discussion there of the properties of '1', the fixed point of this mapping is an equilibrium.

This taxonomic approach serves to identify the welfare implications of exogenous and endogenous contractual rigidities, and to isolate a class of externalities that is unique to economies with asymmetric information.

We derive a promotional equilibrium based on a specific information transmission technology, paying explicit attention to the structure of consumer information and its impact on firms' demand curves.

Durability is chosen to minimize the cost of providing a given present value of flow of services over the life of the durable. As pointed out by Swan, under constant returns to scale, the cost-minimizing durability is independent of the level of output; thus competitive firms will choose the same durability as a monopolist, even though they would produce different levels of output. In this paper, we relax the assumption of constant returns to scale and derive more general conditions under which optimal durability is independent of the level of output. We also demonstrate that with a particular specification of external diseconomies of scale, the monopolist will produce goods with greater durability than would be produced by competitive firms.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a50_3ay_3a1983_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a625-637..htm,10.2307/2297765

The analysis focuses on a market for a product that can be produced at different quality levels. All consumers prefer higher to lower quality, but they may differ in their willingness to pay for quality. Producers can produce any quality they like, but higher qualities are more costly to produce. The information in this market is imperfect in the sense that the exact quality chosen by a firm is known only to the firm itself; some information about the quality of a firm's product will, however, reach its potential customers, even if they do not make any special effort to acquire it. Within the framework suggested here, two conclusions are drawn. First, prices may serve as signals which exactly differentiate the available quality levels. That is, there exists a fulfilledexpectations equilibrium at which each price signals a unique quality level. Second, the pricesignals are not arbitrary. Each price-signal exceeds the marginal cost of producing the quality it signals. Such a mark-up depends on the nature of the product-specific information received by consumers—the poorer the information, the higher the mark-up.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a50_3ay_3a1983_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a647-658..htm,10.2307/2297767

Given a two-period world, the monopolist enters initially and enjoys an uncontested monopoly for one period, while the entrant may enter and compete during the second period. Demand is random one period earlier and independently distributed in both periods and entry corresponds to an irreversible capacity choice, made under certain demand. All other production decisions take place after demand has been revealed. Risk-neutrality is assumed on both sides. If entry occurs then there is a Cournot duopoly in the second period. It is shown that concurrently with this Cournot production game, there is a separate Stackelberg-type game with capacities as decision variables. Entry-deterrence conditions are derived under general demand and cost assumptions.

This class of processes includes Two-State Markov Chains and Renewal Processes as special cases. It is shown that the optimal pricing policy of a monopolistic firm with non-convex costs of price adjustment is (S, s) in its real-price, i.e. its nominal price relative to the price level. A basic certainty-equivalence result is proved: i.e. the firm behaves as if it faces a certain and fixed rate of inflation, higher than the actual expected rate, the difference between the two rates being a risk premium which depends on the real interest rate and the parameters of the stochastic process. One can thus apply previous results from the case of certainty (Sheshinski and Weiss, The Review of Economic Studies, 1977) to obtain comparative static results. In particular, one finds that an increase in the variance of expected inflation leads firms to choose a pricing policy with larger amplitude in real price.

Browning'],"1983, vol. 50, issue 2, 375-381",[],Abstract: There are many situations where agents supply input factors and produce a transferable good (money). This paper examines the conditions on technology under which agents can specify reward schedules which lead to an efficient outcome even if inputs are chosen non-cooperatively and preferences are private information. The characterisation of the class of technologies that allows this involves a generalization of additivity known as (n − 1)-additivity.,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a50_3ay_3a1983_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a375-381..htm,10.2307/2297423

It is easy to modify this procedure for the case where final products are not homegeneous, but the presence of intermediate production raises considerable difficulties. They stem from the requirement that firms be asked about the effect of specific reallocations of inputs; because Heal type processes require that the aggregate production plan be feasible at each step of the procedure, these reallocations must be consistent with each other. In the presence of intermediate goods, this consistency is difficult to maintain as the answer of one firm will dictate the feasible changes in inputs for other firms. It should be possible to solve this problem for some special cases; I have not been able to do so in other cases without changing the procedure fundamentally. In our version of Heal's procedure, the planning board asks each firm to provide a local description of its production possibility set, and does not commit itself to transfers of certain size. The important difference here is between the examination of certain specific reallocations, and the study of local approximations to the economy. The questions that the centre asks of firms are composed of two parts, a prospective production plan and a real number which indicates the maximal size of the reallocation which the planning board has in mind. The answers of the firms are also composed of two parts, the first corresponds to the vector of marginal rates of transformation in the continuous version of the procedure, the second, a real number, is a measure of the distance between the proposal of the centre and the boundary of the production possibility set. Hence, the sizes of the messages which are transmitted are minimally larger than in the continuous version of the procedure. Even in the framework where both are applicable, the procedure of this paper has two advantages over that of Henry and Zylberberg. First, the message space is smaller.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a50_3ay_3a1983_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a383-391..htm,10.2307/2297424

Price smoothing may be manifested in two forms. First, price changes may be moderated with respect to those implied by the demand function; and second, the firm may choose to restrict price fluctuations by establishing upper and/or lower bounds on prices. We show that the extent of the asymmetry in price smoothing depends on the relationship between the inventory holding cost and the backlog penalty cost.

If a non-manipulable choice function satisfies a weak unanmity-respecting condition (which is equivalent to having an unrestricted range) then it will depend only on voters' ideal points. Further, such a choice function will decompose into a product of one-dimensional mechanisms in the sense that each coordinate of the chosen point depends only on the respective coordinate of the voters' ideal points. Each coordinate function will also be non-manipulable and respect unanimity. Such one-dimensional mechanisms are uncompromising in the sense that voters cannot take an extreme position to influence the choice to their advantage. Two characterizations of uncompromising choice functions are presented. One is in terms of a continuity condition, the other in terms of ""phantom voters"" i.e. those points which are chosen which are not any voter's ideal point. There are many such mechanisms which are not dictatorial. However, if differentiability is required of the choice function, this forces it to be either constant or dictatorial.

To investigate this mechanism, conventional wage and price equations are estimated for 19 countries and then used for simulation. Stagflation has been caused in roughly equal amounts by rising relative import prices and by the fall in the rate of productivity growth. In the basic model the Phillips curve is assumed not to adapt to falls in feasible real wage growth, but in a final section an adaptive wage equation is estimated, which confirms that the process of adaptation is slow.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a49_3ay_3a1982_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a707-730..htm,10.2307/2297186

The structures considered are a planned economy, pure monopoly, and competition with patent rights. In an efficient allocation the date of invention coincides with the date of innovation (the date at which technology is used). This is also true with a pure monopoly, but monopoly retards technical progress relative to the efficient level. Competition for patents rights to a new technology results in excessively rapid technical progress if the resource endowment of the economy is sufficiently large. Also, competition may lead to ""sleeping patents"" where invention strictly precedes the date of innovation.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a49_3ay_3a1982_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a567-582..htm,10.2307/2297287

It is shown that equilibrium contracts provide for wages which never decline with age and increase only when the worker's market value increases above his current wage. In addition to characterizing the equilibrium wage contract, we also derive some of its implications for the behaviour of aggregate wages across various groups of workers. These implications explain some findings in the recent empirical literature on age-earnings profiles. In particular our model can explain why earnings may be positively related to experience even after controlling for productivity, as some empirical studies have indicated.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a49_3ay_3a1982_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a315-333..htm,10.2307/2297359

Hausman's specification test is then used to determine whether ignoring constrained workers has led to biases in traditional labour supply estimates, and the empirical results suggest that previous estimates of several important parameters are biased.

2005,Review of Economic Studies,Information and Incentives: The Agency Information Problem,['Frøystein Gjesdal'],"1982, vol. 49, issue 3, 373-390",[],"Abstract: This paper considers the use of imperfect information for risk sharing and incentive purposes when perfect observation of actions and outcomes is impossible, making complete contracting infeasible. The incentive-insurance problem is defined to consist of two parts: the choice of an information system and the design of a sharing rule based on the information system. A generalized agency model is formulated to analyse this problem. The agency models of Ross (1973a, b), Wilson (1968), Stiglitz (1974), Mirrlees (1976), Harris and Raviv (1979), Holmström (1979) a.o. appear as special cases of the generalized model. The analysis focuses on the value of information in the agency information problem. The set of information systems which are valuable—i.e. improve risk sharing and incentives in a Pareto sense—is characterized. A problem-independent ranking of information systems for the agency information problem is then characterized under the assumption that the agent's preferences are additive in money and actions. The ranking may be viewed as a generalization of Blackwell's ranking of information systems for decision problems, to this particular game. When the agent's risk preferences depend on his choice of action, on the other hand, it is shown that the Blackwell ranking may be invalid. Randomized incentive schemes are shown to be efficient when the incentive effect of risk is positive and sufficiently large relative to the absolute risk aversion of the partners.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a49_3ay_3a1982_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a373-390..htm,10.2307/2297362

A social choice function is defined to be minimally democratic if and only if whenever there exists an alternative which is ranked first by n − 1 voters and is no lower than second for the last voter, then the social choice must be uniquely that alternative. No constraints are placed on the social choice function for other preference profiles. Using the classical definitions of equilibria for n-person games—namely Nash and strong equilibria, it is shown here that over unrestricted preference domains, as long as there are at least as many alternatives as individuals, no minimally democratic social choice function is implementable. A similar result holds in certain restricted domains of the type assumed by economists over public goods spaces.

However, the joint model also has implications that, while compatible with stylized facts about the life cycle, are sharper than those of either kind of pure model.

2026,Review of Economic Studies,Monopolistic Competition in a Large Economy with Differentiated Commodities: A Correction,['Oliver D. Hart'],"1982, vol. 49, issue 2, 313-314",[],"Abstract: In Hart (1979), a model of monopolistic competition in a large economy with differentiated commodities was developed. In this model, firms had a choice whether to set up or not. One feature of the model was that free entry of firms was not assumed. Barriers to entry were captured by assuming that there was a large (generally, infinite) set of potential firms F. Corresponding to each f ∊ F, there was a firm (called ""firm f"") with a production set Y(f). Each firm had a set-up cost associated with it. Only very weak conditions were placed on the set F and the production set mapping Y(·), so that in particular the case where different firms could produce a commodity on different terms was allowed for. The economy was made large by replicating the consumer sector, keeping the production sector, i.e. the set of potential firms F, fixed. The number of operating firms in equilibrium generally increased, however, since in view of the set-up costs there was ""room"" for more firms in a large economy. Unfortunately, it turns out that this procedure, while correct, does not capture quite what was intended. In particular, while in the resulting monopolistically competitive equlibrium, some firms will earn supernormal profits, it can be shown that, for any η > 0, the per capita number of firms earning profits in excess of η tends to zero as the size of the consumer sector tends to infinity (see Corollary 6 in the Appendix to Hart (1979)). In other words, in per capita terms, almost all firms earn approximately zero profits in a large economy. Thus while barriers to entry may be significant in absolute terms, in per capita terms they are negligible. The way round this difficulty is to drop the assumption that the set of potential firms is fixed. Instead substitute the assumption that the set of potential firms in the economy rE, where the consumer sector is replicated r times, is given bywhere F is as before. That is, one replicates the set of potential firms at the same time as the consumer sector. Then the theorems of Hart (1979) continue to hold. Corollary 6 in the Appendix must be modified as follows. Corollary 6′. There exists h > 0 such thatfor all f ∊ F. Corollary 6′ is proved below. Otherwise the proofs of Theorem 1 and Proposition 2 are unchanged (one no longer sets h = 1 after Corollary 6). As an example, F might consist of one firm with an efficient technology for producing some commodity and one firm with an inefficient technology. Then in the economy rE, there will be r potential firms with the efficient technology and r potential firms with the inefficient technology. It is easy to construct cases where both types of firms operate in the monopolistically competitive equilibrium in rE and the efficient firms earn supernormal profits which are bounded away from zero as r → ∞. Thus barriers to entry which are significant in per capita terms are now allowed for. A justification for replicating F along with the consumer sector can be given. In the above example, the efficient firms may owe their superior technology to the fact that they are situated on good land, say, of which there is a scarcity (thus the supernormal profits are just rents on the land). When one replicates the economy, it is natural to replicate the scarce land and hence the number of firms which are situated on it, so as to keep everything constant except for scale. Note finally that it may be possible to generalize the analysis to the case where the set of potential firms in the economy rE is given by rF, where 1F, 2F are exogenously specified sets and rF is not necessarily the r-fold union of some set F. We have not investigated this, however. Proof of Corollary 6′. Suppose not. Then for each h > 0, we can find f ∊ F with . By Lemma 5 (2), rπf > h for all r ≧ some r*. But in rE there are r firms identical to firm f and so each of these firms makes profit in excess of h in the monopolistically competitive equilibrium when r ≧ r*. Hence total per capita profits of all firms exceed h in equilibrium when r ≧ r*. It follows that, letting h → ∞, we can find a subsequence of the economies rE such that total per capita profits tend to infinity along the subsequence. However, applying Corollary 4 and an argument similar to that in (A.30)–(A.32), we see that ʃArp(a)drY1(a) is bounded. Hence so are per capita profits, ʃArp(a)drY1(a) + rY0.

2029,Review of Economic Studies,Perfect Competition and the Core,['Andreu Mas-Colell'],"1982, vol. 49, issue 1, 15-30",[],"It is part of the conventional wisdom of economics that a mass market, i.e. one with many relatively small participants, will tend to be perfectly competitive. One possible meaning of this is that it will behave as if prices were quoted and taken as given by the traders. The final allocation of goods and services is then called Walrasian. There are at least two classical formal theories of perfect competition. They can be associated with the names of Cournot (1838) and Edgeworth (1881). Edgeworth's contribution has led to the modern theory of the Core of a market (see Debreu-Scarf (1963), Aumann (1964), and Hildenbrand (1974) and his references). Its central result, the Core Equivalence Theorem, states conditions under which, in a mass economy, competition in the sense of Edgeworth yields at equilibrium Walrasian allocations. The extension to general equilibrium analysis of Cournot's partial equilibrium model is currently being actively pursued (Gabzewicz-Vial (1972), Hart (1979), (1980), Shubik (1973), Novshek-Sonnenschein (1978). See also the April 1980 symposium issue of the Journal of Economic Theory). By now, a variety of Cournot Equivalence Theorems is available. There is substantial (but not complete) overlap between the set of conditions identified as important by the Edgeworth and the Cournot type analysis. By and large, both approaches have proved to be useful tools for testing the competitiveness of some theoretical market situations. For example, differentiated commodities models have been analyzed in Mas-Colell (1975) from the point of view of the Core and in Hart (1979) from the Cournot perspective. For yet another approach with a classical foundation to the theory of perfect competition, see J. Ostroy (1980). It is probably fair to say that the economics profession at large thinks of perfect competition more in Cournot's than in Edgeworth's terms. The purpose of this paper is to make the case for the Core in the light of some of the issues raised by the recent Cournot analysis. We will try to argue that the Edgeworth notion of competition yields a quite sensible concept and a very flexible tool and that, not surprisingly, Edgeworth and Cournot competition are close relatives once properly viewed. By way of motivation, it will be useful to begin by examining and commenting on four points of real or apparent contrast between the two approaches:",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a49_3ay_3a1982_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a15-30..htm,10.2307/2297137

In a world not subject to random shocks, consumers and producers when faced with competitive prices need look no further than their own preferences or production technology to be able to make a decision. They need give no thought to the tastes, endowments or technology of other agents. However, in a world subject to random shocks, this is no longer the case. Agents are faced with the problem of forecasting future states of nature and more importantly of forecasting the impact of these states on the actions of other agents. Rational expectations theories provide a model of how agents make those forecasts. In a world subject to random shocks, it will be the case that agents acquire (or at least attempt to acquire) information about the future realization of the shocks. It will, in general, be the case that different agents have access to different information. The fact that information is dispersed throughout the economy has the potential to cause a misallocation of resources relative to what would be the case if all agents knew everything. An efficient allocation of resources will in general require the transfer of information from consumers who have some information about their future demands to producers who can take current actions to mitigate avoidable scarcities or surpluses. Though many classical and neo-classical writers emphasize the informational role of prices, the standard Marshallian or Walrasian model of competitive equilibrium does not involve prices transferring information across traders. The purpose of this paper is to show that rational expectations models are radically different from Walrasian models in an economy where traders have diverse information. This is demonstrated by showing that unlike what occurs in a Walrasian equilibrium of an economy with heterogeneous information, if there is a complete set of insurance markets and utility is additively separable over time, then there exists a rational expectations equilibrium which gives consumers the same allocation as if each consumer has access to all of the economy's information. This implies that, under the above assumptions, a central planner with all the economy's information could not Pareto dominate the competitive allocation achieved when traders have diverse information and rational expectations. This paper makes no attempt to survey the literature on rational expectations. The reader is referred to Shiller (1978), Barro (1981) for a survey of macroeconomics and rational expectations, and Radner (1980) for a survey of the microeconomics and mathematical theory of rational expectations. This paper will, however, try to outline the evolution of the rational expectations concept from a notion of optimal forecasting to a virtually complete departure from the Walrasian model of equilibrium. The rest of this section is devoted to a discussion of pre-rational expectations ideas.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a541-559..htm,10.2307/2297195

We have several reasons for feeling that such a re-examination is timely. First, most previous studies have considered the distribution among all employees, while theoretical considerations suggest that disaggregated data might be more appropriate. We elaborate this point in Section 1 of the paper. Second, the method of estimating the parameters of the Pareto and lognormal functions has not always been given the attention it deserves. In Section 2 we address this issue, and also refer briefly to the related one of goodness of fit. The remainder of the paper presents parameter estimates for the Pareto and lognormal functions, using first aggregate data (Section 3), and then distributions within occupational groups (Section 4).

2048,Review of Economic Studies,On the Existence of an Optimal Income Tax Schedule,['Mamoru Kaneko'],"1981, vol. 48, issue 4, 633-642",[],"Since the pioneering work of Mirrlees (1971), many authors have considered the non-linear optimal taxation problem in models with two kinds of goods-labour and consumptionin terms of the variational method or the Pontryagin maximum principle. That is, several necessary conditions have been derived and investigated assuming the existence of an optimal tax schedule. These works, however, have been done without any verification of the existence of an optimal tax schedule. This problem is not a simple maximization problem but a compound maximization problem, i.e. it has individuals' utility maximization and government's social welfare maximization depending upon each other. So, the existence of an optimal tax schedule is not clear either mathematically or economically. On the other hand, Kaneko (1979) proved the existence of an optimal tax schedule for the class of progressive (convex) ones, which is narrower than that employed in the preceeding works. Although the progressiveness of tax schedules is an important condition to consider in an optimal taxation problem, it should be checked whether or not this condition can be derived in a more general theory which permits non-progressive tax schedules.' Thus we have two general problems-one is the existence of an optimal tax schedule in a class which permits non-progressive (non-convex) tax schedules and the other one is the progressiveness (in some sense) of the optimal tax schedules. Here we consider only the existence problem. In this paper, we model the optimal taxation problem in the context of general equilibrium analysis. We consider an economy with a finite number of individuals, a finite number of firms and a government, where a finite number of consumption goods and one public good are produced by the firms and the government respectively using labour as input. An optimal tax schedule means one which gives a competitive equilibrium with the maximum value of a social welfare function. Thus the model of this paper is much wider than those of the preceding works, though this paper concerns only the existence of an optimal tax schedule in an economy with a finite number of individuals. The existence problem in an economy with a continuum of individuals is important for the further consideration of the shape of an optimal tax schedule, because tax rates or disposable incomes of rich individuals can be considered naturally in such a model.2 The technique given in this paper, however, can not be applied to the existence problem in such a case. This author continues to investigate the continuum case.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a633-642..htm,10.2307/2297202

Work by Kaldor (1940) and Goodwin (1951), as well as Hicks (1950) (and more recently Ichimura (1954), Klein and Preston (1969), Change and Smyth (1971), Torre (1977) and Varian (1979)) attempted to model the persistence of fluctuations (or what was then believed to be an ""endogenous cycle"") with systematic economic behaviour by employing nonlinear behavioural functions. The nonlinear dynamic approach to modelling cycles has used either a variant of the Poincare-Bendixon theorem, to prove the existence of closed orbits, or a theorem on Leinard's equation (a second order non-linear differential equation) to prove the existence, uniqueness and stability of limit cycles. This paper shows that the output dynamic of a modified version of a traditional, dynamic IS-LM macro-model is reducible to Leinard's equation. The models considered here are modifications of a traditional IS-LM model in two important ways. First, we augment the model with a government budget constraint allowing for money and bond financing; and secondly and more importantly, we model investment behaviour as a Kaldor-type nonlinear function of output. It is shown that for cases in which the general equilibrium of the model is locally unstable, the model is nevertheless globally stable in the sense that all locally unstable points converge to a unique and stable limit cycle. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 sets up the general model, and discusses its geometric properties. Section 3 derives Leinard's equation and proves the existence, uniqueness and stability of a limit cycle for various substructures of the model. Section 4 draws some implications. The Appendix states a theorem on Leinard's equation used in the text.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a649-656..htm,10.2307/2297204

In particular, consider an industry composed of two firms, each using the current best-practice technology. The firms are assumed to be operating at Nash equilibrium output levels, generating a market price (given demand) and profit allocations. When a cost-reducing innovation is announced, each firm must determine when (if ever) to adopt it, based in part upon the discounted cost of implementing the new technology, and in part upon the behavior of the rival firm. If either firm adopts before the other, it can expect to make substantial profits at the expense of the other firm. On the other hand, the discounted sum of purchase price and adjustment costs may decline with the lengthening of the adjustment period as various quasi-fixed factors become more easily variable. Therefore, although waiting costs the firm more in terms of foregone profits, it may save money on the cost of purchasing the new technology.

Proposals to raise the level of business investment have included overall tax cuts, tax incentives to spur investment and a reduction in the level of government spending. This paper presents a theoretical apparatus to explore the relationships between fiscal policy, government debt, inflation and capital accumulation. It develops a one-sector growth model embodying a stochastic production function and government fiscal policy. Atomistic agents in the economy choose consumption levels and allocate their wealth between risky capital and risky government debt to maximize expected discounted utility over an infinite horizon. Fiscal policy, by affecting asset yields, affects the composition of portfolios, the price of government bonds and the accumulation of capital. The model is used to answer three general questions: (1) Does the level of government expenditure affect the rate of capital accumulation and inflation in steady state? (2) Does the mode of government finance, when the choice is between an income tax and deficit finance, affect these magnitudes? (3) What is the effect of uncertainty in the productivity of capital on growth? The analysis relates to several areas of literature: (1) the analysis of the relationship between capital accumulation and debt, (2) the theory of the demand for government debt, (3) considerations of the effect of income taxation on risk bearing, and (4) the analysis of capital accumulation under uncertainty. 1. The effects on output and the capital stock of the government's expenditure decision and its decision to finance its expenditure by taxation or debt issue are explored in two major bodies of economic theory. The literature on the ""burden of the debt"" as developed by Modigliani (1961), Diamond (1965), and Phelps and Shell (1969), for example, implies that policies which increase the value of outstanding government debt will tend to lower the level of the capital stock by displacing capital with public debt in private wealth. The theory of money and growth as represented by Tobin (1965) and Sidrauski (1967b) also implies that government debt displaces capital, but specifically recognizes the role of capital gains on government debt.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a435-445..htm,10.2307/2297156

There have, however, been conflicting views on the matter. One argument has been that the attainment of distributional ends should be the responsibility of tax policy and should not be allowed to interfere with the assessment of government projects. Hylland and Zeckhauser (1979) have recently given a valuable contribution to the theoretical clarification of this issue. They showed that under certain assumptions (in their own words): distributional objectives should affect taxes but not programme choice or design. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the same question within a more general economic setting and using a different analytical approach. The more precise purpose is to establish conditions under which the conventional cost-benefit criterion (that sums up unweighted net benefits and neglects tax distortions1) or a simple modification of it is valid in the presence of distributional objectives and second best taxation. Hylland and Zeckhauser showed that certain assumptions are sufficient to permit the use of the conventional cost-benefit criterion in the presence of optimal income taxation. This paper derives conditions which are necessary and sufficient for this criterion to be valid under the same tax system. In general it extends the analysis to the case of mixed income and commodity taxation. It also tries to give more attention to the economic content of the formal results. It should be made clear that the project considered in this analysis is of the public good type. A related strand of analysis is concerned with the social evaluation of publicly provided goods which are sold in the market at tax-distorted prices or market goods used in the public sector. The literature started by Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) has established that when optimal commodity taxes are in operation, private sector producer prices are appropriate public sector shadow prices for such goods even when distribution matters. This is an important result which could do a lot to simplify cost-benefit analyses in the public sector. The Diamond and Mirrlees paper also presented an optimality rule for the provision of public consumption in the presence of taxation (Diamond and Mirrlees, 1971, Section IX). But no attempt was made to derive conditions which would allow the use of simple cost-benefit criteria in this case. So this is the problem to which we address ourselves. We shall return to the relationship between the evaluation of public goods and that of market goods at the end of the paper.

Pollak gave conditions for the representability of long-run choice when the equations of preference dependence are linear and utility additive. Hammond, in a generalization of these findings, provides conditions for stable, representable long run choice when preferences are acyclic, a condition which in essence assures convergence to a long-run choice.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a459-471..htm,10.2307/2297158

This procedure, which has come to be called the MDP procedure, has several desirable properties given correct revelation of each participant's preference. If each individual truthfully announces his marginal rates of substitution between public goods and a private good, every trajectory of the process lies entirely in the space of feasible allocations and monotonically converges to an individually rational Pareto optimum. Moreover, as is shown in Champsaur (1976), given correct revelation, this procedure is neutral to any kind of distributional value judgements in the sense that every individually rational Pareto optimum can be attained as a limit of some trajectory defined by the process. In connection with the problem of whether the participants in the MDP procedure reveal their correct preferences, little literature has so far been written. There are now results available which have been derived by Dreze and de la Vallee Poussin (1971) and Roberts (1979) that (i) at every iterative stage telling the truth is a maximin strategy for each individual and, at an equilibrium of the process, is a Nash equilibrium strategy, and that (ii) correct revelation produces a dominant strategy equilibrium at every instant if a society consists of just two individuals. Nevertheless, maximin strategies are played only because of the rather restricted assumption on each participant's behaviour, while confinement to the case of a two-person society is too severe to give meaningful implications for reality. In either case, one might be fully justified in believing that truthful revelation will hardly appear in the MDP procedure. Fortunately, almost all the properties of the MDP procedure can be preserved under circumstances where the agents misrepresent their marginal rates of substitution; Henry (1979) and Roberts (1979) have shown that, as long as each individual chooses a Nash-type strategy at each instant, the process maintains the same properties as in the case of correct revelation, except that the adjustment speeds of public goods are significantly reduced. This result implies the MDP procedure is implementable under game theoretic circumstances, but at the same time, it exposes serious problems in several respects. In the first place, since the Nash equilibrium strategy of each agent is not necessarily the truthful announcement, the virtue of ""honesty"" is no longer of positive significance in the MDP procedure. Secondly, for the validity of its solution concept, if each agent plays a Nash equilibrium strategy at all, he must have complete knowledge relating to the possible strategies chosen by all the other agents.

2066,Review of Economic Studies,Testing Linear and Log-Linear Regressions for Functional Form,"['Leslie Godfrey', 'M. R. Wickens']","1981, vol. 48, issue 3, 487-496",[],"It is often a problem to know what functional form to choose when specifying an econometric model since economic theory does not usually provide a very precise guide. The choice of functional form may, however, have important implications for subsequent statistical tests, for forecasts and for policy analysis, e.g. see Hall (1978)and Mizon (1977). Due to their simplicity, the specifications most commonly used are the linear and log-linear models. Sometimes the estimates of these two variants are compared with a view to choosing one of them as the ""correct"" representation. Although this comparison may be of interest in certain cases, in others it may be more appropriate to test linearity or log-linearity against a more general functional form rather than against each other. In this paper, we discuss two approaches to testing the adequacy of the linear and log-linear specifications against the more general alternative of the extended Box-Cox (1964) regression model considered by Savin and White (1978). The first of these procedures is based on the Lagrange multiplier approach discussed by Breusch and Pagan (1980) and by Godfrey and Wickens (1980), while the second is derived from work by Andrews (1971) on the selection of data transformations.1 Both approaches lead to tests which are easy to compute and which can reject both models as well as being capable of selecting one form rather than the other. The paper is set out as follows. In Section 2 we compare some existing procedures for testing the functional form of linear and log-linear models. In Section 3 we derive new large sample tests which are based on the Lagrange multiplier approach. The possibility of using small sample tests is discussed in Section 4 and a numerical example to illustrate the use of our new tests is given in Section 5.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a487-496..htm,10.2307/2297160

Lee']","1981, vol. 48, issue 3, 497-505",[],"To explain the kind of problem that this paper deals with it seems easiest to begin with an illustration. Consider a lending institution that approves applications for new home loans which are subsequently either cancelled or drawn. Suppose that typically a loan is not fully drawn immediately on approval; rather the sequence of payments is distributed over time and takes the form of periodic progress payments to builders. Further suppose that the time unit we are dealing with is a month. Then the total loan drawings in any one month would be a function of current and past approvals net of cancellations, i.e. a standard distributed lag model. Now, however, consider the additional complication that the dependence between the current loan drawings and any previous month's approvals is not fixed but varies in a systematic way with the month (or season) we are dealing with. In other words we wish to allow the distributed lag weights themselves to vary seasonally. Such seasonal variation in the distributed lag weights may be induced by the seasonal pattern of work and completion of building including the incidence of public holidays, or by random fluctuations in weather patterns which in turn affect building activity, or by seasonal variation in the ""technology"" of payments. Other reasons could also be thought of. It is emphasised that we are considering not just a seasonal intercept shift but also changes in the lag weights themselves. This paper considers a variety of specifications of such a model and tackles the estimation problem from a Bayesian viewpoint. But first we shall develop a suitable notation and framework for analysing this problem. This will highlight the bi-dimensional nature of the estimation problem. We shall then corsider several alternative representations of prior information regarding the lag coefficients in either the lag or the seasonal dimension. In particular we shall argue that exchangeable priors and smoothness priors which have been previously developed in other contexts are useful notions for representing prior information. Moreover it will be argued that such Bayesian priors can be usefully combined and not simply used separately. It is the emphasis on and systematic exploitation of the bi-dimensional nature of the specification and estimation within a Bayesian framework that constitutes the main novel feature of the paper. The main body of the paper, Section 2, shows how the results of previous work of Lindley and Smith (1972) on Bayesian estimation of a linear model can be adapted and extended in such a way as to yield a family of shrinkage estimators for the seasonally varying distributed lag model. Note however thatLindley and Smith are essentially dealing with a ""one-dimensional"" problem and we wish to deal with a model in which there are two. It would be necessary therefore to adapt their ideas to our situation. The analysis of Section 2 is based on the assumption of known prior variances.

Donaldson']","1981, vol. 48, issue 3, 507-510",[],"In a recent paper, Merton (1975) seeks to extend the theory of growth under uncertainty beyond the customary concern of demonstrating the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the asymptotic stationary distributions of consumption, output, and capital stock. His goal is to derive additional properties of these asymptotic distributions and, in particular, to investigate the ""biases (in an expected value sense) induced by assuming a certainty model when, in fact, outcomes are uncertain"" (Merton (1975, p. 375)). For his (only) source of uncertainty, Merton (1975) models the size of the aggregate labour force as a diffusion process. By further assuming the aggregate savings policy to be linear homogeneous in output, and specifying per worker output as being Cobb-Douglas in capital per worker, Merton (1975) is able to derive closed form expressions for the associated stationary distributions of per worker consumption, output, and capital stock. By comparing the expected values of these distributions with the corresponding steadystate values obtained by applying the identical savings rule to the same model specification, though in the absence of uncertainty, he demonstrates biases in the certainty estimates of the corresponding ""uncertainty"" expected values. Specifically, in his model, expected per worker consumption, output, and capital stock under uncertainty strictly exceed their respective certainty levels. Merton (1975, p. 383) is therefore led to conclude that ""care must be taken in using the certainty analysis even as a first moment approximation theory"". This note is an attempt to replicate Merton's (1975) results in an alternative discrete time version of the one-sector model of optimal stochastic growth. It suggests that diffusion process models have no monopoly, or even apparent advantages, in pursuing characterizations of the asymptotic distributions. Our work confirms the assertion that certainty estimates may be biased approximations of analogous uncertainty values, although our biases are exactly opposite in sign to those of Merton's (1975) model. In our model, the linear homogeneous savings function, which results from optimizing behaviour under uncertainty (rather than being imposed as in Merton (1975)), is the same as that arising in the certainty specification. Thus while our results illustrate Mirrlees' (1974, p. 48) contention that the ""introduction of uncertainty may not, at the aggregative level, have significantly large influence on optimal policies"", the indicated biases nevertheless suggest that the introduction of uncertainty does significantly alter the description of economies growing along optimal paths.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a507-510..htm,10.2307/2297162

Shefrin'],"1981, vol. 48, issue 3, 511-519",[],"In this paper I develop an N-person stochastic game in which each player views himself as facing a Markov decision process. Specifically, every player is assumed to choose his strategy as a policy which is optimal with respect to the process in question. It is clear that such a strategy need not be a best reply to the strategy choices of the other players, so a Nash equilibrium might not be appropriate for this game. Consider the following alternative equilibrium concept. Every player compares the subjective transition probabilities from his Markov decision process with the objective frequencies which he encounters during the course of the game. If no player receives disconfirming evidence about the subjective probabilities he is using, then the game is said to be in informational equilibrium. In this case the subjective probabilities are termed self-generating. Clearly, an informational equilibrium falls into the class of fulfilled expectations or rational equilibria. The main result of the paper is that an informational equilibrium exists for the game under consideration. The motivation for studying this particular class of games derives from the microeconomic treatment of household and firm intertemporal decisions under uncertainty. In economic theory it is common to treat these decision problems within a dynamic programming Markov decision process framework.' Here Markov transistion probabilities are used to describe the random prices faced by households and the random demand functions faced by firms. A question which would seem to be of considerable interest involves the problem of how one might model a complete economy in which each agent treats his own decision problem as a Markov decision process. Choosing an appropriate equilibrium concept would naturally be of paramount importance. This is the essential issue with which the present paper is concerned.

The analysis shows that the introduction of risk-shifting arrangements into models of incomplete information eliminates the dependence of the relation between aggregate demand and aggregate employment on the relative strengths of the usual substitution and income effects on labor supply of perceived real wage rates or perceived real interest rates. In addition, the analysis shows that the apparent fact that workers choose an amount of risk shifting that gives them constant nominal wage rates implies that incomplete information would produce a positive effect of aggregate demand on aggregate employment. The key to these results is that risk shifting allows workers to use the value of product associated with high levels of demand to supplement the income associated with low levels of demand. Consequently, they can choose high employment instates of high demand without causing a corresponding reduction in their expected marginal utility of consumption.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a189-197..htm,10.2307/2296879

(See also Koopmans (1957).) This gap is especially felt in macroeconomics where the basic framework is that of perfect competition and many results depend on the existence of some lag in the adjustment of prices. Here I propose a first step toward a theory of price adjustment in a competitive environment.' I shall consider here a simple exchange economy with no money. The application to the question of the real effects of changes in the money supply is discussed in a separate paper (Eden (1980)). The main cost of adjustment considered here is the cost of information about changes in aggregate excess demand. The question is who will gather and pay for the information. This public good problem is analysed in a model in which the artificial entity of the auctioneer is replaced by firms (sellers) who seek information about excess demand and announce the prices of their products. The public good aspect of the problem emerges when there is a unique optimal price which would be announced on the basis of ""old"" information shared by all participants. Then if a single firm buys ""new"" information and announces a different price all firms which are aware of this revised price will rightly think that it is based on updated information and will therefore follow the lead. In this case the announced price transmits all the relevant new information to all firms and the firm that updates the information therefore provides that public good which in the Walrasian model is provided by the auctioneer.2 The question is which firm will undertake the function of 'the auctioneer? The solution suggested here is that all firms will adopt a mixed strategy in which they undertake this function with a certain probability. It is shown however that there is always a positive probability that the prices advertised in a particular market will not be based on updated information, since otherwise there would be no incentive to buy information. In the second section I describe the process of advertising prices for the case in which the aggregate demand that sellers in a particular market face is exogenously given and infinitely elastic. I then discuss the type of framework required to justify such demand curves and show that, in general, the Walrasian price is not the average of advertised prices.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a199-216..htm,10.2307/2296880

If a profession is ""self-regulating"", in the sense that its current members, being the sole suppliers of a certain type of service, are free to determine, in one way or another, whether or not to admit a potential recruit, then it might seem prima facie that such a profession could simply be regarded as a monopolistic seller of the service in question, so that the effects of self-regulation would appear to involve an unambiguous welfare loss. The whole rationale for self-regulation, however, rests on the notion that it provides a vehicle through which the quality of the service may be maintained in markets where the consumer cannot readily measure this quality himself. It is the analysis of the interplay of these two elements, the enhanced price of such services associated with the monopolistic power of the profession, and the improved quality of the service which may accompany a reduction in supply, which forms the focus of the present paper.

In recent years there have been numerous contributions to the ""nonconvexity problem"" in the context of models with a finite-dimensional commodity space. In the capital theory context non-convexities have received explicit treatment in a few papers, in two distinguishable ways. The problem is cast either in a discrete-time framework (Aoki (1971), Rothschild (1971)) or in a continuous-time framework in which there are implicitly unbounded economies of scale in investment. The latter formulation leads to ""jumps"" in the state variable or lumpy investment, the standard problem treated is one of decreasing costs in the installation of new capacity (contributions include Chenery (1952), Dixit, Mirrlees and Stern (1975), Hartwick (1976), Manne (1967), Srinivasan (1967), Starrett (1978), and Weitzman (1970)). These types of analysis unfortunately ignore some of the most interesting problems associated with non-convexities in investment theory. In a discrete-time framework the important distinction between stocks and flows is blurred, while the capacity-installation problem, by admitting unbounded scale economies, excludes the ""smoothing"" of state variables that follows by allowing for eventually increasing costs of adjustment. In this paper we undertake a systematic examination of non-convexities' (or sometimes non-concavities) in the context of a classic problem in continuous-time investment theory-the optimal accumulation of capital by a firm maximizing its present value over an infinite horizon. While the results obtained are specific to this particular model we feel that they can be qualitatively extended to any capital-theory problem which can be cast in a continuous-time optimal-control-theory framework. There are various sorts of non2 convexities which can arise in these problems. First, there can be either stock or flow non-convexities; that is, non-convexities which are introduced into the net benefit function (the measure of the flow of benefits at each moment) through changes in the capital stock (state variable) on the one hand or changes in the flow of investment (control variable) on the other. If the benefit and transition functions are not concave in both these variables then necessary conditions are no longer sufficient for optimality and conventional marginal analysis fails. Non-convexities can also be introduced into the value functional, which has a stock dimension. In order to examine these different sorts of non-convexity problems we shall now present the basic economic problem. A firm is faced with the problem of maximizing the present value of discounted cash flow over an infinite horizon.

This theory applies to a special class of cases in which the von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility hypothesis is used to explain these responses. Under this hypothesis, individuals who maximize the expected utility of different utility functions will in general make different choices in the face of uncertainty. For the purpose of predicting which of two different utility functions will lead to locally ""more risk averse"" economic behaviour, the essential feature of these functions is their associated Arrow-Pratt absolute risk aversion measures. In fact, the local comparisons can be extended to global comparisons if the Arrow-Pratt absolute measures are uniformly comparable. The Arrow-Pratt measure of absolute risk aversion and a closely related measure of relative risk aversion also play crucial roles in the investigation of changes, induced by wealth increases, in the risk-taking behaviour of a single expected utility maximizing individual. This study has resulted in a satisfactory theory of increasing, decreasing and constant absolute and relative risk aversion. The special cases to which the Arrow-Pratt theory is directly applicable are those in which the utility functions in question are functions of a single variable, e.g. wealth. Unfortunately, the models required to explain many economic decisions employ a version of the expected utility hypothesis in which the argument of the utility function is a multidimensional vector. One example arises in the study of the consumption-savings decision. Another occurs in the analysis of the combined consumption-savings, portfolio decision. A final example is obtained in the investigation of demand for goods of uncertain quality. The papers of Kihlstrom-Mirman (1974) and Diamond-Stiglitz (1974) have suggested a partial generalization of the Arrow-Pratt theory of absolute risk aversion.

In the present paper I argue that the assumption of a constant rate of population growth is implausible in an economy constrained by exhaustible resources, and examine the implications of making the population growth rate a function of consumption and capital per capita. This simple modification alters the characteristics of the steady state in a number of interesting ways.

2081,Review of Economic Studies,Corporate Tax Policy and the Service Life of Capital Equipment,['James Malcomson'],"1981, vol. 48, issue 2, 311-316",[],"There is a well-known result for the standard putty-clay vintage model that, in comparing two firms on steady-state growth paths with different ratios of the wage rate to the capital cost of machines, the service life of vintages (which is constant along a steady-state path) will be the same if the ex ante production function is Cobb-Douglas. It can, for example, be derived from King (1972) and Feldstein and Rothschild (1974). The purpose of this paper is to provide three extensions of this result. The first is to show that it applies more widely than just to steady-state growth and can therefore be used to prove results about the effect of corporate tax changes on the service life of capital equipment for firms which are not in steady-state growth. The second is to show that the Cobb-Douglas is the only ex ante production function for which it is generally true. The third is to extend it to models with many types of capital goods. Most putty-clay models assume a single product produced by a single type of capital good. To generalize this but retain the vintage concept requires some element that is common to all vintages of a given type of equipment. Define this common element as the capital service produced by that type. Then the production process can be divided, on a conceptual level, into two parts, the first being the production of capital services by vintages and some current inputs and the second the combination of capital services and other current inputs to produce outputs. For a more detailed discussion of this, see Malcomson (1972, Chapter 1). Consider one type of capital good. The term ""machine"" will be used as the unit of quantity for a given vintage. Constant returns to scale is assumed in the production of capital services of this type but not elsewhere in the production process. For vintage v let A (v) be the labour-machine ratio, f(A, v) the output of capital services of one machine with labour-machine ratio A (v) at time v, q (v) the purchase price net of the present value of any tax allowances, and U(v) the set of intervals of ages at which it is actually used in production. U(v) therefore consists of a series of intervals which can be denoted [0, Li(v)], [L2(v), L3(v)], . . . where Li(v), i = 1, ... , J (J assumed finite), denotes an age at which vintage v is taken out of service temporarily if i is odd and brought back into service if i is even. Its service life L(v) is given by L(v) = Lj(v). It is assumed that f1(A, v) > 0, f11(A, v) < 0. Let p3(t) be the discount factor applied to time t, w(t) the wage rate of a unit of labour at time t and 0(t) the corporate tax rate at time t. All these functions are assumed continuous in time. Finally, to allow for machine decay (or its negative, disembodied technological progress), let a be the rate of output decay so that the output of capital services of one machine of vintage v at time t is f(A, v)e -8(t-v) and let 1 be the rate at which labour input increases with age so that labour input for one machine of vintage v at time t is A (v)e (t-). a and f will be negative if disembodied technological progress outweighs machine decay.

The GHO analysis was based on a short-run model in which the locations of firms are assumed to be fixed. CVO accordingly proposed relaxation of this rigid assumption to examine if the GHO results also apply to the long-run zero-profit industry equilibrium. They confirmed the GHO results, which, however, they also contended, require certain particular modifications as well in the light of their own models. The CVO contribution lies in their simple model analysis of long-run industry equilibrium conditions-a generalization of the GHO analysis. However, they failed to recognize that the GHO analysis is based on another restrictive assumption regarding the form of the demand function. Moreover, they assumed even more restrictive demand conditions and misled themselves to a conclusion that L6schian competition never results in a lower price than spatial monopoly. Their conclusion is invalid since Loschian competition can be shown to result in a lower (not higher) mill price if only the demand function is assumed to be sufficiently convex to the origin (Ohta (1980)). This calls for a more general examination of conditions under which the firm's f.o.b. mill price may rise or fall due to spatial entry of rival firms. The present paper presents selected results of such examination. Section 2 briefly reviews the theory of spatial monopoly. Initially some fundamental assumptions are set forth. This is followed by derivation of the market demand function for the spatial monopolist. The market demand in turn is shown to be more or less elastic than the assumed basic demand function depending on the curvature of the latter curve. We also comment on the so-called ""paradox of spatial monopoly"", which we claim is a misnomer. The analytical framework of Section 2 is employed in Section 3 as we generalize previous analyses and present a concise cataloguing of comparative static results of spatial competition.1 Again the basic demand characteristics, in combination with alternative types of spatial competition, are shown to play an important role in yielding the distinct elasticity results, and for that matter competitive equilibrium prices. In the process a counter-example to CVO's aforementioned argument on L6schian pricing is presented. Also discussed is the conceptual distinction between perceived and realized elasticities of demand under spatial competition, which CVO also failed to recognize. As a result, they erred in speculating that equilibrium mill prices would be the same under alternative types of spatial competition, given the size of the market area. We will show that they in fact are not.

There are two traditional approaches. (1) Following Kuhn (1959), boundary conditions on C yield existence, (2) Following Gale and Nikaido (1965), conditions on the Jacobian matrix of C and its principal minors yield uniqueness. In the first approach Kuhn (1959) proposed the Intensity Hypothesis to guarantee the existence of a factor price for which complete diversification of production is compatible with competitive equilibrium. Later this condition was examined through the Section 3.3 of the survey paper of international trade theory by Chipman (1966),2 and modified into a more general form. In the second approach the condition on the interior of the domain by Gale and Nikaido has been significantly weakened by Mas-Colell (1979). This paper combines a weaker boundary condition with a weaker Jacobian condition to obtain both. In the following sections we clarify the implication of the Intensity Hypothesis, and show that under the non-reversal condition of factor intensities it guarantees not only the existence, but also the uniqueness of a factor price vector.

2089,Review of Economic Studies,Market Power in a Non-Malleable City,['Neil Vousden'],"1981, vol. 48, issue 1, 3-19",[],"In a recent paper, Markusen and Scheffman (1978) (M & S) have examined the effects of ownership concentration in urban land markets on the equilibrium land use pattern in a circular city. At the heart of their approach is the observation that (a) the natural upper bound on the supply of land within any fixed distance x from the CBD constitutes an effective barrier to entry, and therefore, (b) a landowner who owns a ""significant proportion"" of land at x has market power to the extent that he can affect the rent profile for the city by withholding some or all of his land. In particular M & S show that the existence of a ""large landowner"" in the above sense may imply the existence of vacant land at points inside the city boundary as the landowner withholds some of his land in order to force up rents and make a higher profit on the land which he does not leave vacant. The city analysed by M & S is the familiar circular one with all employment in the CBD and all residents located in a sequence of concentric dormitory suburbs. In particular housing is assumed perfectly malleable and divisible (or, equivalently, M & S are looking at cities which are instantaneously built from nothing to their present form). It has been demonstrated by the author in Vousden (1980) that such an approach to urban housing cannot be assumed to provide a valid description of a city even in the long run. In addition it prevents us from looking at a range of interesting real-world urban phenomena such as demolition of older housing. This paper extends the M & S model to allow for non-malleable, indivisible housing. The general framework is a simplified version of that employed in Vousden (1980). As in that paper and in M & S, developers and households will be assumed to hold static price expectations. The general outline of the paper is as follows. Section 1 presents those basic elements of the model which are common to a competitive city and a city with a large landowner. Section 2 summarizes the properties of a non-malleable competitive city. Section 3 presents the problem faced by a profit maximizing large landowner (LL) and compares the competitive city of Section 2 with a city containing a single LL as well as a large number of competitive developers (CD's).' The broad spirit of M & S' results are shown to carry over here. In particular, it is shown that the large landowner will act in a way which pushes up the rent profile for the city and thereby increases the radius of the city.2 However LL has a widei range of devices for bringing about an upward shift in the rent function than is the case in [M & S]. In the malleable model his choice is between supplying the same output of housing services as CD's at a given location or simply withholding land from the market. In our model he can affect urban rents by (a) withholding vacant land (as in M & S); (b) supplying housing of a lower density than CD's at a given location; (c) delaying upward redevelopment at a particular location longer than CD's; (d) leaving existing structures unoccupied (abandonment). In particular M & S' result that LL will withhold land near the city boundary carries over",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a3-19..htm,10.2307/2297117

2091,Review of Economic Studies,Jobs as Dam Sites,['George Akerlof'],"1981, vol. 48, issue 1, 37-49",[],"Much economic analysis is based on stylized relations between the nature of economic processes and the functions economists use as their tools of analysis. For example, if production processes are duplicable, constant returns to scale production functions are obtained. The student of elementary economics is told that if goods are difficult to substitute, their demand is inelastic; if easy to substitute their demand is elastic. In similar fashion it is the purpose of this paper to categorize the nature of jobs and to show that it has implications for the elasticity of demand for labour with respect to the wage. We see a job as like a dam site. A dam which underutilizes a dam site, even though productive in the sense that water is usefully stored or electricity is usefully produced, will nevertheless be costly in the sense that the valuable dam site is wasted. Even at zero cost (and hence a benefit/cost ratio of infinity) it may not pay to use a dam which underutilizes the site. We picture jobs and workers in the same way. Jobs are pictured as being like dam sites and workers of different skills as being like the potential dams on the dam site. Workers of sufficiently low skills will not be able to get jobs even at zero wages, not because their output on those jobs is negative, but because they underutilize the jobs themselves. Nor may it matter that the firm will have to pay significantly positive wages to hire skilled workers on its jobs. This image of the job gives reason for pessimism about the wage elasticity of demand for labour of a given skill, since it says that unskilled workers, no matter how low they bid their wages, may still be unable to bid jobs away from skilled workers. This has at least five consequences. First, it shows that in a demand downturn, in which prices of final goods and services are below the full employment level, wage flexibility alone will not be sufficient to restore full employment. Skilled workers will receive jobs and positive wages; unskilled workers will not be able to capture jobs even at zero wages. Second, the minimum wage is often considered a major cause of unemployment in general and among youth in particular (see Feldstein (1973) for one example). The effects of minimum wages on employment depends critically on the wage elasticity of demand, which is low for unskilled workers if, as in our argument, they cannot capture jobs even at zero wages. Third, Feldstein among others (1973, pp. 19-26) has argued that wage subsidies should be paid to encourage employees to hire youth in ladder jobs. Feldstein's recommendation rests implicitly on the belief that the elasticity of demand for such youths in such jobs is fairly high-at least in the sense that employers would more than willingly hire such workers with sufficient reduction of the minimum wage. Wage costs thus serve as an upper bound to his estimates of the costs of such programmes. If, on the other hand, jobs are as pictured in this paper, like dam sites, even at a zero wage firms may be quite unwilling to hire unskilled workers in ladder jobs because they may underutilize the ladder jobs themselves. The other side to the subsidy issue is manpower training programmes. Such programmes have been strongly criticized in the US for their high cost per worker. Implicit in much of this criticism has been the comparison with on-the-job training on the supposition",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a37-49..htm,10.2307/2297119

Andrieu (1974) and Razin (1974) have also generalized the Marshall-Hicks rules to the case where there is one output and three inputs, but one of the inputs is fixed.' However, since most real life firms or industries produce a wide variety of products, it would appear to be useful to obtain rules for the price elasticity of derived supply for an output, where other output and input markets are allowed to adjust to the change in the price of the first output. The recent increases in energy prices have perhaps provided a reason for renewed interest in the microeconomic determinants of industry supply. In Section 5 below, we derive analogues to the Marshall-Hicks-Sato-Koizumi Rules in a multiple output framework. In Section 2, we list our assumptions on the technology and note some preliminary results from duality theory. In Section 3, we define the elasticity of derived (net) supply and we show that it will always be nonnegative in our model. We also compare the elasticity of derived supply, which takes into account adjustments induced by an increase in the price of the output in other input and output markets, with an ordinary price elasticity of supply, which holds the prices of the other inputs and outputs fixed. We also compare the above two elasticities with intermediate elasticities of derived supply that are obtained by assuming that some input and output prices are fixed but others are not. We find that the more markets that adjust to the price increase in the first market, the smaller the elasticity of derived supply becomes in the first market. We could term this an inverse Le Chatelier principle, since it acts in a manner which is seemingly opposite to the usual Le Chatelier principle (cf. Samuelson (1947), pp. 36-39), which says that the more markets that we allow to adjust to the effects of a price increase in the first market, the larger is the elasticity of supply in the first market. However, the two Le Chatelier principles are not really opposed. As we shall see later, our inverse Le Chatelier principle formally contains Samuelson's Le Chatelier principle as a special case. In Section 4, we consider the comparative statics effects of an exogenous increase in the price of the first good on a weighted average of other prices as well as on a weighted average of changes in the industry supply of other outputs and changes in the industry demand for other inputs, taking into account the ""general equilibrium"" repercussions on other markets of the increase in the price of the first good.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a63-80..htm,10.2307/2297121
2094,Review of Economic Studies,Duality Theory and Functional Forms for Dynamic Factor Demands,['Larry Epstein'],"1981, vol. 48, issue 1, 81-95",[],"A large body of empirical studies of factor demand systems (Christensen, Jorgenson and Lau (1973), Berndt and Christensen (1973), Fuss and McFadden (1978)) is based on the assumption of instantaneous adjustment by firms to prevailing prices. An exhaustive set of integrability conditions derived from the theory of static profit maximization is applied to guide the specification of functional forms and to motivate meaningful hypotheses to be tested or maintained. In contrast, such a sound theoretical basis is lacking for most of the empirical literature on dynamic factor demand (investment and employment) models. For example, Jorgenson (1965) appends an ad hoc lag structure to a theory of static profit maximization to generate an investment demand function. The recent developments in the adjustmentcost model of the firm (Lucas (1967), Treadway (1969), (1971), Mortensen (1973)) have provided a consistent dynamic theoretical framework for the determination of all inputs and outputs. Yet there still remains a gap between the theoretical model and most econometric factor demand models (Schramm (1970), Nadiri and Rosen (1969), Brechling (1975)); the latter maintain a flexible accelerator adjustment with constant adjustment coefficients while the theory implies that the flexible accelerator is generally optimal only locally in a neighbourhood of the steady state and that the adjustment coefficients generally depend on exogenous variables. (See Treadway (1974).) The studies cited also fail to relate satisfactorily the hypothesized adjustment matrices to the specified technologies. They thereby overlook some of the testable properties of the theory. Only Berndt, Fuss and Waverman (1977) have estimated a model that is fully consistent with the adjustment-cost theory. The objective of this paper is to describe a practical procedure for generating a large class of functional forms for dynamic factor demand functions that can be used to test and apply the adjustment-cost theory of the firm. Three limitations of the approach adopted by Berndt, Fuss and Waverman may be noted. First, their approach is practical only when there is a single quasi-fixed stock (or (footnote 6) perhaps at most when there are two quasi-fixed stocks). Second, the flexible accelerator is the only adjustment mechanism that can follow from their approach. Finally, they assume that firms expect current prices to persist indefinitely. In contrast the procedure developed below is applicable to any number of quasi-fixed stocks and is capable of generating a richer class of dynamic adjustment mechanisms, e.g. the hump-shaped lag distributions that have been estimated in the empirical literature on investment (Evans (1969; pp. 95-105)) and which have been modelled by various ad hoc lag structures such as the Almon, Pascal and rational distributed lags. However, the assumption of static expectations, common in the adjustment-cost literature, is maintained.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a81-95..htm,10.2307/2297122
2095,Review of Economic Studies,Spatial Competition and Spatial Price Discrimination,['George Norman'],"1981, vol. 48, issue 1, 97-111",[],"The analysis of spatial competition under conditions of free entry, which derives its major impetus from the seminal work of Losch (1954), has been conducted, in general, on the assumption that the competitive firm will adopt an f.o.b. pricing scheme-see, for example, Capozza and van Order (1978), and Holahan (1978). Greenhut (1956) does consider some of the implications of discriminatory pricing within competitive markets, but his analysis adopts an essentially short-run view, and provides little rationale for the choice of such a pricing policy by competitive firms. This is in contrast with developments in the analysis of spatial monopoly. The early work of Singer (1937) and Hoover (1937) and subsequent developments by, for example, Greenhut (1956), Beckmann (1976), Beckmann and Ingene (1976), Greenhut and Greenhut (1977), Holahan (1975) and Norman (1977), indicate that the spatial monopolist should adopt a discriminatory spatial pricing policy (where spatial price discrimination is taken, conventionally, to mean that delivered prices do not follow an f.o.b. scheme, but that all concumers equidistant from a particular supplier pay the same price). It is rarely, however, that the results generated by the analysis of spatial monopoly are reconsidered in the analysis of spatial competition. In particular, although we know that spatial price discrimination will, in general, increase a monopolist's profit, the assumption that profit maximising, spatially competitive, firms will adopt f.o.b. pricing schemes has rarely been questioned, and has not been questioned within the Loschian competitive framework; Greenhut and Ohta (1975a), Chapter 8 and Chapter 8, Appendix I, are notable exceptions, but in both cases they depart from the Loschian scheme. The first objective of this paper is, therefore, to show that, when Loschian competitive firms are allowed the option of discriminatory pricing, i.e. are free of institutional constraints which require f.o.b. pricing, they will be forced to exercise that option in order to maintain normal profits. Secondly, we shall show that, if competitive conditions change, the form of price discrimination will also change, and that under certain competitive conditions the degree of discrimination will increase with the degree of competition, leading eventually to uniform pricing. Thirdly, we compare two competitive cases with multi-plant monopoly and derive the spatial analogue of the conventional, spaceless, monopoly/perfect competition comparison. The monopolist's plants will be larger, in area and total output, than each competitive firm, but will supply less per consumer at a higher average price. Welfare comparisons are less clear-cut, in that they are dependent upon the type of competition we assume. We show, however, that welfare maximisation requires marginal cost pricing, where marginal cost includes transport costs, and so requires f.o.b. pricing. If there are economies of scale to production it follows that welfare maximisation will require production subsidy.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a97-111..htm,10.2307/2297123
2096,Review of Economic Studies,On the Local Uniqueness of the Fixed Price Equilibria,['Guy Laroque'],"1981, vol. 48, issue 1, 113-129",[],"A number of recent works have addressed the problem of describing the allocation of resources in an economy where prices are fixed at a value that may not achieve equilibrium of supply and demand in the classical sense. It seems that, by and large, through the works of Benassy (1975), Dreze (1975), Malinvaud-Younes (1977) and Younes (1975), agreement has been reached as to the properties that an allocation should possess when transactions take place at given arbitrary fixed prices. The purpose of this paper is to present a result in comparative statics which applies in this approach. In the framework of an exchange economy, a necessary and sufficient condition for the local uniqueness of the fixed price allocation in a neighbourhood of a competitive equilibrium is established. Under this condition, in a neighbourhood of the competitive allocation, the fixed price equilibrium is locally a continuous function of the price system, a prerequisite for most studies in comparative statics. This condition can be related to the stability of the quantity adjustment process associated with fixed price equilibria in a neighbourhood of the competitive equilibrium. As is suggested by Samuelson's principle of correspondence, stability implies local uniqueness, while the converse is not true. Finally, it is shown that the fixed price equilibria are both locally unique and stable when the commodities are substitutes for the rationed consumers. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model and results, the main proofs are gathered in Section 3 while an appendix gives the properties of the derivatives of the consumer's demands. The mathematical tools involved are first a generalization of the inverse function theorem for Lipschitzian functions due to Clarke (1976) and second the identity of Sylvester for determinants (Gantmacher (1966, pp. 32-33)).",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a113-129..htm,10.2307/2297124
2097,Review of Economic Studies,"Transaction Costs, Uncertainty and Generally Inactive Futures Markets",['H. M. Shefrin'],"1981, vol. 48, issue 1, 131-137",[],"Transaction costs were originally introduced into the competitive equilibrium framework in order to explain the sequential pattern of trade that is observed in the real world. This pattern exhibits the following two properties: 1. The bulk of trading activity is conducted on spot markets; 2. Futures trading, when it occurs, tends to cluster around the delivery date. The existing theory of competitive equilibrium with transaction costs seems only to have considered the case of certainty.1 In the present paper I contend that the trading pattern just described only emerges as a special case in the certainty framework, but become generic once uncertainty is admitted. The intuition underlying this result is quite straightforward. By assumption, all trading (both spot and futures) requires that transaction costs be incurred. Notice that with uncertainty only spot contracts stipulate certain delivery. In contrast, an individual futures contract stipulates delivery contingent on some future event which may or may not occur. Consequently most potential contingent contracts would not result in delivery despite the fact that transaction costs were incurred when these contracts were traded. As a result, there will be present a strong tendency to economize on transaction costs by avoiding futures markets. Of course, this need not mean that no futures market is active. Yet the same principle explains why we should not expect to see very many contracts for delivery far into the future: the closer together are the transaction data and the delivery date, the greater the number of events whose occurrence can be ruled out. The above argument does not apply to the certainty framework because all contracts (both spot and futures) result in certain delivery. Therefore, although trading will be timed so that transaction costs are incurred at the most convenient date, there is no structural reason why transaction and delivery dates need be close together. The discussion can be made rigorous by adding uncertainty to the Hahn (1973)-Starrett (1973) transaction costs model. This serves to illuminate the precise way that competitive prices induce the trading pattern under discussion.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a131-137..htm,10.2307/2297125
2098,Review of Economic Studies,A Combinatorial Analysis of the Overlapping Generations Model,['Stephen A. Clark'],"1981, vol. 48, issue 1, 139-145",[],"The efficient production and Pareto-optimal distribution of goods over an infinite time horizon pose well-known theoretical difficulties for the competitive price mechanism. Malinvaud (1953) originally analysed this problem for a pure production model and he was followed by many others. In particular, the functional analysis approach by Radner (1967) and the differentiability approach by Peleg and Yaari (1970) are noteworthy. On the other hand, Samuelson (1958) and Starrett (1972) studied a pure distribution model yielding an analogue of Malinvaud's interest-rate theorems. In addition, Clark (1979) has provided a more general analysis of the pure distribution economy in the spirit of Malinvaud. There is also some work on models involving both production and distribution by Bose (1974) and by McFadden, Mitra, and Majumdar (1976, 1980). Malinvaud discovered that the efficiency of a competitive production program depends upon the accumulation of capital. Let Vt represent the present value of the capital stock available at time t. Then the existence of strictly positive competitive prices which satisfy Malinvaud's transversality condition, lim inf V, = 0, implies that the production program is efficient. The capital value V, also plays a critical role in Malinvaud's proof of the existence of competitive prices for efficient programs. A price system satisfies the terminal cost minimization condition (at time t) if it minimizes V, among all production programs at least as good as the given program beyond time t. Malinvaud proved that an efficient program is supported by a competitive price system satisfying the terminal cost minimization for any finite time horizon, and he used this added condition to push the horizon to infinity. Starrett later discovered an analogue of the terminal cost minimization condition for the pure distribution model, using a different definition for V,. Now let V, represent the present value of the past consumption stream of the population alive at time t + 1. Starrett used this concept only to prove his interest-rate theorems, but the analogue does not stop here. Competitive distribution programs are not always Pareto-optimal (see Starrett for an example). If the preferences are convex and have no satiation points, however, then a competitive distribution program such that lim inf Vt = 0 must be Pareto-optimal. Indeed this assertion can be proved in the manner of Malinvaud's transversality theorem. Perhaps the definition of V, shocks an economist's intuition. Yet the present value of capital stock is universally recognized as a measure of the sacrifice in current consumption for the sake of future production. The present value of the past consumption of the population alive at time t+ 1 has an analogous interpretation for the pure distribution economy. It signifies the sacrifice in consumption of those consumers who die before time t + 1 for the sake of those consumers who live after time period t. Thus current generations",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a139-145..htm,10.2307/2297126

2100,Review of Economic Studies,Recovering Cardinal Utility,"['Philip Dybvig', 'Heraklis Polemarchakis']","1981, vol. 48, issue 1, 159-166",[],"Individual choice under uncertainty depends on an agent's attitudes towards risk, typically represented by his von Neumann-Morgenstern cardinal utility function, u. This function is, of course, an unobservable characteristic. What is, at least in principal, observable is the agent's demand for alternative assets. Problems of prediction and welfare often require conclusions to be drawn concerning the unobservable characteristics based on observable behaviour. To predict the response to a change in the stochastic production plan of a firm, or to determine the compensation necessary so as to avoid a loss in welfare due to a change in the capital tax structure, knowledge of an agent's attitude towards risk is required. It is the purpose of the present paper to demonstrate that, as long as the joint distribution of returns of the available assets is known, the cardinal utility function can be recovered without ambiguity from asset demands, provided that the set of available assets contains a riskless asset. The distinguishing characteristic of the recoverability problem as posed here is the possible incompleteness of markets. In a framework of complete markets, if nominal income and prices vary independently, the range of the demand correspondence can be assumed to cover an open subset of the consumption set. The utility function can then be immediately recovered, up to a monotone transformation, over this range, given mild regularity conditions on demand behaviour. Given incomplete markets, however, this argument fails. Since the choice set is a lower dimensional subspace of state space, we learn only about the agent's preferences within this subspace. We show that the existence of a riskless asset (and some risky asset) implies recoverability of von NeumannMorgenstern preferences, even if markets are incomplete. In the presence of a riskless asset, any positive, riskless level, a, of wealth is demanded for some asset prices. Using arguments from Pratt (1964), the ratio u'(a)/u'(a) can be recovered without ambiguity for all positive (resp. non-negative) values of a, and hence, an integration argument can be used to recover the cardinal utility function, u, up to a positive affine transformation. Beyond the argument based on knowledge of the asset demand correspondence, we explore an alternative approach to recoverability. We demonstrate that knowledge of the portfolio indifference surfaces permits recovery of the cardinal utility function, provided there is a riskless asset. The intuition here is that the agent's risk aversion is directly related to the curvature of the indifference curve around the riskless point and the variance of the risky asset(s). That this approach is in general equivalent to the demand correspondence approach is well known-we give a brief proof for twice continuously differentiable and strictly monotone utility functions. We point out two results concerning the informational requirements of the argument for recoverability. Specifically, the argument does not require complete knowledge of the distribution of returns independently of the asset demands. Instead, it suffices to know the mean and variance of the returns to just one asset other than the riskless, and the return of the riskless asset. Furthermore, if the demand for assets is known only on a subset of the",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a159-166..htm,10.2307/2297128

Although the approach in this paper is rather traditional, the necessary and sufficient condition for establishing the uniqueness is completely discussed. In his classic paper on three Hicksian laws, Morishima (1960) showed that the competitive equilibrium is unique under the assumptions of weak gross substitutability and indecomposability.1 We will show that his reasoning and a view with a slightly different approach lead to the conclusion that a weaker version of indecomposability is necessary and sufficient for establishing the uniqueness of competitive equilibrium price. 2 Section 2 deals with the necessary and sufficient condition for the uniqueness. In Section 3, some historical considerations will be made on Morishima's uniqueness theorem in its relation to ours.

2102,Review of Economic Studies,Heterogeneous Labour and the Fundamental Marxian Theorem,['Ulrich Krause'],"1981, vol. 48, issue 1, 173-178",[],"As was pointed out by Morishima at the end of his famous book on Marx's Economics, the heterogeneity of labour is a ""serious dilemma"" for Marx's theory of exploitation, especially for the so called Fundamental Marxian Theorem. The problem, which should be separated from the peculiarities of joint production, consists in finding an appropriate reduction of the various types of labour to one common unit. Recently Bowles and Gintis have undertaken an interesting reformulation of the Marxian theory of value with respect to heterogeneous labour by avoiding any reduction at all (Bowles and Gintis 1977, 1978. Cf. also Steedman 1977, Holliinder 1978). But for the purpose of the Fundamental Marxian Theorem this only shifts the problem from the heterogeneity of labour to the heterogeneity of the respective rates of exploitation. The aim of the present paper is to extend the Fundamental Marxian Theorem (without joint production) from homogeneous to heterogeneous labour (Section 3). This extension is based on a new concept called the standard reduction of labour, because of its dual relationship to Sraffa's standard commodity (Section 2). For some arguments a certain type of matrices, called Sraffa matrices, is needed, which generalize the quasiirreducible matrices as introduced by Bowles and Gintis (Appendix). Standard reduction implies always a uniform rate of exploitation, whereas the same is true for the reduction by wage rates only in special cases (for example: uniform consumption; labour inputs only; prices proportional to labour values. For the first two cases cf. Morishima 1978). Hence, in general standard reduction and reduction by wage rates are different.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a48_3ay_3a1981_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a173-178..htm,10.2307/2297130

2110,Review of Economic Studies,Evidence on the Impact of Income Distribution on Consumer Demand in the UK 1955–68,['Peter Simmons'],"1980, vol. 47, issue 5, 893-906",[],"In the theoretical literature there are several results available concerning conditions under which market demand is independent of the distribution of personal incomes. A closely related question concerns the conditions under which a representative consumer exists (who may have the mean or some other level of income) and, again, some theoretical results are available. On the other hand the emphasis of much of the empirical literature has been more on providing point estimates of parameters of individual demand functions or Engel curves than on hypothesis testing (Muellbauer and Deaton (1978)). Exceptions to this are the work of Doorn (1975) who used cross section data for two years and a simple model to estimate Engel curves for five commodities taking into account variations in family size. He found that the income distribution did not add at all to the explanation of consumption expenditure achieved by using aggregate income. However of course his result is conditional on his assumptions: that income, family size and consumption expenditures are all distributed independently as lognormal variables, that income distribution effects are independent of price effects and that the Engel curves are loglinear. This last assumption is particularly limiting since, if interpreted in a global fashion, it is not consistent with a budget constraint. The estimation itself also does not take account of the budget constraint. Similarly, in the context of the aggregate consumption function, Blinder (1975) found that it was difficult to determine a form of consumption function in which the distribution of income, however measured, played a significant role in determining consumption decisions. Of course price effects and the detailed allocation of consumer expenditure between commodity groups were ignored. More recently Berndt et al. (1977) have provided point",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a893-906..htm,10.2307/2296920
2111,Review of Economic Studies,Direct and Indirect Trade Utility Functions,['Alan Woodland'],"1980, vol. 47, issue 5, 907-926",[],"In this paper the concept of an indirect trade utility function is introduced, its properties are developed, and its application to the theory of international trade and to the econometric estimation of export supply and import demand functions are discussed. The indirect trade utility function expresses the maximum level of utility a trading nation can attain, assuming the existence of a direct community utility function, as a function of a vector of prices for commodities, a vector of factor endowments and the balance of trade. As such it provides a summary of all the consumption and production decisions within a competitive economy. In Section 2 the indirect trade utility function is defined in terms of the ordinary indirect utility function and the gross national product (or variable profit) function. An extension of Roy's Identity is developed, allowing the easy generation of net export functions by differentiation. The fact that the derivatives of the indirect trade utility function with respect to the prices of commodities are proportional to the excess supply or net export functions implies that indirect utility is stationary at a closed equilibrium. It is then proved that the set of price vectors which minimize the indirect trade utility function coincides with the set of closed equilibrium price vectors. Section 3 specifies the properties of the indirect trade utility function implied by the model and then illustrates various applications in the theory of international trade. These include the welfare effects of divergence of prices from autarky levels and the characterization of optimal tariff structures. Section 4 briefly considers the extent to which the results of Section 2 can be extended to the case where there are many consumers. In Section 5 the relationship between the indirect trade utility function and the direct trade utility function of Meade, and between the latter and the direct utility function and the production possibility set are outlined. Section 6 is devoted to establishing rigorously the formal relationships between all these functions under quite general conditions. The results of this section serve to widen the application of duality theory, as surveyed by Diewert (1974), (1978b) for example, to the area of international trade theory. Some of the results on the direct trade utility function have previously been developed by Chipman (1970) in unpublished notes, but he did not consider the indirect trade utility function. In Section 7 the usefulness of the indirect trade utility function in generating functional forms for export and import demand functions and factor price functions suitable for the purposes of econometric estimation using data on prices, net exports and factor endowments is discussed. Section 8 concludes the paper with an indication of how the model may be reinterpreted to accommodate nontraded goods and variable factor supplies. While the discussion is focussed on a national economy trading with other nations in the world market, it should be clear that the model applies equally well to the individual consumer who undertakes marketable production. Examples include the self-employed businessman or farmer. The indirect trade utility function then indicates the maximum utility attainable given the prices of the commodities (marketable products and purchasable",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a907-926..htm,10.2307/2296921

2113,Review of Economic Studies,A Neoclassical Model of the Dual Economy with Capital Accumulation in Agriculture,['Masanori Amano'],"1980, vol. 47, issue 5, 933-944",[],"An economy consisting of two production sectors, with different technologies, distribution systems and labour markets is generally referred to as the dual economy. This term has been used mainly for developing countries where the industrial and agricultural sectors differ markedly with respect to the above-mentioned aspects. Jorgenson (1967) has classified dual models for developing countries into two types, classical and neoclassical. The main difference between the two lies in their assumptions about behaviour in the agricultural sector, which in turn have a bearing on the existence of surplus labour. Although the relevance of the assumptions is an empirical question, we should also pay attention to the analysis of Dixit (1970) which shows that when surplus labour disappears in the classical model, the differences between the two are not substantial. The neoclassical model originated by Jorgenson (1961) discusses the condition for the industrial sector to emerge from the purely agrarian economy (the viability condition). That is, when per capita food production of the purely agrarian economy exceeds a critical level, the supply of both labour and food is sufficient to enable the development of the industrial sector to begin. If the "" viability "" condition is met, per capita income and the proportion of labour in industry increase monotonically. There are three points to note about Jorgenson's model. The first is that the production functions of both sectors are specified to be of the Cobb-Douglas type. The second is his assumption on the price and income elasticities of demand for food. He assumes both elasticities to be zero in the dual development process. The third is that his model either assumes away capital accumulation in agriculture or includes it in the exogenous technical progress. (See Marino (1975) and Zarembka (1970) for discussions of the first two points, and also Dixit (1973) and Marglin (1966).) In this paper an attempt is made, by relaxing the aforementioned assumptions, to elucidate some important aspects of the dual economy which are relevant from the normative as well as positive points of view, but which have so far been hardly accounted for.' Specifically, taking for granted that the viability condition for the emergence of industry is satisfied, we shall study the alternative growth processes of the dual economy. It is shown that even if the viability condition is met, a long-run equilibrium path for the dual economy may not exist, and the economy may stagnate at a low wage level attained in the purely agrarian economy. We shall also show that when the equilibrium growth path exists, the sum of the income and price elasticities of demand for food plays a crucial role in the long-run behaviour of the system. In particular, if the sum is always not larger than unity, then the long-run equilibrium is locally stable, and the economy typically sustains continual rises in per capita income and the proportion of labour in industry. On the other hand if the above sum is sufficiently larger than unity, then the equilibrium becomes",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a933-944..htm,10.2307/2296923

The conception of fairness may be extended to productive cases by taking at least four alternative ideas of distributive justice. The first of these is an extension of fair net trade, in which each should deserve his natural endowments of assets, both material and human. In other words, both the means of production and labour ability are regarded as private property. Since the endowment of assets which each possesses determines what his share shall be, this idea may be called distributive fairness according to assets. The second idea may be stated as that the inequalities in the endowments of material assets are undeserved; the material assets are converted into the common property of the whole society, while the human assets are still private property. In other words, everyone has an equal right to share in the benefits from all of the assets excluding labour. Since individuals may possess unequal amounts of labour ability, the more skilled are more successful in getting a higher level of welfare. As labour ability is the basis for distribution, this idea may be called distributive fairness according to labour. In the third idea, the human assets as well as the material ones are regarded as common property; hence everyone has an equal right to share in the benefits from social endowments of all human as well as material assets, irrespective of his own. Going a step further, we may have an idea of fairness which involves non-tradable attributes such as incapabilities and the number of dependants. This fourth idea may be called distributive fairness according to need. It is important to distinguish between these ideas of distributive fairness.

Both approaches lead to the conclusion that cycling sets tend to be large. In this paper, these studies are related to each other and to the work of Matthews (1978, 1979) on undominated directions. Simple observations lead to a new and stronger result indicating the extreme pervasiveness of global cycling.

2118,Review of Economic Studies,Structure of the Correspondence Principle at an Extremum Point,['Tatsuo Hatta'],"1980, vol. 47, issue 5, 987-997",[],"One of the most powerful principles of microeconomics is that comparative static properties of a given behavioural equation can often be derived from the postulate that it is a solution function of some extremum problem. Applying this principle, economists have individually analyzed a wide variety of specific economic models-usually through complicated derivations involving bordered Hessians. The main purpose of the present article is to derive general formulae of comparative statics for the extremum problem with many constraint functions, where the same shift parameters appear in both target and constraint functions and all of the constraint and target functions are non-linear. This problem contains most of the models whose comparative statics have been studied so far. Our method of comparative statics is related to those proposed by Houthakker (1951-52), Samuelson (1960, 1965), Diamond and McFadden (1974), Silberberg (1974) and Gorman (1976). Threefeatures distinguish the present approach from those ofthis literature. First, our method yields satisfactory comparative static conditions when constraints contain parameters. In particular, they contain the theorems of recent applied economic models whose shift parameters appear in both target and constraint functions.' Second, only unconstrained extremum conditions are used in our derivation of comparative statics for constrained extremum problems; the Lagrangean multiplier method is dispensed with as an analytical tool. Third, the present framework yields heuristic proofs of both the Lagrangean method and the Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The method may be outlined as follows. We transform the original constrained extremum problem into an unconstrained extremum problem of the associated gain function. This function contains as the variables vectors of both decision variables and parameters of the original problem. The unconstrained extremum conditions of the gain function with respect to the decision variables establish the Lagrangean method, while those with respect to the parameter vector yield the comnparative static formulae. Our method of derivation may be called the gain function method. In the present paper we will nowhere assume convexity, nor will we employ theories on convex sets and functions. The next section illustrates the gain function approach in the simplest possible situation by proving the Lagrangean method. Comparative static results are derived in Section 2. The Le Chatelier-Samuelson Principle is generalized in Section 3. The gain function method is applied to maximization problems with inequality constraints in Section 4. The final section presents economic applications of the results.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a987-997..htm,10.2307/2296928

It is the purpose of this note to explain why this qualification applies. This will serve not only to qualify an important piece of theoretical work, but also to exhibit a result which is of interest in its own right. The mistake Sweeney makes in analyzing price regulation is crucial, though quite understandable given the conventional view on the effect of a binding price constraint. As soon as he turns to the price regulation case, Sweeney states, "" We will assume the prices are limited to not exceed P(t), . . . and that this is a binding constraint. That is, the demand for the resource at any time is assumed to be greater than the quantity supplied, and the actual sales are limited by supply decisions . . .

Therefore, knowledge of these Aij is insufficient to characterize a cost function and, by duality, the underlying production function.

The basic model has an ex ante decision by suppliers, made with rational expectations, followed by a competitive exchange economy after the state of nature is known. The paper analyses the changes in expected utilities of demanders and suppliers from small changes in the ex ante decision away from the competitive equilibrium. Such changes generally have the potential of increasing the sum of expected utilities and can result in a Pareto improvement. The paper focuses on distinguishing between situations where the gain comes from stabilizing output across states of nature and those where the gain comes from destabilizing.

Luis Guasch', 'Andrew Weiss']","1980, vol. 47, issue 4, 653-664",[],"In most exchanges of labour services, there is substantial ignorance about the ability of individual workers. As long as a firm is not paying wholly on the basis of piece work, it has an incentive to learn the ability of its applicants, and the more able workers have an incentive to sort themselves from the less able. The most common means of sorting workers is through an examination, i.e. a questionnaire or an apprenticeship programme during which performance is monitored. The cost of an examination increases with its accuracy and precision and one would seldom expect a perfectly accurate and precise test to be used by firms. One way of increasing the effectiveness of a test is to impose penalties upon workers who receive low examination scores and rewards for those who receive high scores. Those who think it is likely that they will receive a high score are most likely to apply for the examination. Thus, the firm has converted a single examination into a two-part test; those who "" pass "" receive high scores not only on the firm examination, but also on their own self-appraisal. We show that when tests (apprenticeships) are used as self-selection devices, so that in effect workers are charged an application fee, a Nash equilibrium with free entry may not exist. When an equilibrium does exist, it is characterized by a wage distribution and workers who fail the test receive a net wage below their net marginal product, while those who pass the test receive a net wage above their net marginal product. The failures subsidize the successes. The application fee paid by a job applicant is an increasing function of his perceived productivity and is greater than the real testing costs incurred by the firm. These results do not depend upon any monopoly power of workers or firms nor upon the test being costly. However, they do depend upon the test being an imprecise measure of productivity. If the test score is a sufficient statistic of productivity, a Nash equilibrium always exists; workers who pass and who fail the test receive wages equal to their respective marginal product and the fee charged for taking the test is equal to the actual cost of administering the test. By introducing informational considerations and viewing low-wage training programmes as tests, we provide a new explanation for the positive correlation between wages and seniority. This increase in wages has been attributed to on-the-job training (see",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a653-664..htm,10.2307/2296934
2123,Review of Economic Studies,"Worker Cooperatives as Industrial Policy: the Case of the ""Scottish Daily News""","['Keith Bradley', 'Alan Gelb']","1980, vol. 47, issue 4, 665-678",[],"Arguments for state support of declining industries generally stress a need to maintain employment or slow down redundancy. The strongest political case for support is commonly made by firms whose factors see little immediate alternative demand for their services, hence possess low shadow wages. Greater long-run possibilities of factor reallocation cause political pressure to diverge from economic arguments, but it appears to be difficult for the latter to influence political payoffs and decisions. A sequence of politically "" optimal"" but myopic decisions may seriously worsen resource allocation: see e.g. Gelb (1977). Nevertheless, slow growth and low investment reduce the speed of economic restructuring in developed countries while capital and technology flows lead to the swift creation of manufacturing capacity in middle-income developing countries. International agreements limit selective interventions in product markets, while the increased power of organized labour and cushioning of the unemployed weaken traditional market mechanisms of factor reallocation. Given anything like the present political systems of most developed countries, the reconciliation of efficient long-run resource allocation with pressure for selective support of declining industries promises to be one of the most intractable problems of the 1980s: see, for example, World Bank (1978). Support methods must be developed which satisfy immediate pressures for cushioning, yet lead to minimal longerrun resource misallocation. In 1974 the Labour government founded three worker cooperatives: Meriden, Kirkby and the now defunct "" Scottish Daily News "" (SDN). The political furor over their merits has obscured the cooperatives' unique significance as testing grounds for an alternative pattern of employment-maintaining state support, temporary or permanent in nature. We here analyse the SDN financing method as industrial cushioning and suggest the reappraisal of attitudes to cooperativism, not necessarily on ideological grounds, but because of the method's potential, in certain circumstances, as a factor screening and project control mechanism, helping to reconcile short-run political pressure with longer-run economic efficiency without the need for difficult, costly direct monitoring. Worker control may be a useful managerial strategy for the state. The next section outlines salient points of the SDN cooperative. We then note three reasons why conventional support policies tend to lead to resource misallocation and indicate the advantages of the SDN intervention method.

2124,Review of Economic Studies,Expectations and the Dynamics of Devaluation,['Stephen J Turnovsky'],"1980, vol. 47, issue 4, 679-704",[],"The traditional treatments of devaluation consist of the elasticities and absorption approaches. The first of these focuses on the relative price effect and assigns a central role to the price elasticities of demand.1 By lowering the relative price of domestic goods, a devaluation will have an expansionary effect domestically, and provided the MarshallLerner condition holds, this will be accompanied by an improvement in the balance of trade (payments). The absorption approach on the other hand, emphasizes the relationship of real expenditure to real income and shows that a devaluation will improve the balance of trade if and only if it increases the difference between income and expenditure.2 Recently, an extensive literature has been evolving, reassessing these traditional effects. Most of this follows the so-called monetary approach to devaluation.3 This itself has several aspects. First, it emphasizes the role of real wealth. It is observed that given the stock of financial assets in nominal terms, a devaluation will lower real wealth, thereby lowering consumption demand, and providing an offsetting contractionary effect to the traditional relative price effect. Secondly, it pays particular attention to how the change in foreign reserves resulting from a devaluation will lead to a change in the domestic money supply, thereby creating a dynamic adjustment process. As a consequence it becomes necessary to distinguish between the short-run and long-run effects of a devaluation, rather than treating it statically, as in the traditional model. In this paper, we focus on one further aspect which has thus far been ignored in devaluation analysis, but which nevertheless is important. This concerns the role of expectations of the devaluation, which impinge on the economy through the domestic interest rate.4 Indeed, devaluations often take place precisely in economic circumstances in which it is not unreasonable for the public to anticipate their occurrence. To the extent this is so, expectations may generate an outflow of capital which at least in the short run may offset the desired effects of the devaluation. We shall analyze the influence of expectations on the effects of a devaluation by using a simple monetary model. There are two critical aspects to the expectation of the devaluation which need to be considered. One concerns the timing; the other the magnitude (and direction). Except for a few brief comments in Section 6 below, we assume that individuals forming these expectations have perfect information with respect to the precise date of the devaluation. In this case the devaluation will induce an impulse into the system, which we show will have an important impact on its dynamic adjustment. We assume that individuals may or may not have perfect information with respect to the magnitude of the devaluation; if they do, then this hypothesis corresponds to a world of perfect myopic foresight, extensively studied by economists in flexible exchange rate and other contexts. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we describe in formal terms the devaluation and the expectational hypothesis we are adopting. The following section discusses the implications of interest rate parity for the behaviour of the domestic bond price and interest rate in response to an anticipated movement in the exchange rate.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a679-704..htm,10.2307/2296936
2125,Review of Economic Studies,A Model of Stochastic Equilibrium in a Quasi-Competitive Industry,['John Sutton'],"1980, vol. 47, issue 4, 705-722",[],"Considerable attention has been devoted in recent years to the study of markets which are quasi-competitive in the sense that they retain the notion of a large number of firms selling a homogeneous product, but depart from perfect competition in relaxing the assumption that consumers are perfectly informed as to the prices of the various firms. The initial surge of interest in this type of model was motivated by the need, first noted by Arrow (1956), to deal with the firm, even in a competitive environment, as a price setter, in order adequately to tackle the analysis of disequilibrium behaviour. Thus early work in the field, beginning with Fisher ((1970), (1972), (1973)) focussed on the question of whether an initial market distribution of prices would, over time, converge to a unique equilibrium price. More recent work has, however, developed the idea that market equilibrium might be characterized by a persistent distribution of prices. That this is more reasonable in the light of "" the variety and volatility of prices (which is) the commonplace of our experience "" was argued by Rothschild (1973). A further, and theoretically more compelling, reason for exploring this question, however, is provided by what is probably the most striking aspect of the literature on these markets: the fact that for a very wide range of apparently quite reasonable assumptions, the distribution of prices converges to the monopoly price (Diamond (1971), Hey (1974)). Indeed, where prices do converge, they converge to the competitive price only under very strong conditions: for example, where firms are artificially constrained to behave as if they were perfect competitors (Fisher, Rothschild, op. cit.). Thus it would seem that in order to tackle the question of whether, under conditions of imperfect price information, any competitive features of the market may be preserved, we are compelled to examine market equilibria of this more general class. Such price dispersion as is empirically observed in many markets undoubtedly owes its origin to a wide range of contributory factors. This suggests representing the firm as experiencing a succession of exogenous random shocks, as in Lucas and Prescott (1974). An alternative approach is to explore the possibility that firms set a range of suboptimal prices via their various estimates of actual demand conditions, as deduced by following an optimal estimation procedure (stopping rule), as explored by Rothschild (1974). More germane to our present concerns as to whether the range of actual prices, or their average, might be drawn by competitive pressures below the monopoly price, is the more recent work which begins from the notion that consumers differ in their costs of acquiring information, so that firms partition themselves permanently into subgroups patronized predominantly by different mixtures of consumer types; the "" better informed consumers "" being associated, as it were, with the "" lower price firms "".

2126,Review of Economic Studies,Optimal Pricing to Retard Entry,['Steven A. Lippman'],"1980, vol. 47, issue 4, 723-731",[],"In analogy to the notion of delayed gratification, economists have long been aware that profit maximization entails taking account of the entire planning horizon with a mind to balance immediate profits against long term profits. As applied to the oligopolist, Bain (1949) noted that the threat of competition might cause established firms to sacrifice current profit in order to preclude entry and the concomitant competition. However, in defining the "" limit price "" as the highest price the established firms can set without inducing entry, it is clearly revealed that Bain viewed entry as a deterministic event. The first probabilistic approaches to the entry issue were suggested by Williamson (1963) and Stigler (1968) where it was noted that the probability of entry is an increasing function of the product price and that retarding rather than precluding entry is associated with the profit maximizing strategy. More recently, Kamien and Schwartz (1971), Baron (1973), Deshmukh and Chikte (1976), and Deshmukh and Winston (1979) have treated models with probabilistic entry. In the model presented here the industry is composed of (nearly) identical firms selling the same product and experiencing the same constant average cost of production, with industry demand divided amongst the established firms. A product price must be selected at each instant of time during the time horizon. Entry occurs according to a Poisson process with the arrival rate at any given point in time an increasing function of the product price at that time; thus, any number of firms can enter during the time horizon. The profit rate is a function of both the current product price and the current industry size. The crucial feature of this model as well as in those cited above is the fact that there is a dominant firm or price leader or, equivalently, the established firms (industry) act collectively as a cartel to maximize industry profits. Competition appears not within the industry but rather with potential entrants. The problem is to find the prices, termed optimal, that maximize the expected discounted value of the price leader's profits over the time horizon as a function of the industry size (which increases with the passage of time). Our model is nearly that of Deshmukh and Chitke (1976) and Deshmukh and Winston (1979). The fundamental difference between our model and Baron's discrete time model is that there the immediate profit is a function of the product price only if there is no entry during the period. The basic model is presented in Section 2, whereas the fundamental result, one not found elsewhere in the literature, regarding the nature of the optimal price as a function of the industry size is presented in Section 3. There we demonstrate that the optimal price increases with the number of firms in the industry and in the limit converges to the monopolistic price. That is, in the presence of a price leader, a decrease in industry concentration leads to an increase in the product price rather than to a more "" competitive "" price. Of course, this result depends upon the price leadership being maintained even as the industry grows. (See Telser (1972, Chapter 5) for a discussion of the problems associated with cartel maintenance.) When we allow the entry rate to be a decreasing function of the industry size as well as the price, we can show only that the optimal price converges to the",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a723-731..htm,10.2307/2296938
2127,Review of Economic Studies,Vertical and Horizontal Communication in Economic Processes,['Robert L. Welch'],"1980, vol. 47, issue 4, 733-746",[],"Two fundamentally different concepts of communication have appeared in the literature on economic adjustment processes. One is vertical communication (vc) in which all agents send messages to and receive messages from a central agent often called the auctioneer, helmsman or central planner. Typically, there is a considerable amount of common information available, usually in the form of prices which all agents observe. Often there is some central coordination of actions. An agent has little direct contact with agents other than the central agent. Examples are the tatonnement model of market adjustment (Arrow and Hurwicz (1959)) and models of decentralized planning (Arrow and Hurwicz (1960), Heal (1969) and Malinvaud (1967)). The second concept is horizontal communication (hc) in which all message exchange occurs through direct contact between agents. There is no one agent involved in every message exchange as in vertical communication. There is little common information and no central coordination of actions. Examples are models of general equilibrium under search behaviour (Diamond (1971), Fisher (1973) and Mortensen (1973)) and models of sequential trading (Feldman (1973)). In this paper we compare the value of information generated by some frequently used examples of vertical and horizontal communication. We adopt Marshak and Radner's model of a team in which conflict is absent in order to concentrate on the informational aspects of communication. The apparent need for common information and central coordination when organization-wide constraints are present suggests that vertical communication processes should perform better than horizontal communication. Our principle result is that, for truncated adjustment processes, limited horizontal communication may be more effective than limited vertical communication even when there is a team-wide constraint to satisfy. However, for large teams, hc can be no more effective than vc. These conclusions are the result of an analysis of specific examples of a team resource allocation model introduced by Groves and Radner (1972) and Radner (1972). Our examples also demonstrate that in order to satisfy resource constraints in a teamdecision model, it is not necessary either to have one agent control all decisions entering the constraint (as in quantity planning) or restrict a member's actions entering the constraint to depend only on events which all members can observe (as in planning by pricing). Many procedures, such as tatonnement, decentralized planning and bilateral exchange have been designed to compute optimal solutions to the problem of allocation resources within an organization. These procedures consist of an iterative exchange of messages between agents such that the messages converge to some value. This equilibrium message is then translated by an outcome function into actions which are optimal. Because of the costs involved in communication, such procedures will, in practice, be truncated before the equilibrium message is known. If a process is truncated, the outcome rule applied to the current messages may not provide feasible actions.- In tatonnement, for example, positive",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a733-746..htm,10.2307/2296939

The implications of the incentive effect have been studied by examining optimal tax structures under a variety of assumptions about preferences, the distribution of wage rates, and the form of the social welfare function. Much of this work has been done using models that include interpersonal variation in "" ability"" (wage rates), but in which no saving or dissaving occurs, i.e. in which the consumption of each individual is exactly equal to his labour income net of taxes within the time period (Mirrlees (1971), Sheshinski (1972a), (1972b), Atkinson (1973a), (1973b), Phelps (1973), Cooter and Helpman (1974), Itsumi (1974), Sadka (1976)). While the latter assumption might be innocuous if wage rates were approximately constant over an individual's lifetime, so that there was little incentive to borrow or save, or if capital markets were non-existent, so that borrowing and saving were impossible, wage profiles are in fact quite steep and most individuals make use of (admittedly imperfect) capital markets. Multiperiod models incorporating consumption-saving decisions have been used to study the effects on capital accumulation of wage, interest, capital gains, and other taxes, but even those models that include variation in "" ability"" have in general assumed that labour is supplied at a constant rate over the individual's working years (Ordover and Phelps (1975), Sheshinski (1976), Feldstein (1974)). A life-cycle model of individual behaviour that includes both labour supply and consumption decisions is used below. Although a general equilibrium framework is used, for simplicity real capital is ignored; labour is the only factor of production and government debt is the only asset available to savers. Only steady states and only linear tax schedules are considered, and the utilitarian social welfare function is used throughout. First, the conditions under which the life-cycle model reduces to the one-period case are derived, as well as the conditions under which the first-best tax policies for the two are identical. Next it is shown that if all individuals are identical, the optimal policy consists of lump-sum taxes together with an interest rate equal to the rate of pure time preference. The non-optimality of the "" biological interest rate "" proposed by Samuelson (1958) in his "" Exact Consumption-Loan Model "" is discussed. Finally, an upper bound on the optimal marginal tax rate is derived. This bound depends on the elasticity of total labour supply and on the elasticity of demand for debt.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a777-785..htm,10.2307/2296943

Arrow and his successors dropped the continuity requirement and demanded instead that the social ordering vary in a natural way with individual preferences. These requirements, the independence of irrelevant alternatives and citizen sovereignty axioms, together with the requirement that the social preference relation satisfy transitivity or some weaker rationality condition, imply either that power is concentrated to an extreme extent or that the social choice process is indecisive. In this paper we eliminate the transitivity assumption employed in the Bergson-Samuelson formulation and instead concentrate on the axiom that the social preference relation be continuous. Specifically, we examine the nature of a function that maps each n-tuple of individual preferences into a continuous binary relation that does not necessarily satisfy any rationality condition. When this function depends in a ""natural"" way on individual preferences, we show that power, although not necessarily concentrated, is distributed in a dichotomous fashion among individuals; each coalition can either determine the social preference relation on every pair of alternatives or on no pair of alternatives. Furthermore, any alternative x will be socially preferred to an alternative y only if those who prefer x to y constitute one of the powerful coalitions.

He also shows that creation of a monetary asset may restore efficiency of the equilibrium. In this paper, we will investigate this class of economies more fully, focusing upon the relationship between Pareto efficiency and lumpsum (taxes and) transfers. We consider a consumption-loan type economy where each generation lives for a finite number of periods but generations overlap each other and the economy continues without interruption. Following the original Samuelson paper (1958), we assume that all consumption goods are completely perishable and that there is no production. However, we assume that all consumers in this economy can borrow from each other. In this sense, all consumers are capable of issuing IOU's or inside money. Despite the existence of inside money, the economy may still be unable to achieve a Pareto efficient allocation as an Arrow-Debreu competitive equilibrium, i.e. a competitive equilibrium with perfect foresight. This anomaly arises because of a particular feature of the consumption-loan type formulation, namely a double infinity of time and agents (Shell (1971)). In particular, it requires an introduction of paper assets in order to achieve a Pareto efficient equilibrium allocation. With this paper asset (which is not an obligation for any consumer in the economy and therefore which may be called outside money) the economy may be able to borrow from the infinite future and to make everyone in the economy better off. The purpose of this paper is twofold. In the first half of the paper, we shall extend the well-known fundamental theorem of welfare economics. We shall show that any Pareto efficient allocation can be achieved as a compensated equilibrium by a suitable choice of lump-sum (taxes and) transfers (either in the form of commodity transfers or in the form of paper asset transfers). This result, however, is fundamentally different from the well-known result in the finite horizon case. If the horizon is finite, the lump-sum transfers, even in the form of paper assets, must cancel out in aggregate. In other words, the government budget must balance. However, in the consumption-loan type models,",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a797-807..htm,10.2307/2296945

2137,Review of Economic Studies,Cournot Equilibrium with Free Entry,['William Novshek'],"1980, vol. 47, issue 3, 473-486",[],"Despite the fact that the assumptions underlying perfect competition never actually hold, the use of the competitive model, as an idealization, is justified if the predictions of the model approximate the outcomes of situations it is used to represent. In partial equilibrium analysis, this justification is embodied in the "" Folk Theorem "" which states that if firms are small relative to the market, then the market outcome is approximately competitive. This paper provides a precise statement and proof of the "" Folk Theorem "" for competitive markets with a single homogeneous good, and free entry and exit. It is shown that if firms are small relative to the market then there is a Cournot equilibrium with free entry; furthermore, any Cournot equilibrium with free entry is approximately competitive. More specifically, if we consider an appropriate sequence of markets in which firms become arbitrarily small relative to the market, then there is a Cournot equilibrium with free entry for all markets in the tail of the sequence, and aggregate equilibrium output converges to perfectly competitive output. If firms have strictly U-shaped average cost curves, then individual firm behaviour converges to competitive behaviour. The treatment of free entry distinguishes this paper from other papers dealing with the "" Folk Theorem "", where either the number of firms is exogeneous, ruling out free entry, or free entry is treated as being equivalent to a zero profit condition, ignoring the integer problem that arises when the number of firms is finite but unspecified. Firms may become small relative to the market in two ways: through changes in technology, absolute firm size (the smallest output at which minimum average cost is attained) may become small, or, through shifts in demand, the absolute size of the market (the market demand at competitive price) may become large. We allow both types of changes here, though shifts in demand, especially in the form of replication of the consumer sector, may be more familiar. In his conclusion, Ruffin (1971) presents a verbal argument for the "" Folk Theorem "" which is based on replication of demand and entry. Hart (1979), though not concerned with existence, shows that in a general equilibrium model with differentiated products and free entry, equilibria are approximately competitive (Pareto optimal) when consumers have been replicated a sufficient number of times. The paper is organized as follows: Section 1 contains the perfectly competitive model and its assumptions, Section 2 contains the assumptions and definitions for the imperfectly competitive model, Section 3 contains an example contrasting the usual treatment of the "" Folk Theorem"" and the present approach, Section 4 contains the proofs of the main results, and Section 5 contains remarks on the results and indicates how some of the assumptions that are used can be weakened.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a473-486..htm,10.2307/2297299

The consumer owns a non-interest-bearing asset, called "" money"" and cannot buy the consumption good without paying money for it. An important assumption of the model is that, by the time he makes his decision for a given period, the agent knows whether he is employed or not in that period. Therefore, the consumption decision depends not only on the initial money holding of the consumer but also on his current employment situation. In Section 7 of their paper, Foley and Hellwig introduced firms to study the behaviour of market aggregates. The firms and the consumers are treated symmetrically. Therefore, the firms "" make production decisions under certainty about effective demand by workers who, on their side, are supposed to know already whether they are employed or not "" (footnote 1, page 340). One way to remedy this problem is explicitly to introduce a dynamic structure by assuming that in each period the labour market opens first. It implies that the firms have to make employment decisions before knowing what their current sales will be. Therefore, they face a problem of liquidity: their labour demand is constrained by the quantity of money they initially hold. Furthermore, the distribution of profits cannot be exogenous: the firms must be able to decide upon the dividends to pay to the shareholders. It is the purpose of the present paper to provide a simple model of a firm which decides upon an employment level and a dividend payment facing a sequence of sale-no sale contingencies. Section 2 of the paper is devoted to the presentation of the model. Properties of the optimal policy are discussed in Section 3, while Section 4 deals with the asymptotic behaviour of the model.

Waugh and subsequent investigators (e.g. Massell (1969), Turnovsky (1976) and Bradford and Kelejian (1977)) use this result to derive propositions on the welfare and distributional effects of price stabilization schemes.' This approach ignores the uncertainty in real income generated by price variability. It also fails to consider the role of hedging against price variation through appropriate portfolio diversification. In this paper demand theory is used to show that relative price variability has an ambiguous effect on expected utility when only a single asset is available as a store of value. A positive effect is more likely when the demand elasticity is large relative to the degree of relative risk aversion and when the marginal propensity to consume the commodity in question is large. When there exists a futures market for each commodity, the consumer can hedge against price variation to insure a positive effect. Increased variance in a log-normally distributed price unambiguously raises expected utility when the consumer hedges optimally. A second purpose of this paper is to explore the implications of price variability for optimal savings as well as for expected utility. While the effects of uncertainty in the value of future endowments and assets on optimal savings have been explored extensively scant attention has been paid to the effects of relative price uncertainty.2 The present paper attempts to fill this gap for the case in which utility is intertemporally additively separable. Section 2 presents a general framework for analysing expected utility maximization in a two-period, multi-commodity, multi-asset environment in wh;-"" prices and income in the second period are stochastic. Section 3 analyses the effect on expected utility of increased variability in the relative price of a single commodity in a two-commodity context.

2143,Review of Economic Studies,Optimal Claims in Automobile Insurance,"['Itzhak Venezia', 'Haim Levy']","1980, vol. 47, issue 3, 539-549",[],"In this paper we explore the optimal strategy of claiming damages in automobile insurance. In most countries, the insurance premiums which the insured must pay, increase whenever he files a claim. Thus the insured must weigh the benefits from being paid the damages against the added costs of paying higher insurance rates in the future. As a result the insured will file a claim only when the damage is higher than some critical value. Since the decision of the insured (to claim or not to claim) affect his state in the future (higher insurance rates or lower insurance rates), one needs to solve a dynamic programming problem to obtain the optimal strategy of claiming insurance. Several authors have investigated this problem (see, e.g. Lemaire (1976, 1977), Norberg (1976)). These authors however derived the optimal policy under the assumption that the insured (or decision maker) is risk neutral. Here we obtain the optimal claims strategy for a risk-averse decision maker, and analyse the economic properties of the optimal solution. In Section 2 we present our model and provide a method for computing the optimal claims strategy. In Section 3 we investigate the effect of increased risk on the claims strategy of the decision maker and on his welfare. This effect however, depends on the chosen measure of increasing risk. We have used two alternative measures: Rothschild and Stiglitz' (1970) and Diamond and Stiglitz' (1974). It is shown that increased risk (by Rothschild and Stiglitz' measure) increases the welfare of a risk-neutral decision maker. An economic explanation for this (unexpected) result is provided. It is also shown that if the risk-neutral decision maker is in the next to higher premium rate, his critical value rises with increased risk. The conclusions drawn for risk-neutral decision makers hold true for risk-averse decision makers if the decision maker exhibits decreasing (Arrow/Pratt) risk aversion and one employs Diamond and Stiglitz (DS) measure of increasing risk. However, if Rothschild and Stiglitz (RS) measure is employed, the effect of increasing risk on the decision maker cannot be predicted. A heuristic interpretation to this result is also provided. In Section 4 we explore the effect of an increase in current (or transitory) income and the effect of an increase in permanent income (or wealth) on the optimal claims strategy. It is shown that an increase in current income tends to increase the critical values, whereas the effect of wealth cannot be predicted.

2144,Review of Economic Studies,On Hartwick's Rule for Regular Maximin Paths of Capital Accumulation and Resource Depletion,"['Avinash Dixit', 'Peter Hammond', 'Michael Hoel']","1980, vol. 47, issue 3, 551-556",[],"In a series of recent papers, Hartwick (1977a, b, c, 1978b, c) has shown in a number of special models that keeping investment equal to the rents (really profits from the flow of depletion) from exhaustible resources under competitive pricing yields a path of constant consumption. We shall call this the "" Hartwick Rule "". Our purpose is to examine this striking rule in a general context. We shall allow many types of consumption goods and endogenous labour supplies. We shall also allow heterogeneous capital goods, and treat exhaustible or renewable resources as special capital goods: exhaustible resources can be depleted but not produced, renewable ones can also be produced. One restriction we impose is that there is no population growth or technical progress. Hartwick (1977b) does allow these, but as they require a fortuitous coincidence of different exogenous rates if the rule is to remain valid, we do not think it worthwhile to attempt that generalization. In our general framework the Hartwick rule becomes "" keep the total value of net investment under competitive pricing equal to zero "". This is then shown to be sufficient to give a constant utility path. The desirability of such a simple unified treatment should be evident. It even proves possible to generalize the rule to "" keep the present discounted value of total net investment under competitive pricing constant over time ""; indeed, the generalized Hartwick rule is necessary and sufficient for constant utility. More importantly, while these rules give intergenerational equality, it remains to be seen whether they yield the best paths of this kind, i.e. Rawlsian paths. We therefore show that the generalized Hartwick rule is sufficient to give a constant utility maximin path, or a little more precisely, a "" regular "" maximin path as defined in Burmeister and Hammond (1977), provided that there is free disposal and an absence of "" stock reversal "", as explained in Section 4.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a551-556..htm,10.2307/2297306

Given that for many individuals the discounted present value of expected pension rights is one of the most important components of personal wealth it would seem desirable to include an estimate of the former in any measure of the latter. This will require the discounting of anticipated future payments and receipts at an appropriate rate. In the absence of uncertainty and with perfect capital markets anticipated future payments and receipts would be discounted at the prevailing rate of interest on financial assets. Where the individual's lifetime is of uncertain length but there exist perfect insurance markets of the type considered by Yaari (1965) the appropriate rate of discount would be the actuarially fair rate of interest prevailing on insurance notes. Now whilst the individual is uncertain as to how long he will live it is not the case that individuals are observed trading in actuarially fair insurance notes as suggested by the Yaari model. The aim of this paper is to try and obtain some insight into the appropriate rate of discount to be used in the valuation of pension wealth when insurance markets are less perfect than those described by Yaari.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a587-593..htm,10.2307/2297309

In particular, in general there will be no symmetry restrictions of the type derived by Slutsky (1915) for a system of demand functions generated by a single utility maximizing consumer. This paper is concerned with the econometric implications of these results. In particular, we look for assumptions on either tastes or the distribution of income which will allow us to utilize the Slutsky symmetry conditions in the econometric estimation of market demand equations. In Section 2 we postulate that every consumer has the same preferences, and individual incomes can differ arbitrarily, while in Section 3 we allow for some variations in individual preferences, but the distribution of income is restricted.

2149,Review of Economic Studies,On the Possibility of Consistent Voting Procedures,['Bhaskar Dutta'],"1980, vol. 47, issue 3, 603-616",[],"Recent literature on strategic voting discusses several distinct, though related questions. Initially, attempts were made to see whether one could construct reasonable group decision procedures under which every possible sincere voting situation would constitute an equilibrium (see Farquharson (1969), Murakami (1968), Gibbard (1973), Pattanaik (1973, 1974, 1975, 1976a, b, 1978), Satterthwaite (1975)). Various writers have also commented on the significance of collective rationality and other well-known conditions of Arrow in the context of strategic voting (see Gibbard (1973), Satterthwaite (1975), Pattanaik (1978)). The general conclusion that emerges from this considerable volume of work is that under all reasonable group decision procedures, some sincere preference profile will not constitute an equilibrium. A somewhat different line of enquiry was pioneered by Peleg (1978), who introduced the notion of consistent decision procedures under which there will be at least one equilibrium for every possible sincere profile. Clearly, this represents a considerable weakening of the concept of strategy-proofness, which requires the sincere situation itself to be an equilibrium. This paper is concerned with the second class of problems mentioned above. First, we show that if all individuals' sincere preferences are linear orderings,' then a situation constitutes an equilibrium only if the choice set is a subset of the choice set corresponding to the sincere preference profile. This constitutes an important motivation for consistency. The result guarantees that under a wide class of consistent decision procedures, the set of outcomes corresponding to any equilibrium situation will not contain any outcome which is judged non-optimal according to the sincere preference profile. At most, some outcome which is optimal according to the sincere preference profile is now judged non-optimal.2 Secondly, we establish a connection between the number of alternatives in the issue, the size of winning coalitions and consistency. It turns out that acyclicity is a necessary condition for consistency. We also prove the existence of a class of consistent decision procedures. Lastly, we show that a necessary and sufficient condition for consistent voting schemes,3 is that individuals' sincere preferences be Value-Restricted.4 An example is given to show that Value-Restriction is not sufficient for the sincere-preference profile to be an equilibrium. These results establish the fact that consistency constitutes more than a formal weakening of sincere preference equilibrium. The results also suggest that consistency may be viewed as an "" ethically "" suitable substitute for true preference revelation.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a603-616..htm,10.2307/2297311

We take our cue from one of the author's previous papers (1976). The argument below improves upon Campbell (1976)-and, we would like to claim, upon rival procedures for generating non-empty choice sets-in several respects. First, the social choice functions are structured, not by an appeal to rationality desiderata, which are especially difficult to evaluate in the context of social choice, but by recognizing the value of the time taken to locate a member of the choice set.1 Second, majority rule is not assumed as the base relation used to generate choice sets; it is derived and the normative conditions employed are rather mild, certainly when compared to May (1952). Third, we investigate the decisiveness of the admissible social choice functions. Fourth, we give an argument very similar to the one of Kalai et al. (1976) defending our social choice functions in terms of incentive compatibility. Section 1 lays out the basic definitions and notation. Sections 2 and 3 consider the normative and computational aspects of social choice. The results are stated and discussed in Section 4; the proofs are relegated to an appendix.

2151,Review of Economic Studies,"A Note on Soviet Pricing, Profits and Technological Choice","['Morgan Åberg', 'Håkan Persson']","1980, vol. 47, issue 3, 629-635",[],"In an article, "" Soviet Pricing, Profits and Technological Choice "", Manove (1976) has shown that it is not always necessary to use scarcity prices in order to bring about productive efficiency in a planned economy. Prices based on average production costs can equally well be used in finding a cost minimizing technology. In proving these propositions Manove uses a model with one primary factor of production and technologies defined as convex combinations of linear techniques. One question is whether these conclusions will hold in a more general setting, e.g. as in that of Lange (1938). In Manove's model, prices are set equal to simultaneously determined production costs, given some average technology. Prices may thus be regarded as balanced or equilibrium prices for this technology. At those prices, the profitability of different techniques determine changes in production shares of different techniques in such a way that the production share is increased for at least one technique showing positive profit. Once this change has been made, the new average technology and the corresponding prices are determined. These calculations continue until an optimal technology is reached. In this note we shall provide weaker conditions for price procedures which will also lead to a choice of optimal technology. When techniques are selected, prices need not be equilibrium prices of the average technology at each instance. Further, price revisions are simpler to accomplish; no simultaneous determination of prices is required and the change of the price of a commodity is based solely on the profits of that industry. Hence, there is no need for balanced prices in the search for an optimal technology. Taken as a description of a planned economy, each individual technique represents one enterprise. The Central Planning Authority, CPA, has set production targets for each commodity. During the execution of the plan, the CPA determines production shares of individual enterprises and makes revisions of prices. In Manove's model the CPA collects information on average technologies and calculates average production costs of every industry. In our case, the CPA or industries only use profits to determine prices. Hence, the information exchange between different levels of the economy is smaller in our formulation. Further, with a huge number of commodities it may be unrealistic to assume that simultaneously determined production costs can ever, or often enough, be calculated.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a629-635..htm,10.2307/2297313

Laffont and Garcia (1974) in their analysis of the market for business loans and Portes and Winter (1980) in their model of the consumption sector in centrally planned economies report for each sample point the probability that the point was from one of the regimes. Rosen and Quandt (1978) also try to identify periods of excess demand in a disequilibrium model of the US labour market. The purpose of this note is to point out that the classification method used to date, conditional on the estimated parameters, is not efficient and that the probabilities obtained by this method are not the appropriate probabilities to report. Looking at the disequilibrium model as giving a joint distribution of the dependent variable q and a binary variable D indicating the regime (see below), shows that reported probabilities have been based on the marginal distribution of D, which is appropriate for prediction rather than the distribution conditional on q, which is appropriate for classification.

2153,Review of Economic Studies,Uzawa's Preference Axioms: A Comment,['S. Fuchs-Seliger'],"1980, vol. 47, issue 3, 641-644",[],"Much attention in the theory of revealed preference has been devoted to the problem of demand functions generated from continuous utility functions. First Samuelson (1938), the originator of the theory of revealed preference, presented assumptions for P2+. Later Houthakker (1950) developed this model of consumer's behaviour for the n-dimensional case. A gap in Houthakker's proof has been recently closed by B. Stigum (1973). Uzawa (1960) presented a different version of Houthakker's theorem. His conditions AI-AIV and the Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference establish the existence of an upper semicontinuous utility function generating the given demand function. Uzawa's query whether these conditions guarantee the existence of a continuous utility function was answered in the negative by a counterexample of Hurwicz and Richter (1971). At approximately the same time E. Gordon (1971) published an article in the Review of Economic Studies where he tried to demonstrate that the axioms AI-AIV and the Strong Axiom do imply the existence of a continuous utility function. Unfortunately the proof of his Proposition 3 (p. 327) contains an error which led to this wrong conclusion. The purpose of this paper is to correct Gordon's theorem by adding conditions which are essentially due to Stigum. We will see that supporting hyperplanes play an important part in the method of the proof. The correction of Gordon's proof, based on results of Uzawa, turns out to be another method to prove Houthakker's theorem.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a641-644..htm,10.2307/2297315

This model is widely used by economists; partly for theoretical reasons1 but largely for properties it possesses which are convenient for econometric work.2 In the field of inflation-rate expectations there is also some empirical support. This has been obtained by estimating the model on expectations data collected through sample surveys.3 Such work has also revealed two possible limitations of the model, and it is these possible limitations which provide the major motivation of this paper. First the empirical results seem to contradict the explicit assumption that the adjustment coefficient, A, remains constant throughout. In fact the evidence suggests that A increases in times of accelerating inflation and general uncertainty.4 The second problem is that when the inflation-rate is accelerating, the model is certain to produce inaccurate forecasts.5 Empirical work has revealed that higher order error-learning mechanisms are better at explaining the data for such periods.6 In Sections 2-5 a modified adaptive expectations model is developed which is consistent with the empirical evidence. It is found, in Sections 2 and 3 that by introducing certain realistic elements of uncertainty, an adaptive model with a time-varying coefficient is the result. The model is subsequently extended in Section 4 to allow expectations to be formed of the incremental growth rate of inflation. Finally in Section 6 an expectations series derived from the model, is used as an explanatory variable in an econometric analysis of personal savings behaviour.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a305-320..htm,10.2307/2296994

2158,Review of Economic Studies,A Structured Logit Model of Auto Ownership and Mode Choice,['Kenneth Train'],"1980, vol. 47, issue 2, 357-370",[],"For analysis of many transportation-related policies, it is useful to know the change which a particular policy would induce in the number of autos owned by households and the number of workers who take transit and auto to work. Models of households' choices of how many autos to own (called the auto ownership choice) and workers' choices of mode (called the work-trip mode choice) are intended to provide information about the effects of various policies. This information can be used, along with other information and ideas, in deciding which policies should be implemented. Previous studies of auto ownership and work-trip mode choices have generally been deficient in important ways.' First, most research has not confronted the simultaneity of the choices. Except for Lerman and Ben-Akiva (1975), past researchers have modelled either the auto ownership choice or the work-trip mode choice, not both. When modelling one of the choices, the simultaneity with the other choice has not been satisfactorily incorporated. Of the auto ownership models, Wharton (1977) included an explanatory variable defined as the number of autos the household uses for work trips, but did not adjust its estimation techniques to account for the endogeneity of this variable. None of the other auto ownership models included any variables relating to work-trip mode. In the work-trip mode-choice studies, more emphasis has been placed on the simultaneity of mode choice and auto ownership, but the results have been similarly unsatisfactory. Warner (1962), Lisco (1967), and Quarmby (1967) included auto ownership variables in their models with the (implicit) assumption that the number of autos is exogenous to the mode choice. On the other hand, Lave (1969) recognized that auto ownership is endogeneous and did not include an auto ownership variable on the grounds that his model formulation is a reduced-form equation. Train (1976b) used both approaches, estimating mode choice models with and without an auto ownership variable, and noted the problems inherent in each specification. Aside from the simultaneity problem, previous models have limited usefulness because they include only a few explanatory variables. This fact limits the number of policies and scenarios which can be analysed with the models. For example, in most mode choice models the time spent out of the vehicle (walking, waiting for a bus, and so on) is included as an explanatory variable. Since out-of-vehicle time is not decomposed into time spent waiting for transit and time spent walking to and from transit, the effect of policies trading off these two components cannot be analysed. (An example of such a policy is to place more buses on fewer bus lines, thus decreasing wait times and increasing walk times.) Analogously, most auto ownership models ignore the effect of family structure (household size and number of children, for example) on auto ownership decisions.2 The present study confronts these problems in the previous research. Models of mode choice and auto ownership are developed and estimated with explicit account taken of the interaction between the choices. Numerous explanatory variables are included so that a variety of policies and scenarios can be examined with the models.

2163,Review of Economic Studies,Interpersonal Comparability and Social Choice Theory,['Kevin Roberts'],"1980, vol. 47, issue 2, 421-439",[],"At a general level, the information that may be required to enable a planner to judge which of two states is socially preferable may be of a diverse character. It is convenient to partition this information into the welfare and non-welfare characteristics of social states. Welfare characteristics consist of the individual welfares achieved in different states; minimally, individual welfares will be ordinal and interpersonally non-comparable, but it is possible to consider situations where information about the cardinality and/or interpersonal comparability of welfares is also relevant. Non-welfare characteristics are more difficult to describe; as well as a physical description of a particular state, they may also be a description of the evolution of a state. Thus, for example, non-welfare characteristics may include information about whether claims bestowed in the past are settled in the state under consideration. In the language of social choice theory, if welfare characteristics are not always deemed relevant then the SWF (the rule for moving from characteristics to an ordering of social states) is said to be imposed, and if non-welfare characteristics are not deemed relevant then the SWF is said to be neutral. Social choice theory is conventionally concerned with nonimposed SWFs; although rarely mentioned, much of it also deals with non-neutral SWFs. For instance, in the problem studied by Arrow (1963), neutrality is not invoked and it does not follow from the axioms that he lays down. Arrow showed that there exists a dictator but, when this dictator is indifferent between two states, it is possible that non-welfare characteristics of the states will determine the social ordering. On the other hand, Arrow took welfares to be ordinal and non-comparable so that a considerable amount of information about welfares was deemed irrelevant, given that such information might be available. In a series of recent papers, the implications of allowing information concerned with the cardinal and comparable nature of welfares to influence the social ordering have been considered. Most of these studies have dealt with the characterization of either utilitarianism (d'Aspremont and Gevers (1977), Deschamps and Gevers (1978), Maskin (1978)) or the lexicographic extension to the Rawlsian maximin criterion (leximin) (Hammond (1976a), Sen (1976) and (1977), Strasnick (1976), d'Aspremont and Gevers (1977), Deschamps and Gevers (1978), Gevers (1979)). As these rules are neutral, conditions must be invoked which ensure the neutrality of the derived social ordering. This paper considers the derivation of non-imposed and non-neutral social orderings when individual welfares satisfy various measurability/comparability assumptions. The axioms used by Arrow are modified so as to admit the influence of different types of information. Section 2 deals with the formulation of the problem and there is a discussion of the various assumptions that can be made about the measurability/comparability of welfares. Section 3 considers the influence that non-welfare characteristics can have upon the social ordering. Further, a procedure is developed which allows permissible rules to be",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a421-439..htm,10.2307/2297002

2168,Review of Economic Studies,Models with Several Regimes and Changes in Exogeneity,['Jean-Francois Richard'],"1980, vol. 47, issue 1, 1-20",[],"In recent years, increasing attention has been devoted to models with a finite (usually small) number of regimes. Various strategies have been discussed in the literature to handle situations where each regime is characterized by a different value of a common parameter vector. See e.g. Barten and Bronsard (1970), Goldfeld and Quandt (1973), Poirier (1976),... . It appears however that no satisfactory treatment has yet been given to cases where the partitioning between "" endogenous "" and "" exogenous "" variables changes over time. Our objective is therefore to define a class of models with several regimes which is flexible enough to cover such situations. For convenience, we shall illustrate our argument by reference to an economy which is ""controlled "" by a policy maker shifting between instruments at some, possibly unknown, points of time. For tractability we shall mainly restrict our attention to a class of dynamic linear models although the concepts we introduce apply in a much broader framework. The possibility that the switching times could be endogenous to the model, such as in disequilibrium models will not be investigated here: work in progress indicates however that our approach can be extended in such directions. The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we shall discuss at length the issues to be faced by means of a simple example, taken from Goldfeld and Quandt (1973). In Section 3 we shall introduce the concepts which are needed for our analysis; linear dynamic models, LIML estimation and exogeneity. In Section 4, we shall discuss models with several regimes and concentrate in particular on imposing appropriate restrictions on the parameters characterizing different regimes. It will be shown that it is possible to preserve some of the operational features of LIML procedures.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a1-20..htm,10.2307/2297101

Furthermore, a number of studies of the forecasting performance of econometric models vis a' vis that of time series models (e.g. Naylor etal (1972) and further references in Prothero and Wallis (1977)) have been interpreted as demonstrating the superiority of time series model building methodology over that of econometrics. To the extent that econometric models have been based on static economic theory, with dynamics possibly introduced via serially correlated error processes, or have been in the mould of simple models involving first order dynamics such as the partial adjustment and adaptive expectations models, the implied criticism of econometric modelling is probably valid. However, econometricians need not restrict the range of models and techniques in this way, for they are fortunate in being able to combine structural information from economic theory, (especially for long-run equilibrium or steady-state behaviour), with the techniques of time series analysis and those of econometrics. We believe that the econometrician's search for an acceptable representation of the process generating the data being analysed is made easier by the use of both economic theory and the methods of time series analysis, and that the latter are complementary to econometric methods rather than substitutes for them. Rather than abandoning an econometric approach to modelling altogether and using "" black-box "" time series methods, we favour an approach which uses reasonable statistical procedures to test various hypotheses (which are too often arbitrarily selected and assumed to be valid), contained within a general unrestricted model, and then incorporates this evidence in a model whose structure is suggested by general economic considerations, to obtain an",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a21-45..htm,10.2307/2297102

2171,Review of Economic Studies,Discontinuous Budget Constraints and Estimation: The Demand for Housing,"['Jerry A. Hausman', 'David A. Wise']","1980, vol. 47, issue 1, 75-96",[],"Individual choices are often characterized by economists as resulting from maximization of an implicit utility function subject to a budget constraint. Informal graphical descriptions of the outcome of this process usually presume that the budget constraint, determined by individual income and prices, is linear-that the price of a good is independent of the amount of it that is purchased, and that income is independent of the amount purchased. But governmental regulations in particular-as well as non-governmental practices-often produce non-linear, kinked, and even discontinuous budget constraints. The relationship between hours worked and income, for example, would be linear if the wage rate didn't depend on hours worked. But, because of the progressive federal income tax structure, individuals actually face a net marginal wage rate that declines with income. The budget constraint is non-linear. Negative income tax plans often prescribe one tax rate up to a so-called "" breakeven "" point, and another thereafter. There is a kink at the breakeven point.1 Social security regulations impose low tax rates on wage income up to a given level and a very high tax rate on each additional dollar of income. Most existing health insurance plans, as well as proposed national health insurance schemes, include some combination of a deductible, a coinsurance rate, and possibly a maximum health care expenditure level. The price of a dollar's worth of health care is one up to the amount of the deductible; it is the coinsurance rate between the amount of the deductible and the maximum expenditure, and is zero thereafter. Again, the implied budget constraint is non-linear; it has ""kinks"" in it. Some proposed housing subsidy schemes stipulate that low income families receive "" housing"" payments, but only after a minimum expenditure for housing. The implied budget constraint is discontinuous. This paper proposes a rather general method of estimation when the implicit budget constraint is non-linear. But it does so by addressing a particular problem-the analysis of data generated by treatments in the recent Housing Demand Experiment, that can be thought of as creating discontinuous individual budget constraints. It rests on the assumption that the relative value that individuals attach to purchased goods can be described by a functional relationship that assigns weights to goods, or to the dollar expenditures for these goods, a "" utility "" function. The key parameters of this function are ""taste"" parameters that are assumed to depend on individual characteristics of decision makers and to be random, given measured characteristics. That is, they depend on observed as well as unobserved attributes of individuals or of their environment. In addition, we assume that persons are not always able to match expenditures to hypothetical best, or maximizing, values. Although the approach is motivated by the idea of utility",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a75-96..htm,10.2307/2297104
2172,Review of Economic Studies,A Model of Wage-Price Inflation,['J. Sargan'],"1980, vol. 47, issue 1, 97-112",[],"This paper reports the results of estimating a simple three equation model of wage-price inflation, where the endogenous variables to be explained have been taken to be the index of retail prices, the index of weekly wage rates, and the official average earnings index. These three variables were chosen to be explained together, firstly to avoid the choice as to whether the wage rates index or the average earnings variable should represent the labour cost variable, and secondly to allow the alternatives of using hourly wage rates, weekly wage rates, and the appropriately adjusted average earnings for the various exogenous variables (such as overtime working) to be resolved empirically. The price equation has been fully discussed already in a previous paper (1976) and will only briefly be discussed here. The wage and earnings equations were estimated by OLS, 2SLS and FIML methods using an eclectic approach to previous explanations of these variables. The form of the model estimated here is a development of that used by Espasa (1973), but also explores some hypotheses suggested by Johnston and Timbrell (1973) and Parkin etal (1976). In the discussion of the wage equation by Espasa he noted that the rate of change of the wage index could be significantly related to the real wage rate (with interpretation as in Sargan (1964)), but also to the ratio of average earnings to the wage rate index, with a possible interpretation that if earnings are high compared with the wage rate then activity is high, and also workers try to consolidate their temporary prosperity by incorporating the higher level of earnings into the basic wage rate. Alternatively the interaction between earnings and wage rates can perhaps be regarded as an inadequate and aggregated representation of the battle of the differentials. Previous work has attempted to build disaggregated models of the labour market in which each occupational group of workers responds to differentials between their own wage level and those of other groups of workers, for example the work by Vernon reported in Sargan (1971). Each macrovariable can be regarded as a differently weighted aggregate of the underlying microwage-variables, and the dynamic models which are estimated for the macro-variables represents an empirical attempt to represent the complex dynamics of the micro-model. Following the previous work by Johnston and Timbrell (1973) it was decided to explore the use of the income tax retention rate as a variable in the wage equation. It was also decided following Parkin et al (1972), (1976), to explore the use of expected rates of price inflation. The equations were initially estimated using single equation estimators, but were re-estimated by simultaneous equation system estimators. All the equations in this paper are in log linear form with the symbols representing the logarithms of the economic variables. The most general form of wage equation used can be summarized as",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a97-112..htm,10.2307/2297105

2174,Review of Economic Studies,Disequilibrium Estimates for Consumption Goods Markets in Centrally Planned Economies,"['Richard Portes', 'David Winter']","1980, vol. 47, issue 1, 137-159",[],"The centrally planned economies (CPEs) are said to suffer from sustained, significant repressed inflation (Grossman (1966); Bush (1973)). With stable official prices, visitors observe queues, shortages, and black market activity, and the East European press reports these phenomena in circumstantial detail. Scholars cite such anecdotal evidence and generalize from it (Katsenelinboigen (1977)). The literature stresses ""overfull employment"" or ""taut"" planning (Holzman (1956); Hunter (1961)), ""planners' tension "", ""pressure"" (Levine (1966)) or ""suction"" (Kornai (1971)); use of the consumer sector as a buffer to absorb unforeseen shocks; overfulfilment of the wage fund plan and underfulfilment of the real wage plan; ""excessive"" household savings; the rising subsidies required to maintain fixed prices (Garvy (1975)); quality deterioration, and ""hidden"" price increases. This is a fundamental proposition in the conventional wisdom about CPEs. We view it, however, as a hypothesis about macroeconomic relationships in CPEs drawn originally from unsystematic observation, which we are now able to test systematically against aggregate time-series data. This is our objective here. We do not doubt that there is excess real demand within the state production sector in CPEs, in part imposed consciously by the planners to elicit more output. Nor do we question that this could generate excess demand in the markets linking the state production sector to the household sector: the markets for consumer goods and services and for labour (Kornai (1978) so argues, although he focuses on the state production sector). But for these markets the planners have always stressed the importance of macroeconomic equilibrium because the effects of excess demand here are so clearly dysfunctional (disincentives to labour supply, black markets, weakening of ""labour discipline"", etc.). The ""balance of money incomes and expenditures of the population"" (BMIEP) is a key element in the planning process, and the planners dispose of powerful policy instruments to achieve its targets (Portes (1977); Rudcenko (1978)). Again, we do not question that there are numerous chronic and substantial microlevel disequilibria: excess demands for certain goods (housing, meat, automobiles, and many varieties-especially those of higher quality-of other goods at a more disaggregated level), but also well-publicized excess supplies of others (e.g. low-quality clothing often accumulates in ""immobile "", ""unsaleable"" stocks).

2175,Review of Economic Studies,The Relationship between Interest Rates and Metal Price Movements,"['Geoffrey Heal', 'Michael Barrow']","1980, vol. 47, issue 1, 161-181",[],"In recent years there have been many analyses of the rate of resource depletion, both with a view to defining an optimal depletion rate (as in Dasgupta and Heal (1974), Heal (1975)) and also with a view to analysing the depletion rate that one might expect to result from market forces (as in Dasgupta (1973), Solow (1974), Stiglitz (1974)). It is easily established (see Heal (1975), Solow (1974)) that a necessary condition for a finite stock of an exhaustible resource to be allocated efficiently over time is that the price, net of extraction costs, should rise at a rate equal to the rate of return on other assets. And, not surprisingly, competitive markets will under certain circumstances realize this condition. In particular, if owners of the resource regard it as a capital asset constituting an element of their portfolio, then they will hold it just as long as the return that it gives them (the rate of increase of the net price) is no less than the returns available elsewhere. Equilibrium in the asset market will then imply the realization of the necessary condition mentioned earlier. This simple but convincing theorizing clearly implies that if resource markets are functioning efficiently, there will be a strong association between the rates of change of resource prices and the rates of return on other assets. In particular, as certain commodities (for example, copper, tin, lead and zinc) are exhaustible resources, the theory would predict that in an efficient allocation the rates of change of their prices would be related to rates of return on other assets. Our aim in this paper is to construct and test a series of models of resource markets whose demand and supply functions incorporate the idea that an exhaustible resource is an asset whose rate of price appreciation is a factor determining holding decisions, and which explicitly recognize the possibility of arbitrage between resource markets and markets for other capital assets. The conclusions we reach are very tentative, but suggest that the matter is considerably more complex than simple equilibrium theory would suggest. In particular, the returns to other assets do appear to be important determinants of resource price movements, but it seems to be changes in these returns, rather than their level, that have the greatest influence. There are a variety of possible explanations of this, and we try to discriminate between these in the latter part of the paper.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a47_3ay_3a1980_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a161-181..htm,10.2307/2297108

Breusch', 'Adrian Pagan']","1980, vol. 47, issue 1, 239-253",[],"Many econometric models are susceptible to analysis only by asymptotic techniques and there are three principles, based on asymptotic theory, for the construction of tests of parametric hypotheses. These are: (i) the Wald (W) test which relies on the asymptotic normality of parameter estimators, (ii) the maximum likelihood ratio (LR) procedure and (iii) the Lagrange multiplier (LM) method which tests the effect on the first order conditions for a maximum of the likelihood of imposing the hypothesis. In the econometric literature, most attention seems to have been centred on the first two principles. Familiar "" t-tests "" usually rely on the W principle for their validity while there have been a number of papers advocating and illustrating the use of the LR procedure. However, all three are equivalent in well-behaved problems in the sense that they give statistics with the same asymptotic distribution when the null hypothesis is true and have the same asymptotic power characteristics. Choice of any one principle must therefore be made by reference to other criteria such as small sample properties or computational convenience. In many situations the W test is attractive for this latter reason because it is constructed from the unrestricted estimates of the parameters and their estimated covariance matrix. The LM test is based on estimation with the hypothesis imposed as parametric restrictions so it seems reasonable that a choice between W or LM be based on the relative ease of estimation under the null and alternative hypotheses. Whenever it is easier to estimate the restricted model, the LM test will generally be more useful. It then provides applied researchers with a simple technique for assessing the adequacy of their particular specification. This paper has two aims. The first is to exposit the various forms of the LM statistic and to collect together some of the relevant research reported in the mathematical statistics literature. The second is to illustrate the construction of LM tests by considering a number of particular econometric specifications as examples. It will be found that in many instances the LM statistic can be computed by a regression using the residuals of the fitted model which, because of its simplicity, is itself estimated by OLS. The paper contains five sections. In Section 2, the LM statistic is outlined and some alternative versions of it are discussed.

The usual unbiased estimator of o.2 is s2= (y -Xb)'(y -Xb)/(Tk). In situations in which we wish only to decide whether H is true or not we can use a direct test of H such as an F test. It is perhaps more common that when H is rejected we want to know which components of 6 are different from zero and of the non-zero components which are positive and which negative. In this situation we have a multiple decision problem and a natural solution is to use an induced test. As an example suppose in the case q = 2 that we wish to test the hypothesis H: 01 =02 = 0. Since H is true if and only if the separate hypotheses H1: 01 = 0 and H2: 02= 0 are both true, this suggests a sequence of separate tests which will induce a test of H.

2180,Review of Economic Studies,Testing Linear versus Logarithmic Regression Models,"['Gwyn Aneuryn-Evans', 'Angus Deaton']","1980, vol. 47, issue 1, 275-291",[],"One of the problems most frequently encountered by the applied econometrician is the choice between logarithmic and linear regression models. Economic theory is rarely of great help although there are cases where one or other specification is clearly inappropriate; for example, in demand analysis constant elasticity specifications are inconsistent with the budget constraint. Nor are standard statistical tests very useful; R2 statistics are not commensurable between models with dependent variables in levels and in logarithms and the comparison of likelihoods has no firm basis in statistical inference. In this paper, we develop a practical text based upon Cox's ((1961) and (1962)) procedure for testing separate families of hypotheses; the work is thus an extension of earlier econometric applications of Cox's test to single equation linear regressions in Pesaran (1974) and to many equation non-linear regression in Pesaran and Deaton (1978). The test we develop here is applicable to two competing single-equation models, one of which explains the level of a variable up to an additive error, the other of which explains its logarithm, again up to an additive error. Hence, in terms of the levels of the variables, we are testing for multiplicative versus additive errors, and it is this which differentiates this paper from the earlier work in which an additive error was always assumed. We shall also allow, as in the earlier papers, the deterministic parts of the regressions to be linear or non-linear and to have the same or different independent variables; it is thus possible to test for functional form and specification in a very general way. Section 1 of the paper defines the problem and derives the test statistics. The formulae allow the calculation of two statistics, No and N1 say, the first of which is asymptotically distributed as N(0, 1) if the logarithmic specification is correct, the second, for all practical purposes, as N(0, 1) if the linear model is true. Section 2 discusses problems associated with the calculation of the statistics and shows how they can be surmounted. Section 3 presents the results of Monte-Carlo experiments designed to evaluate the potential of the test in practice. We investigate, in particular, the shape of the actual distributions of No and N1 in samples of sizes 20, 40 and 80 as well as comparing the performance of the Cox procedure with that of the likelihood ratio test, as proposed by Sargan (1964). Finally, we offer some evidence of the ability of the procedure to detect total misspecification when neither of the hypotheses is true. Section 4 contains a summary and conclusions. The general issues of statistical inference raised by the use of the Cox procedure in econometrics as well as alternative testing procedures have already been widely discussed, see Pesaran and Deaton (1978), Quandt (1974) and Amemiya (1976). In this case, however, there exists one very obvious alternative procedure.

2182,Review of Economic Studies,Quality and Quantity Competition,['Avinash Dixit'],"1979, vol. 46, issue 4, 587-599",[],"Non-price competition is observed in many oligopolistic industries, and raises important policy questions. For example, it is often thought that there is an excess of it in industries such as the airlines when they successfully enforce collusion over price. Another instance is the recent discussion on whether legal and medical professions should be allowed to advertise. While such issues have a long history of general debate in industrial economics, there have been very few attempts to pin them down by constructing precise models. Spence (1975) and Sheshinski (1976) have recently analysed quality and quantity choices of a monopolist, and Spence (1977) has studied the case of Chamberlinian monopolistic competition, in each case comparing the market equilibrium and the social optimum. In monopoly both variables are collusively set, while in the Chamberlinian case they are both competitively set. However, the most interesting aspect of many practical issues is the interaction between collusion in one dimension and competition in the other. The possibility of enforcing a collusive decision generally differs with respect to different choice variables, and competitive decisions react to collusion elsewhere. The various conceivable equilibria should be compared with each other as well as with the social optimum. That is the aim of this paper. When analysing the problem, we must also consider the total number of products in the industry. If this is competitively set, i.e. if there is free entry, then any power to control the other variables might as well not be used, since entry will eliminate profit in any case. If entry can be controlled, it becomes important to specify the objective. Where one member is one product, as in the professions, it seems sensible to maximize profit per product. But where there is a fixed number of members with a variable number of products per member, as with a fixed number of airlines setting flight schedules, total profit becomes the maximand. The outcome turns out to depend crucially on this distinction. If the collusive objective is profit per product, it is found that control of entry is tantamount to total control. Once entry has been set at its collusive optimum level, competitive individuals will make quantity and quality choices that are the same as the collusive optima. This is essentially an "" envelope "" property. On the other hand, if the collusive goal is total profit, equilibria for different combinations of collusion and competition differ. It is found that quality competition is used in an overcompensating manner if quantity competition is suppressed, but the welfare effect of this is ambiguous. In some parameter ranges it is found that welfare is lowered by enforcement of competition in only one dimension; these are specific occurrences of the general second-best possibility. Quality choice and advertising are two aspects of non-price competition. In my model they affect demand in the same way and therefore have identical positive comparative static effects. But advertising affects the standard of welfare judgement and therefore needs a different treatment of its normative effects; see Dixit and Norman (1978). This distinction should be borne in mind when applying the results that follow.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a587-599..htm,10.2307/2297029

2184,Review of Economic Studies,The Role of Speculation in Competitive Price-Dynamics,['Peter Howitt'],"1979, vol. 46, issue 4, 613-629",[],"It has been shown by Kaldor (1939, especially pp. 8-10) that the degree of price stabilizing speculation in a market depends upon two elasticities: (i) the elasticity of expected price with respect to current price, and (ii) the elasticity of speculative excess demand with respect to the difference between current and expected price. Speculation will generally stabilize the current price about the expected price, since a wide gap between the two gives rise to a counteracting pressure on the current price from the speculative excess demand. The smaller the first elasticity the smaller will be the fluctuations in the expected price resulting from fluctuations in underlying factors of supply or demand. The larger is the second elasticity the more closely will fluctuations in the current price reflect fluctuations in the expected price. Kaldor's analysis, like much of the more recent literature on speculation and stability (Friedman (1953), Telser (1959)) addresses the question of whether or not speculation will serve its traditionally cited role of ironing out some of the fluctuations in prevailing market prices that would occur in its absence. The question of speculation and stability has been phrased somewhat differently in the literature on general competitive analysis (Hicks (1939), Enthoven and Arrow (1956), Arrow and Nerlove (1958), Arrow and Hurwicz (1962), Arrow and Hahn (1971, 309-315)) where it is asked whether or not the presence of speculation makes it more likely that the process of market adjustment will converge asymptotically upon an equilibrium. In both of these branches of the literature the focus has been upon the first of Kaldor's elasticities, and the results have confirmed Kaldor's analysis. Putting the question either way, we may say (roughly) that speculation exerts a stabilizing influence if the elasticity of price expectations is less than unity, or if expectations are formed adaptively (Cagan (1956), Arrow and Nerlove (1958)), it exerts no influence on stability if the elasticity is unity, and it exerts a destabilizing influence if the elasticity exceeds unity or if expectations are formed extrapolatively (Arrow and McManus (1958)). The purpose of the present paper is to examine the importance of the second of Kaldor's elasticities for the convergence of the market adjustment process. In the context of a single market it is clear that if this elasticity is large enough the price-adjustment process will be stable, provided that the formation of expectations is not destabilizing, because, regardless of the slope of the non-speculative excess demand curve, a large enough elasticity of the speculative excess demand curve will imply a downward slope to the market excess demand curve. The central question of the present paper is whether or not the analogous result holds in the multi-market economy of general competitive analysis. The answer to this question is vital to the broader issue of the influence of speculation on stability, because the size of this elasticity can be interpreted as defining the existing degree of speculation. The characteristic feature of speculation that distinguishes it from similar activities, such as hedging or investing, that also may be influenced by future price expectations, is that speculation is primarily motivated by the expectation of capital gain, not by the desire to consume or otherwise transform commodities, to avoid risk, or to",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a613-629..htm,10.2307/2297031

A great deal of work has concerned itself with weakening the conditions required for equilibrium in a competitive economy; relatively little research has, however, examined the possibilities for its existence in economies with fundamentally different rules of behaviour. A number of articles have examined what are essentially competitive models with non-competitive elements in them, in particular with the presence of a governmental agency that collects and redistributes taxes and, in some cases, produces public goods. Shoven (1976) and Shoven and Whalley (1972, 1973) assume private production under competitive conditions and a government that acts purely as a tax collector. Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) consider only public production and introduce a special tax on labour income and a tax on the aggregate value of transactions in certain selected commodities. Fourgeaud (1969) has a more complicated model in which, with the usual assumptions about motivations of the firm and the consumer, there are ad-valorem taxes on the sales and purchases of commodities, the tax rate being the same in both cases, a proportional profit tax, and a tax on fixed income. He also assumes that labour is inelastically supplied and that government administrators have preferences on the production of public goods. In Mantel (1975) the government has preferences on public goods and private consumption, and consumer preferences are interdependent, and Foley (1970) assumes that consumers decide upon a tax scheme to produce the public goods that they desire, and that the level of production of public goods affects the levels of production and consumption of private goods. In this paper we construct a one period model of a very non-competitive economy, one that is based upon a traditional Soviet-type system, and examine a modified notion of equilibrium in it. The model differs from those analysed in the papers we have just mentioned in several aspects, the most important of which we may briefly discuss before we begin the consideration of the model itself. Producers in our system are not profit maximizers, but rather have quantity oriented incentive functions. The concept of profits only enters as a constraint imposed by the central planners upon producers in order to restrain them from producing outputs that would require excessive subsidies. The system of turnover, profit, and income taxes that we shall describe has a role in this Soviet model unlike those taxes in the various competitive models, since in each of those models the competitive solution without taxes is always a feasible solution, and, indeed, guarantees the nonemptiness of the solution set. In our case, however, the tax scheme is an essential part of the planning procedure, since without it, as we shall see, there would not be an equilibrium",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a631-652..htm,10.2307/2297032

2187,Review of Economic Studies,On Variable Majority Rule and Kramer's Dynamic Competitive Process,['Douglas H. Blair'],"1979, vol. 46, issue 4, 667-673",[],"This paper defines and characterizes axiomatically two rational voting procedures which are variants of simple majority rule. The rules are closely related and coincide when individual indifference is excluded. Some of the conditions used are then discussed and related to similar properties that have been studied in the social choice literature. It has long been known that a majority winner in a field of three or more candidates need not exist in general unless the preferences of the electorate display some degree of similarity. Sen and Pattanaik (1969) derived a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a majority preference relation to be well behaved. Kramer (1973) studied these conditions in the context of quasi-concave differentiable preferences over a multidimensional Euclidean choice space, the natural setting for most economic decision models, and showed that they were extremely restrictive. Even the most modest diversity in preferences causes a violation of all the Sen-Pattanaik conditions in Rn. At least two reactions are possible to Kramer's important theorem. One response is to deny its relevance to actual political systems; few collectivities in fact make decisions by pairwise comparisons of all feasible alternatives using direct majority rule. Building on the work of Downs (1956), much effort has been devoted to the analysis of spatial models in which the electorate votes only on alternatives advocated by a small number of parties or candidates. But the existence of equilibria in these models has until recently been equally problematic (see Riker and Ordeshook (1972) for an overview of spatial models). In another paper Kramer (1977) has recently developed a model in this tradition which is the most general structure yet examined in which majority voting is at all well behaved. The model is a dynamic one in which two parties are assumed to compete for votes in a series of elections over time. The parties choose as platforms points in a multidimensional policy space with the objective of maximizing the number of votes the party receives in the next election. Each voter chooses his most preferred party according to his spherical indifference map. Kramer shows that the sequence of successively-enacted policies tends to converge to a relatively small subset of the feasible policy alternatives. It is of considerable interest to know what normative properties are exhibited by this decision process. The social preference relation which the competing parties implicitly maximize is the second of the rules to be axiomatized in this paper. There is a second possible response to the difficulties posed by the restrictiveness of the Sen-Pattanaik conditions in economic models. One might look for ways to "" repair "" defective (i.e. cyclic) majority preference relations without straying too far from simple majority rule and thereby losing its desirable normative characteristics. Craven (1971), Schwartz (1972), Brown (forthcoming), Ferejohn and Grether (1974) and Young (1977), for example, have investigated such procedures.

2188,Review of Economic Studies,Labour Unions and the Wage Structure: A General Equilibrium Approach,['John S. Pettengill'],"1979, vol. 46, issue 4, 675-693",[],"In recent years a number of studies have been published which tend to show that wage differentials (in particular the college/high school wage differential) are greater than justified by the corresponding differences in productivity (see for example Eckaus (1964), Berg (1971), Taubman and Wales (1973) and Thurow (1975)). The evidence is tenuous, and has been vigorously controverted (e.g. Scoville (1966)). However the major resistance seems so have been on theoretical grounds. These studies directly contradict the predictions of Marshall's (1931, Bk. 6, Chs. 3-6) model of relative wages in a competitive economy based on comparative advantage, and this is taken as a-priori grounds for rejecting them (e.g. Layard and Psacharopoulos (1974)). This article is an attempt to explain the above-cited observations by a theoretical analysis of the long-run impact of labour unions on the structure of relative wages. It is generally agreed that in the short run labour unions can affect the real wages of their members. But in the long run, when the labour market has come into equilibrium, a worker of given characteristics should make the same amount whether or not he is employed on a unionized job. All the employees who originally helped organize the union (and who benefited therefrom by getting more than their market wage) will have retired, and the new employees will be the best the employer can hire for the wage offered.' But it does not follow that unions as a whole have not affected the wage structure (the relationship between the quality of a worker and his relative wage). Rather I shall show that in the long run unions increase the relative wages earned by all high quality workers (whether or not union members), and decrease the relative wages earned by low quality workers. However I shall not consider the impact of unionism on labour's share of national income, and will therefore not advance any opinion concerning the impact of unions on the real (as opposed to relative) wages of any quality of labour. The mechanism is that in the long run an employer, faced with having to pay a higher wage than he would voluntarily, will (ceteris paribus) upgrade his employment standards and attempt to hire the highest quality labour he can get for that wage (at least in the United States where most employers control the quality of labour they hire). Aggregated over many employers and unions, this represents a substantial shift in demand towards higher-quality labour. But (ignoring education, etc. for now) there are no more highquality workers for them to hire. One's natural economic intuition is that the wages of high quality labour will be bid up relative to the wages of low quality labour until the demand for high quality labour is back in balance with the supply. A good analogy is the effect of sulphur emission controls on the premium paid for lowsulphur oils. In response to the emission controls, each user attempts to buy lower-sulphur oil than previously. Of course in aggregate they can't upgrade the quality of the oils used",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a675-693..htm,10.2307/2297035

More recently he has noted that several of these concepts can be applied to the case where part or all of the consumers' income is endogenous arising, for example, from consumers' leisure and/or savings decisions (Muellbauer (forthcoming)). Since much empirical work in this area uses aggregate labour supply functions (e.g. Abbott and Ashenfelter (1976), Phlips (1978)) there is some interest in depicting classes of preferences which permit such an aggregate treatment. The purpose of the present note is to demonstrate a particular theorem that may perhaps represent the most fruitful approach for empirical applications either in the field of the estimation of consumer demand systems or in the formulation of the functional form of the personal income distribution.

2195,Review of Economic Studies,The Distance Function in Consumer Behaviour with Applications to Index Numbers and Optimal Taxation,['Angus Deaton'],"1979, vol. 46, issue 3, 391-405",[],"The use of duality concepts has now become widespread in production and consumption theory. In both of these areas, one of the central and most useful concepts is the cost or expenditure function which represents tastes or technology through the minimum cost to consumer or producer of reaching a particular utility or output level at given prices. Under utility maximizing or cost minimizing assumptions, the value of this function is actual outlay, so that the cost function defines the relation between expenditure, prices and utility or production as the case may be. For many problems, prices and outlay are the natural variables with which to work, and it is this that makes the cost function such a convenient representation of preferences. Even so, the mathematical properties of the cost function, particularly its homogeneity and concavity, give it decisive advantages over either direct or indirect utility functions even in situations where quantities are the more natural variables. For this reason, it is useful to consider the dual of the cost function itself, retaining its mathematical properties, but defined on primal, rather than dual variables. This dual is the distance function, sometimes also referred to as the transformation function, the gauge function, or the direct cost function. This function has made a number of distinguished but infrequent appearances in the literature. Wold (1943) uses it to relate quantity bundles to a given reference vector and thus to define a utility function. Debreu (1951) defines a "" coefficient of resource utilization"" through the distance function while Malmquist (1953) develops a systematic theory of quantity indices based upon it. In production theory, the distance function is discussed by Shephard (1953) and more recently is systematically and extensively used in the forthcoming monograph by Fuss and McFadden (1978), especially in the contributions by McFadden and by Hanoch. In the demand context, the function is briefly discussed by Diewert (1974), but the main contributions are in an unpublished paper by Gorman (1970) and, more briefly, in Gorman (1976). The function is used in a number of recent publications, notably by Blackorby and Russell (1975), Hanoch (1975), Blackorby and Donaldson (1976), Blackorby, Lovell and Thursby (1976) and Diewert (1976a) and (1976b). The aim of the present paper is to present a reasonably systematic, if informal presentation of the distance function in the context of consumer behaviour. Much of what follows is derived from one or more of the contributions listed above. However, none of these provides anything like a complete treatment, and in view of the wide range of potential applications of the analysis, in particular to demand studies, to rationing theory and to welfare economics generally, a synthesis of such useful material is overdue.

2196,Review of Economic Studies,"Consumer Preferences, Linear Demand Functions and Aggregation in Competitive Asset Markets",['Frank Milne'],"1979, vol. 46, issue 3, 407-417",[],"In Arrow (1970) and Debreu (1959) it was shown that one could obtain a well-defined economic theory with uncertainty over states of the world, which was formally equivalent to the certainty theory of value. Although the Arrow-Debreu framework is a useful starting-point for introducing uncertainty, its complete market assumption is patently unrealistic, so that most subsequent research has been directed toward incomplete market models. Compared with the elegant generality of the original Arrow-Debreu formulation, subsequent models abound with restrictive assumptions upon consumer preferences and probability distributions.' Since the pioneering work of Arrow and Pratt (1964) on measures of risk-aversion, many writers have applied these measures, or their derivative utility functions, to problems under uncertainty. Furthermore, there has developed a literature in Finance Theory, which has evolved the closely related HARA class2 of utility functions, from which one can deduce a number of interesting aggregation theorems. What is not widely understood, is that much of this recent work is intimately related to the theory of aggregation which has a comparatively long history in economic theory. By making explicit the relationship between these two bodies of knowledge, one can gain important insights and generalizations of these recent results in uncertainty economics. In essence, the HARA class (which is in fact a generalization of the older Bergson class of utility function) generates linear affine Engel curves for assets. Of course, linear Engel curves considerably simplify an analysis of the consumer's problem. Furthermore, it is well known that if agents have linear Engel curves with the same slope, then this is a necessary and sufficient condition for aggregation over the agents. Given these two results, it's easy to see a simple geometric interpretation of a whole literature in uncertainty theory; and to see its advantages and limitations. The paper has been divided into six sections; Section 1 surveys additive utility functions with linear Engel curves; Section 2 summarizes the Gorman, representative-consumer theorem; Section 3 translates the theorems of the previous sections into the Arrow-Debreu complete market model and obtains particular cases for the more general results; Section 4 considers a two period incomplete market model and the aggregation theorem; Section 5 extends the analysis to many periods; and Section 6 provides some general concluding comments.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a407-417..htm,10.2307/2297010

2200,Review of Economic Studies,Household Bequest Behaviour and the National Distribution of Wealth,['John Laitner'],"1979, vol. 46, issue 3, 467-483",[],"Much of the theoretical literature on the distribution of wealth among households concentrates on identifying continuous-time Markov process models which have specific stationary distributions (see, for example, Sargan (1957), Wold and Whittle (1957), and Steindl (1972)). That research, which is highly technical, devotes little attention to the role of economic behavioural factors. Studies which are more concerned with the exact character of the wealth transfer process, on the other hand, often eliminate all interpersonal income differences so that the stationary distribution of wealth for each generation collapses to a single value (see Meade (1966), Stiglitz (1969), and Atkinson (1971)). The purpose of this paper is to prove the existence and uniqueness of a non-trivial stationary distribution of wealth for a simple growth model the key component of which is a utility-maximization theory of the bequest behaviour of individual families. The growth model, an adaptation of Samuelson's (1958) consumption-loan model, assumes that exogenous factors determine the intragenerational distribution of labour incomes and that the distribution remains unchanged over time. The theory of household bequest behaviour modifies the familiar tenet that each family's utility comes solely from its own consumption to the following: a family's utility is a function not only of its own consumption, but also of the consumption of its descendants in all future generations. For simplicity we assume that individual families live only one period; that there is only one output good; that either the good is storable or that there is a fixed supply of money (and money can be transferred between generations); that all existing family lines will continue forever; and, that all families have identical preference orderings. These assumptions cause each household's direct utility function to have an infinite number of arguments. If the interest rate on holdings of money is constant because of permanent, steady-state growth, however, each family's indirect utility function depends only on that interest rate and present family wealth. Assuming that preferences are additively separable and stationary in the Koopmans' (1960) sense, Bellman's (1957) "" principle of optimality "" enables us to define the indirect function with the aid of a single recursive functional equation. We can, in turn, use the indirect utility function to determine each family's optimal bequest. Although every household's utility-maximizing bequest is a single-valued function of its wealth, the function will not be linear. In fact, although we can establish many of its mathematical characteristics, we cannot represent the function explicitly. Nevertheless, using Doob's (1953) theorems on discrete-time, continuous-state-space Markov processes, we can prove that provided each household's indirect utility function is finite, associated with each fixed distribution of labour incomes and steady-state interest rate there is a unique stationary distribution of wealth. After presenting our model of family bequest behaviour in Section 1, in Section 2 we study in greater detail the properties of the function relating each family's wealth and optimal bequest. Section 3 proves the existence of a unique stationary distribution of wealth, and Section 4 constructs a complete growth model. In Section 4 we prove the surprising proposition that in the case of an economy with perishable goods and money",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a467-483..htm,10.2307/2297014

The recent contributions of Feldstein (1974) and Grieson (1975) consider the comparative steady-state effects of substituting a tax on capital income for a tax on labour income in standard single-sector neo-classical growth models with a constantly growing labour supply.' This is a natural extension of the comparative stationary-state tax incidence studies of Harberger (1962), Mieszkowski (1967) and many subsequent authors,2 and it has the merit that it is algebraically quite simple to analyse. The results obtained in the long-run models are in striking contrast to those obtained in the models with fixed capital stocks. In a static model with fixed factor supplies, a general-factor tax is entirely borne by the factor whose income is taxed.3 Under reasonable assumptions about elasticities of substitution in production and demand, a partial factor tax (e.g. corporate income tax) will also be largely borne by the owners of the partially-taxed factor. In the long run, however, radically different results can occur owing to the ability of the taxed factor to shift the tax by an induced change in factor proportions in the economy. Thus, Feldstein finds that "" for a wide range of plausible parameter values, a substantial fraction of the burden of a general profits tax is borne by labour"" (page 505). Similarly, Grieson finds that substitution of a wage for a profits tax may well make wage earners better off since the increased capital-labour ratio may cause the gross-of-tax wage rate to rise by more than tax payments on wages. It would be premature to derive policy prescriptions from these results based on a comparison of steady states. The difficulty is that economies may never reach the steady state either before or after the tax changes under consideration and, therefore, at best comparative steady-state analysis may indicate only long-run tendencies.4 Since the process of tax shifting through a change in capital accumulation takes time, comparative steadystate analysis may be quite inappropriate for considering the effects of tax changes over more limited time horizons. In this paper, we shall analyse the effect of tax changes on the growth path of an economy between two arbitrary points of time in a single-sector neoclassical model similar to those used by Feldstein and Grieson. The method of analysis, which we may call comparative dynamics, allows us to study the process of tax shifting over time. While the analysis is not restricted to the steady state, we can use it to study the movement of the economy from one steady state to another in response to a tax change. The results that we obtain indicate that, indeed, comparative steady-state analysis is likely to be misleading in analysing tax incidence over finite periods of time.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a505-511..htm,10.2307/2297016

Proponents of disclosure argue that providing information will make markets more competitive. The statutory preamble to the famed Truth in Lending Law ("" TIL "") recites: "" The Congress finds that ... competition among the various financial institutions and other firms engaged in the extension of consumer credit would be strengthened by the informed use of credit "". Also, the recent Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act provides: "" In order to ... improve competition in the marketing of consumer products, any warrantor shall ... fully and conspicuously disclose ... the terms and conditions of such warranty "". Legal opponents of disclosure argue that consumers will not read the information provided. Several studies of the ""effectiveness "" of TIL, summarized in the Report of the National Commission on Consumer Finance, are cited by both sides. Those studies indicate that the number of people unaware of the Annual Percentage Rate paid on credit for recent purchases ranges from almost 90 per cent in poverty areas to 52 per cent in markets populated by relatively affluent buyers. Opponents of disclosure argue that such low awareness levels are inconsistent with the existence of competitive markets. The apparent force of this point is partly responsible for the schizophrenic nature of American consumer protection legislation. The statutes quoted above, despite their paens to disclosure, also regulate the substance of consumer sales contracts. For example, the Magnuson-Moss Act requires the disclosure of warranty terms, but also prohibits sellers in many cases from shifting purchase risks to buyers. Proponents of disclosure regulation, however, argue that the awareness levels reported above will easily yield competitive outcomes. Thus Senator Douglas, the principal legislative supporter of TIL, asserted, unfortunately without explanation, that a competitive market would exist if "" only"" 10 per cent of the consumers were "" cost conscious "". The inconclusiveness of this debate seems largely a function of the absence of rigorous analytical tools with which to answer the question how much information is enough. Surprisingly little attention has been devoted to the issue in the economics literature. This paper reflects the beginning of an attempt to resolve it. In particular, it addresses two questions: First, what kinds of equilibria exist when various percentages of consumers are informed? Second, is reducing consumer search costs, the standard technique of modern disclosure legislation, useful in generating competitive equilibria? Both questions are central to the current public policy debate respecting the form which state intervention in consumer markets should take. The equilibrium search models which have been developed in recent years are capable of addressing these questions rigorously. This paper develops one such model which incorporates elements of fixed sample size search.

Russell', 'Tae Kun Seo']","1979, vol. 46, issue 3, 555-559",[],"The strategy of diversification has been demonstrated to be optimal for risk averting investors under a variety of conditions.' Of course, diversification remains the best strategy under the same conditions even if agents are restricted to a proper subset of all risk averters. When agents are so restricted, new sufficient conditions which differ significantly from previously published results can be derived. One interesting subset of risk averters can be defined by designating a particular agent to be the least risk averse one in the set and only agents at least as risk averse as he are then admissible. Sets of this type are useful in those cases where it is simply inappropriate to insist that the admissible risk averters must range to the risk neutral agent.2 Nonetheless, it should be observed that if this type of subset is bounded by a risk neutral agent, we have the special case where the subset then coincides with the set of all risk averters. In this paper we shall consider two types of sets of risk averters but will focus principally'on the type of subsets described above. We shall provide new sufficient conditions under which diversified portfolios are unanimously preferred to the specialized ones. With a restricted subset of risk averters we can show that the condition of equal means for assets is no longer necessary for a unanimous decision to diversify.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a555-559..htm,10.2307/2297021
2208,Review of Economic Studies,Imperfect Competition and the Resource Allocative Effects of Effective Protection: Comment,"['John Dutton', 'Edward Tower']","1979, vol. 46, issue 3, 561-563",[],"Recently in this review, E. J. Ray (1976a) demonstrated two propositions concerning the impact of effective protection on resource allocation under imperfect competition in goods and factor markets. He provided an incorrect proof of his second (correct) proposition, and failed to place it in perspective. In this comment we provide an intuitively appealing but rigorous derivation of it, and note that it follows from Herberg and Kemp (1971), and is equally valid when there are no interindustry flows.' In the second section of his paper,2 Ray investigates the case in which a labour union in the manufacturing sector, X1, successfully maintains industrial wages, wl, at some constant multiple, b, times wages, w2, in the agricultural sector, X2. He assumes labour and capital are substitutable for one another in the production of value added in each sector and that to produce one unit of output for each good a fixed amount of the other is used as an input. Thus al2 is the number of units of X1 used as an input in producing one unit of X2 and a2l is the number of units of X2 used as input in producing one unit of output of XI. With this model Ray shows that changes in relative prices can have perverse effects on outputs. This is not surprising, for as Fishlow and David (1961) and Bhagwati and Ramaswami (1963) have noted and Johnson (1966) has shown, in the presence of a fixed relative wage differential the production possibility frontier may become unconventionally convex to the origin, and when the frontier is convex, one would not be surprised to find that the output of a good falls in response to a rise in its relative price. The problem is, however, more complex than that, because with a factor market distortion, the slope of the production possibility frontier will not be equal to the price ratio. In fact, as Herberg and Kemp (1971, p. 22) have shown in the context of the Ray model, with CES production functions and all aij's equal to zero, "" it is possible for the price-output relationship to be normal or conventional even when the locus of competitive outputs is (unconventionally) convex to the origin "".3 Moreover, as we have shown in an unpublished paper, in this same model with zero a's and variable elasticities of substitution, movement in the priceoutput ratio can be perverse whether the locus of competitive outputs is convex or concave.

The purpose of the original piece was to redress the imbalance in attention given to technical substitution possibilities relative to market conditions as a source of ambiguity in measuring the resource allocative effects of effective protection. The work by Dutton and Tower substantiates my original observations regarding the importance of market conditions and clarifies the economic interpretation of the condition for a perverse tariff effect in the presence of wage distortions. The observation that the statement of sufficient conditions for a perverse tariff effect when labour markets are imperfect implicitly assumes concavity of the production possibility frontier is correct. With a sign reversal, Condition (12) of my original paper would represent a necessary condition for a perverse tariff effect when the production possibility curve is assumed to be convex. The authors dismiss my alternative approach, summarized by the discussion surrounding Equations (13) and (14) of my original paper by stating "" While Ray's explanation of the phenomenon is perhaps the same as ours, we found ourselves unable to deduce our explanation from his exposition "".

2211,Review of Economic Studies,Symposium on Incentive Compatibility: Introduction,['Peter Hammond'],"1979, vol. 46, issue 2, 181-184",[],"The Review has a tradition of publishing papers on the subject of planning and of iterative planning procedures. On the whole, these papers have not addressed themselves at all to the important question of how the information from individual agents needed to implement a planning rule is to be elicited. The question is important because individual agents may well have an incentive to provide deliberately misleading information if this distorts the planning rule in their favour. The only minor exception to the general avoidance of this question came in brief discussions by Dreze and de la Vallee Poussin (1971) and by Malinvaud (1972), but their discussions were not thorough since the papers were more concerned with other matters. In recent years, however, particularly since the publication of Hurwicz's fundamental papers (1972), (1973), much work has been done on identifying "" incentive compatible "" planning mechanisms. These mechanisms, even if they do not necessarily encourage agents to reveal truthfully and directly the information a planner needs, at least lead to desirable outcomes even when agents do try to manipulate them. The reader who is completely unfamiliar with this field may wish to turn straight away to the early sections of the papers by Dasgupta, Hammond and Maskin and by Groves to see the incentive problem stated informally at greater length and then also formally. The papers in the present symposium have been collected and edited in collaboration with Ted Groves and Eric Maskin. They fall very naturally into an initial twofold classification, with the sole exception of Roberts. As he points out in the introduction to his paper, one can contrast global mechanisms in which each agent is concerned with the final outcome of the mechanism, with local mechanisms in which each agent is concentrating on the utility gain from each step of an iterative planning procedure. The first six papers and the last section of Roberts, all concern themselves with the global mechanisms. By contrast, the bulk of Roberts' paper, as well as those by Henry, by Tulkens and Zamir and by Schoumaker, all consider a particular local mechanism-namely, the specific adjustment procedure for planning with public goods which was proposed by Malinvaud (1972) and by Dreze and de la Vallee Poussin (1971). This procedure is called "" M.D.P. "" for short. The earlier papers showed that the procedure guaranteed convergence to a Pareto efficient outcome provided agents reveal their true marginal rates of substitution or "" demand prices "" throughout. Malinvaud (1972) also suggested that it would still converge, though rather more slowly, to a Pareto efficient outcome even if agents chose to misrepresent their true demand prices at each step in order to have their own utility increase as fast as possible. This slower convergence is demonstrated, for an economy with one public and one private good, by Roberts, who also shows the impossibility of guaranteeing Pareto efficient outcomes with a global mechanism, at least if agents just report their preference orderings. Henry refines Roberts' results for local mechanisms by restricting agents to announcing non-negative demand prices. He also considers the similar incentive problem which arises in a discrete version of the M.D.P. procedure, and shows that for this procedure too, convergence to a Pareto efficient outcome is guaranteed, given some mild assumptions about the agents' announcements of demand prices.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a181-184..htm,10.2307/2297044
2212,Review of Economic Studies,The Implementation of Social Choice Rules: Some General Results on Incentive Compatibility,"['Partha Dasgupta', 'Peter Hammond', 'Eric Maskin']","1979, vol. 46, issue 2, 185-216",[],"We shall assume that the objectives of a society are embodied in a certain social choice rule. A social choice rule (SCR) selects a set of feasible social states for each possible configuration of individual preferences and other characteristics. One interprets the choice set as the set of welfare optima. For example, given an Arrow social welfare function which embodies individual preferences in a social ordering, then a natural social choice rule is derived by maximizing this social ordering over the feasible set. Alternatively, the Pareto rule is the social choice rule which selects all Pareto efficient states, given individual preferences and the feasible set. These are two particular social choice rules which have received much attention, but our discussion will cover social choice rules in general. If the relevant characteristics of individual agents, such as preferences, happen to be publicly known, then the social choice rule can be implemented trivially because the choice set itself is known. The problem of incentive compatibility arises precisely because these characteristics are not known by the planner a priori. The planner may attempt to learn characteristics directly by asking agents to reveal them. In general, however, if the agents realize how the information they reveal is to be used, they will have an incentive to misrepresent. Then the task of the planner in implementing the social choice rule is more difficult. Obviously, he must use a planning mechanism of some kind, whose outcomes are possible social states. We shall assume that, when he devises the mechanism, the planner knows what social states are feasible, so that he can ensure that the final outcome is feasible. (See, however, Hurwicz, Maskin and Postlewaite (1978), which considers the more general problem where feasibility itself depends on unknown characteristics.) The planner, however, relies on signals from the individual agents to help him implement the social choice rule. It is assumed that each individual agent sends his own signal. The planner's mechanism is then a rule which specifies a social state for each list of signals sent by the individual agents. It is assumed that each agent knows the precise form of the mechanism the planner is using. Then each agent realizes that he is involved in a game, because the outcome of the mechanism depends on the signals which he and all the other",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a185-216..htm,10.2307/2297045
2213,Review of Economic Studies,Outcome Functions Yielding Walrasian and Lindahl Allocations at Nash Equilibrium Points,['Leonid Hurwicz'],"1979, vol. 46, issue 2, 217-225",[],"In this paper we shall present "" balanced outcome functions "". These are functions which, for any given set of messages by individual agents in the economy, determine as their outcome an economic allocation satisfying the resource balance constraints of the economyi.e. the constraints that, for any good, total demand must not exceed total supply. Now, it has been known for a long time that outcome functions realizing the Walrasian (or Lindahl) equilibrium correspondence can easily be constructed provided an auctioneer is permitted and balance not required. In unpublished work, Schmeidler has presented a balanced outcome function without an auctioneer which realizes the Walrasian correspondence when there are at least three traders; a later variant (in a forthcoming paper by the Author) appears also to work for two traders. As he himself noted, his outcome function is not individually feasible. It is also discontinuous. Groves and Ledyard (1977) proposed balance outcome functions whose equilibrium correspondences yield allocations which are Pareto optimal but not individually rational (in the sense that traders can be worse off than if they refused to trade at all), and hence not Lindahl allocations. Here again it is required that there be at least three traders. The outcome functions used by Groves and Ledyard are quadratic, and so smooth. For the pure exchange economy with at least three traders Hurwicz (1976) has constructed analogous balanced outcome functions which are Pareto optimal but not individually rational, as well as non-balanced outcome functions which are Pareto optimal (but not individually rational) when there are two traders. Shapley, Shubik, Schmeidler, Pazner and Postlewaite have also constructed feasible outcome functions that can yield allocations outside the Pareto optimal set. Either the outcome functions or the message spaces depend, however, on the initial endowment vectors, so that agents have to know one anothers' endowments. Thus, these outcome functions are not informationally decentralized. In the present paper we show balanced outcome functions that are smooth and, without employing an auctioneer, yield equivalence between Nash and Walrasian (or, where appropriate, Lindahl) allocations, for three or more traders. Our outcome functions are smooth, but not individually feasible away from equilibrium.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a217-225..htm,10.2307/2297046

2215,Review of Economic Studies,On Coalition Incentive Compatibility,"['Jerry Green', 'Jean-Jacques Laffont']","1979, vol. 46, issue 2, 243-254",[],"Progress has recently been made in the study of mechanisms designed to elicit, from economic agents, truthful revelation of their characteristics. The relevance of these results is best illustrated with reference to the free rider problem which occurs in public decision making. The Government must know agents' preferences to choose the best public projects, but it may be in agents' interest to provide distorted reports on their preferences. A class of mechanisms has been proposed by Vickrey (1961), Clarke (1971), Groves (1973) which has the property that, in environments with separable utility functions, truthful revelation of preferences is a dominant strategy for each individual and a Pareto optimal decision is taken. In this context, since unrestricted transfers of a private resource are allowed, Pareto optimality is interpreted to mean that the public decision taken is the same as that which would be associated with all Pareto optimal resource allocations. Alternatively, recognizing that the mechanism may engender a surplus or a deficit, it is natural to introduce an artificial agent (the government or planner) capable of absorbing this imbalance. Using the net transfer to this agent as his utility function, Pareto optimality can be interpreted in the usual manner for the enlarged set of agents. The impossibility of closing the mechanism while maintaining optimality and incentive compatibility has been proven by Hurwicz (1975), Green and Laffont (1976a) and Walker (1976) in various contexts. In Green and Laffont (1975) we have shown that the class of mechanisms proposed by Groves includes all such mechanisms. Furthermore, allowing more general mechanisms, we have proved that any satisfactory mechanism (i.e. any mechanism which takes Pareto optimal decisions and for which dominant strategies exist) is isomorphic to a Groves mechanism. The incentive compatibility obtained with these mechanisms applies to individuals; for each agent the truth is his best possible answer for any willingnesses to pay professed by the others. Even though it was soon realized (see Bennett and Conn (1976), Groves (1973) and Vickrey (1961)) that these mechanisms are vulnerable to manipulation by coalitions no analytical attempt to ameliorate this situation has yet been made. In Green and Laffont (1976b) we suggested the use of a sampling version of Groves mechanisms to mitigate this coalition problem by making cooperation very costly and unlikely. The purpose of this paper is to look more carefully into this question. If the structure of binding coalitions forms a partition of the agents and is known to the decision maker, then, by treating each coalition as a single agent, it is still possible to induce truthful revelation. When the decision maker does not know this structure, or when, a priori, any structure is possible, the mechanism must be designed to be incentive compatible for any coalition. This is clearly impossible. Should we then say that no positive result concerning coalition incentive compatibility can be obtained for Groves mechanisms?",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a243-254..htm,10.2307/2297048
2216,Review of Economic Studies,Manipulation via Endowments,['Andrew Postlewaite'],"1979, vol. 46, issue 2, 255-262",[],"A competitive allocation in an exchange economy has several desirable properties; it is (with minimal assumptions) Pareto optimal and it guarantees that each trader doesn't lose utility in the trade. Besides these properties of efficiency and individual rationality, however, there are undesirable properties such as its manipulability. There is the possibility that an agent can behave as though his utility function is other than the true utility function and achieve a better outcome (higher utility for him) than at a true competitive outcome. Hurwicz (1972) has shown that this manipulability isn't unique to the competitive process, but in fact is common to any reallocation scheme which achieves Pareto optimal, individually rational outcomes. Besides manipulation via the agent's utility function, there is another type of manipulation, namely of the agent's endowment. In theory, an agent's endowment can be known to all people through inspection and therefore undetectable manipulation is impossible. In practice, however, it is often impossible to determine an agent's true endowment. Even if it were possible to determine true endowments, given a private ownership structure, there is no way of preventing an agent from destroying all or some portion of his endowment. In economies in which there are many agents, each of whom initially owns (at most) a small share of the total amount of a commodity the advantages of these types of manipulation would be small. It is straightforward to apply the techniques used by Roberts and Postlewaite (1976) to show (with similar assumptions as used there) that as an economy gets large agents have diminishing incentive to manipulate endowments. However, in economies in which there are small numbers of agents, large agents, or coalitions of agents the manipulation of the competitive mechanism is theoretically possible. Situations in which farmers withhold from market or destroy portions of their crops are possible instances of coalitional attempts to manipulate via endowments. In international trade we normally must consider agents who are not insignificant and potentially can upset "" competitive "" allocations through manipulation. Because of this possible manipulation of the competitive mechanism, it becomes interesting to investigate the possibility of designing alternative mechanisms which are not manipulable. In this paper we will show that the problem of manipulation by withholding endowments is not unique to the competitive mechanism, but rather is shared by any Pareto optimal, individually rational scheme of reallocating resources. We show that manipulation via destruction of endowments, however, can be avoided and give an example of a resource reallocation scheme which cannot be manipulated in this way. Finally, we consider manipulation by coalitions and show that if coalitions can "" pre-trade "", that is, form a submarket among themselves, they may be able to enter the larger market in an improved position. We show that all Pareto optimal individually rational reallocation schemes are susceptible to this form of manipulation and discuss stability problems which therefore arise. 2.

2218,Review of Economic Studies,Incentives in Planning Procedures for the Provision of Public Goods,['John Roberts'],"1979, vol. 46, issue 2, 283-292",[],"In the past few years several studies have addressed the problem of designing decentralized mechanisms for determining an efficient allocation of resources in the presence of public goods. A crucial feature of such mechanisms is the incentives that are provided for the participants to supply correct information about their preferences, since, unless proper incentives are present, self-interested behaviour may frustrate the realization of efficiency. As has long been recognized, the study of such self-interested, strategic behaviour and of incentive problems in general must be essentially game-theoretic in nature. However, there are many possible specifications of the game that arise when agents under such a mechanism can decide whether or not to reveal their preferences correctly. Each such specification yields a different formalization of such concepts as self-interest and incentive compatibility. Correspondingly, very different patterns of behaviour may emerge under different formulations of the game of preference revelation. In this note we will be concerned with one aspect of this problem, namely, the specification of the pay-off functions in the context of planning procedures with public goods. The games we will consider will be non-cooperative ones in which the players are the agents (consumers) in the process and the strategy sets consist of messages the agents can send regarding what their preferences are. (These messages may, in fact, be complete preference orderings.) This much is more or less common to most studies of incentive questions. However, in many iterative planning procedures, a proposed allocation is generated at each iteration. This gives rise to a choice as to the pay-off functions in the game. On the one hand, one might hypothesize that agents will be concerned only with what they will finally receive. This leads to specifying the pay-off to each player as the utility to him under his true preferences of the final allocation selected. We will refer to the game with this pay-off as the global game. Alternatively, one might argue that it is more reasonable to suppose that agents simply try to do as well as they can for themselves at each iteration. This then leads to consideration of a separate game at each iteration, with the pay-offs being the change in the utilities associated with the adjustment of the proposed allocation. We call games with this pay-off local or instantaneous. Both these alternatives have been considered in the literature. Samuelson's initial discussion of the public good problem would seem to be in terms of the former, global, criterion. Hurwicz adopted this approach in his pathbreaking analysis of incentives [6] and most of the rapidly growing literature on the topic has followed this line. On the other hand, Dreze and de la Vallee Poussin [3] and Malinvaud [8] have employed the local or instantaneous game in their analyses of the incentives under their planning procedure for public goods. Use of these different modellings has led to strongly contrasting results. Hurwicz showed that even in the context of simple exchange economies there could not exist a mechanism for selecting individually rational Pareto optima which was incentive compatible in the sense that correct revelation was always a Nash equilibrium in the global game. On the other side, Dreze and de la Vallee Poussin showed that under correct",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a283-292..htm,10.2307/2297051

2222,Review of Economic Studies,Large Economies with Trading Uncertainty,['Douglas Gale'],"1979, vol. 46, issue 2, 319-338",[],"The last ten years have seen a long series of papers published about models of nonWalrasian equilibrium, most of them concerned with ""Keynesian economics"" or "" underemployment equilibrium"" or some such idea. In recent years two approaches have been especially prominent and something like a definitive version of each is now available. (For an excellent, short account of both, see Grandmont (1977, pp. 556-565).) The first of these approaches was started by Clower and developed by Barro-GrossmanBenassy. It has culminated in the concept of what Grandmont (1977, p. 562) calls a Benassy equilibrium. The other approach was begun by Dreze (for non-Keynesian purposes) and adapted to the study of underemployment equilibrium by GrandmontLaroque. The corresponding equilibrium concept is called a Dreze equilibrium by Grandmont (1977, p. 558). The theory of underemployment equilibrium is now quite highly developed so the introduction of yet another model requires some justification. In the old debate between Keynes and the Classical economists, the traditional view was that persistent unemployment was caused by wage rigidities, a proposition denied by Keynes. Since the Keynesian theory is an equilibrium theory, attention focused on the possibility of underemployment equilibrium. If prices adjust in response to excess demand then in order for an economy to be in equilibrium, excess demand must be zero. Then how can there be underemployment in equilibrium? Clearly a different definition of excess demand (different from the Walrasian one, that is) must be used in the definition of equilibrium. In other words, prices are assumed to respond to the stimulus of effective excess demand, not Walrasian excess demand. Then the possibility of underemployment equilibrium amounts to the existence of a state of the economy in which effective excess demand is zero but Walrasian excess demand is not. The issue here is quite a general one: if the economy is regarded as a homeostatic mechanism, do demand and supply signals alone provide enough information to guide the economy to a full employment equilibrium? In the more recent Keynesian literature, underemployment equilibrium is represented as a kind of informational breakdown. The name of Leijonhufvud (1968) in particular is associated with this interpretation. Now, in a Walrasian equilibrium the plans of the agents are consistent so everyone can trade as much as he wants at the prevailing prices. By definition, in a non-Walrasian equilibrium at least one agent cannot trade as much as he wants at the prevailing prices. One way to represent "" informational breakdown "" is to say that although some agents are dissatisfied with their final net trades, this dissatisfaction is not signalled to the market. More precisely, the market observes zero aggregate effective excess demand in spite of the fact that some agents are dissatisfied with their final net trades. Clearly, the definition of effective excess demand or, more generally, of the signals agents transmit to the market, is crucial. The Dreze and Benassy equilibria, developed perhaps with different objectives in view, are not entirely suited to the study of this sort of problem, mainly because of the way in which effective excess demand is defined.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a319-338..htm,10.2307/2297055
2223,Review of Economic Studies,Unemployment Equilibrium with Myopic Complete Information,"['Walter Perrin Heller', 'Ross M. Starr']","1979, vol. 46, issue 2, 339-359",[],"We will demonstrate that unemployment equilibrium can arise (even at Walrasian equilibrium prices) when each non-cooperative optimizing agent has full information about the consequences of his actions.' Agents may be unable to trade all they wish at going market prices because of insufficient demand for goods they want to sell (or insufficient supply for goods they wish to buy). Both in and out of equilibrium, each agent is assumed to know the actual trade possibilities open to him, conditional upon the actions of other agents remaining constant. This degree of information will be called myopic complete information.' Our interest in endowing agents with this much information is that unemployment is less surprising when agents have pessimistic expectations about their trading possibilities. Unemployment in this paper is not due to underestimates (by firms) of demand for output, nor does the presence of unemployment depend on underestimation (by workers) of income. We make the polar assumption that quantities rather than prices adjust when a market does not clear. Later on, we argue that for some plausible disequilibrium dynamics, there is no pressure on prices at some equilibria. We also exhibit examples of unemployment equilibrium at Walrasian equilibrium prices. Thus, unemployment is not merely the result of rigid prices set at the "" wrong "" levels. Studies of unemployment equilibrium face a persistent difficulty in specifying the character of individual optimization. The sticky points include (i) whether quantity constraints on individual purchases and sales implied by the failure of markets to clear are taken as rigid or subject to manipulation by agents' actions; (ii) whether the quantity constraints and the more conventional budget and non-negativity constraints apply to agents' offers (which may not be fulfilled) or to realized trades; (iii) whether offers (which may not be realized) to trade a commodity represent an optimization with respect to that commodity alone (a partial disequilibrium calculation) or an optimization with respect to all goods (general disequilibrium). The view we take in the present study is that budget and nonnegativity constraints apply directly only to actual trades, not to offers. Agents in the market have a rather good idea of what trade will be realized from offers they make. Offers are made after calculation with respect to all markets at once. That is, an offer for a good is made in light of other offers for its substitutes, complements, and other goods (if any) related to it through preferences or the allocation mechanism. Several authors have demonstrated the existence of unemployment equilibrium in a decentralized economy with optimizing agents (Glustoff (1968), Benassy (1975), Dreze (1975), Grandmont-Laroque (1976), and Hahn (1978)).

2224,Review of Economic Studies,Temporary Equilibria with Quantity Rationing,"['Volker Böhm', 'Pierre Lévine']","1979, vol. 46, issue 2, 361-377",[],"Quantity rationing as a means to determine actual net trades has recently received wide interest in the study of economic situations in which desired net trades of all agents are not compatible. The necessity of defining a list of additional constraints for all agents or of introducing explicit rationing schemes has become apparent particularly in the theory of temporary equilibrium analysis where it is assumed that prices are fixed in the short run. With rationing it is then possible to describe and analyse typical short run disequilibrium phenomena.' Two basic models with quantity rationing have been analysed in the literature. Dreze (1975) provided a solution to the problem of existence of equilibria in an exchange economy where price flexibility was restricted to some a-priori given intervals, including the case of completely rigid prices. Quantity constraints on net trades are taken to be observed and respected by the agents concerned and taken into account in their determination of optimal consumption plans. At equilibrium each consumer maximizes his utility subject to his budget constraints and to the quantity constraints.2 This model assumes that each individual agent has no influence on the outcome of the rationing. For some markets this assumption is not very reasonable. A typical example is the rationing sometimes used by banks in case of an oversubscription for notes of obligation where people are served according to their relative share of the total bid. Then an individual agent might also find it in his interest to manipulate the outcome in his favour by expressing a demand which he knows he will never realize. A similar phenomenon can be observed in labour markets. In either case such dependence leads directly to a revision of the equilibrium concept proposed by Dreze since an agent's maximization against a fixed perceived constraint is no longer his best possible action. The second model was proposed by Benassy (1975). Although Benassy introduces rationing functions for which the actual rationing on each market depends explicitly on each agent's decision in the market, he assumes that for every agent the expressed net trade on each market is a best decision given an agent's subjective rationing function usually different from the actual rationing mechanism. At equilibrium an agent's expressed net trade may be neither a best strategy against the perceived and realized constraints nor may it be optimal exploiting his influence on his effective constraints. These difficulties have lead us to a general reformulation of the equilibrium concept when a fixed rationing scheme is in operation. Apart from some general characteristics of the class of rationing schemes which we consider we do not supply a general theory of rationing schemes. The restrictions are the same as those introduced by Benassy (1975).",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a361-377..htm,10.2307/2297057

In particular, such real effects may exist if inflation is predicted only in the aggregate, while relative prices are allowed to vary randomly. Under such circumstances, firms will find it profitable to inform customers about their specific prices and, consequently, it will become costly to change these prices continuously. We adopt a micro, partial equilibrium approach, and consider a single firm which operates under inflationary expectations. The firm possesses a monopoly power which allows it to set the nominal price of its output or, alternatively, the price of one of its inputs. There are (non-convex) costs of adjustment associated with varying nominal prices. As a result, the firm will change nominal prices by discrete jumps, allowing real prices and output to vary continuously within repeated intervals of time over which the nominal price is held fixed. Clearly, the change in output need not imply a corresponding change in all inputs. Some inputs, such as the hours of work of the existing labour force, are flexible and will vary between successive price changes. Others, such as physical capital and employment, may be costly to vary continuously and will consequently be fixed over such intervals. The analysis starts with the case in which the time interval between price changes is predetermined. This assumption is intended to capture lags in the adjustment of institutional arrangements, such as the duration of labour contracts, when the rate of inflation changes (see Friedman (1977, pp. 464-468)). The main question which we address is the effect of changes in the expected rate of inflation on the demand for fixed factors. We provide a characterization of the forces which determine this relation. Two distinct effects are identified: first, the average complementarity between the fixed intputs and the initial real price during the period in which nominal price is fixed; second, the relative speed at which the marginal profitability of the fixed factor and of the initial price vary over the same interval. We present three models of costs of price adjustments: a monopoly and two types of a monopsony with respect to variable inputs. Under quite standard assumptions, namely constant elasticity demand and production functions, it is shown that the employment of fixed factors is reduced when an increase in the rate of inflation is expected. This result, however, is not necessary, as shown by another example based on linear demand functions. There is an intuitive explanation for this ambiguity. Increased inflationary expectations will induce the firm to choose a higher initial nominal and real price in each period. Due to the higher rate of inflation, real price fluctuations are amplified. It is, in general, not",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a31-45..htm,10.2307/2297170

This paper characterizes optimal extraction from a resource stock of uncertain size and examines the value of information about the size of the stock assuming costs and social preferences are known. Section 2 describes a method for determining the optimal extraction programme when there are no opportunities for exploration or storage of the resource. The model is an extension of the "" cake-eating "" problem analysed by Koopmans (1973) under conditions of certainty. Given fairly typical assumptions, the optimal rate of extraction when the resource stock is uncertain is less than the optimal rate for the expected value of the stock. That is, uncertainty implies a more conservative extraction policy. Exploration provides information about the cost and location of resource deposits and improves estimates of the total size of the resource endowment. The former aspect of exploration is discussed in Gilbert (1976). By specifying the efficient extraction programme conditional on a particular information structure, the analysis in Section 2 sets the stage for determining the value of exploration information about the size of the stock. This is the subject of Section 3. Conditions are derived that are necessary for efficient investment in exploration information. In particular, we show that if storage costs are negligible or if the marginal value of the resource is unbounded, it is always optimal to invest in exploration in order to maintain a stock of known reserves.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a47-57..htm,10.2307/2297171
2229,Review of Economic Studies,Optimal Population and Capital over Time: The Maximin Perspective,['Guillermo Calvo'],"1979, vol. 46, issue 1, 59-71",[],"A well-known implication of the Solow-Swan growth model with non-overlapping generations is that if individuals do not care about the number or well-being of their descendants, the present generation will gain nothing from having children (see Phelps (1966)). The non-overlapping assumption is quite crucial for such a result. Consider instead the case where generations overlap in Samuelson-Diamond fashion (Diamond (1965)), i.e. individuals live for two periods-they work in the first and retire in the second. At present, period zero, there are, therefore, two generations alive, one of which is old and the other which is young and will survive until the end of the next period. Again, the old at time zero do not, in principle, benefit from future generations but that is no longer true for the young at time zero because their capital will be operated by the young in period one. In a competitive environment, for instance, with no childbearing costs and positive crosspartial derivatives between capital and labour, the utility of the young at time zero never decreases by adding one more member to generation 1, i.e. the set of individuals born in period one, because ceteris paribus the rate of return on capital in period one also goes up. It is clear that we must adopt some allocation rule in order to be able to be more specific about the number of children that present generations must have if they want to maximize their utility. In this paper I will examine the case where present and future generations are constrained to be "" fair "", in the sense of the Rawlsian maximin, to every individual who lives or is going to live during any subinterval of the planning period (stretching from zero to the indefinite future) under the assumption that it is possible to allocate consumpcion freely among individuals subject only to the technological constraints. Consequently, we are going to be looking at a typical problem of a central planning agency when its objective is to maximize the welfare of present generations but it is constrained to abide by the dictates of the maximin principle. The present approach, with its emphasis on the welfare of the living generations, is by no means typical of the optimal population literature, most of which is instead concerned with the maximization of a sum of utilities (see, e.g. Meade (1955), Dasgupta (1969, 1974), Pitchford (1972)). This objective may very well imply sacrificing present generations' utilities in favour of the future ones. Consider, for instance, the Meade-Dasgupta maximand (see Meade (1955), Dasgupta (1969)), consisting of a discounted or undiscounted sum of utilities weighted by the number of individuals in each generation. As shown by Dasgupta (1969), it is possible to find conditions under which, in the Solow-Swan model with non-overlapping generations, it would be optimal (according to his criterion) to have positive population at every point in time, implying that present generations would have to refrain from consuming all the available capital. Therefore, in a Dasgupta optimal plan the present generation is worse off than it would be if it had no descendants and ate up all",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a59-71..htm,10.2307/2297172

2231,Review of Economic Studies,Labour Supply and Progressive Taxes,"['T. J. Wales', 'Alan Woodland']","1979, vol. 46, issue 1, 83-95",[],"There are many studies in the literature involving the estimation of labour supply curves for individuals or families (Leuthold (1968), Kosters (1969), Christensen (1972), Hall (1973), Wales (1973, 1976), Wales and Woodland (1976, 1977)). Although most of these rely on the assumption of utility maximizing behaviour in their theoretical discussions, the empirical work is often based on an ad-hoc (often linear) reduced form equation relating hours of work to various determinants, such as the gross wage rate, non-labour income and socioeconomic variables. In some of these studies, however, the assumption of utility maximization carries through to the empirical work, resulting in a labour supply equation derived explicitly from a utility function (Leuthold (1968), Christensen (1972), Wales (1973, 1976), Wales and Woodland (1976, 1977)). At the macro level, on the other hand, there are many studies which explicitly use the utility function approach (Christensen (1968), Diewert (1974), Darrough (1975), Kiefer (1975), Abbott and Ashenfelter (1976), Donovan (1977)). Typically the treatment of taxes in empirical labour supply studies has been inadequate. Indeed in many cases information on taxes has not been available and consequently taxes have been ignored completely. When data are available the question arises of how to treat the piecewise-linear budget constraint implied by the progressive tax system. Several authors (Diewert (1971), Hall (1973), Wales (1973, 1976), Wales and Woodland (1976, 1977)) have proposed approximating this piecewise-linear constraint with a linear constraint passing through the observed point, thus yielding a net or after-tax wage rate to be used in place of the gross wage rate in the analysis. Although this procedure is appropriate for the non-stochastic case it introduces two problems in the stochastic case. First, the observed net wage rate that appears as an explanatory variable in the labour supply function is itself endogenous since it depends on the number of hours worked and is therefore correlated with the disturbance term. This endogeneity must be taken into account to avoid obtaining inconsistent estimates of the parameters.' The second problem involves a specification error. The basic difficulty is that although an individual may be observed to be on a given segment of a piecewise-linear constraint, this observed position is the sum of two components-his utility maximizing position plus a random disturbance. Hence it is entirely possible (particularly if the disturbances are large) that the individual's utility maximizing position may be on a segment of the piecewiselinear constraint other than the observed one. In this case the net after-tax wage rate that should be used in the labour supply equation is the one corresponding to the utility maximizing point, and not the observed one. Thus if the observed net wage rate is used in the estimation then for some individuals the appropriate net wage rate is measured with error while for others it is not. Further it is possible that an individual's utility maximizing position may be at one of the corners of the piecewise-linear constraint, rather than in the interior of a segment.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a83-95..htm,10.2307/2297174

Polemarchakis'],"1979, vol. 46, issue 1, 97-108",[],"In a Walrasian economy, differences among agents in their attitudes towards risk do not constitute an inducement to trade. This is an outcome of the assumption of existence of a complete system of markets in contingent commodities.1 The assumption is, however, empirically unjustified. It is this observation that underlies the "" implicit contract"" theory of employment introduced by Baily (1974) and Azariadis (1975) and further elaborated by Baily (1975), Sargent (1975), Feldstein (1976), Negishi (1976) and Varian (1976). The assumptions and conclusions of the implicit contract theory can be briefly summarized as follows: It is assumed that a firm has a certain pool of workers "" associated "" with it and faces an uncertain price for its output. It is further postulated that the firm's objective function is the expected value of its profits, while workers desire to maximize the expected utility of their income, the latter characterized by risk aversion. The firm chooses the employment contract which maximizes its expected profit subject to the constraint that it provide the workers with a minimum of expected utility. The latter is supposed to reflect the opportunities open for workers elsewhere in the economy. Under these assumptions it can be demonstrated that the optimal contract involves full employment of the firm's labour pool at all states of nature, and a constant wage rate-i.e. a wage rate independent of the contingency realized. The above formulation involves a number of conceptual and empirical problems: It is assumed there is unanimity concerning the probability of occurrence of the various states of nature. Furthermore, not only are workers identical, but firms know the exact form of their utility function. The argument depends crucially on the risk neutrality of firms. In the absence of markets for contingent securities this assumption can only be justified in the very special case of perfect negative correlation between the profits of different firms. Otherwise one has to rely either on the superiority of firms vis-a-vis workers concerning the accessibility to capital markets, or in some Knightian distinction between the innate risk neutrality of entrepreneurs and risk aversion of workers. Workers are assumed to have an indirect utility function separable in income and prices. If this is not the case, even though firms behave parametrically with respect to the prices of goods, they must take into account portfolio-theoretic considerations on the part of workers. Since the only constraint faced by a firm is that the expected utility provided by the contract it offers be greater than or equal to some competitively determined level, it is implicitly assumed that workers cannot abandon the firm after the state of nature has been realized. Equivalently, the costs of movement for workers past the initial contracting period are assumed to be infinitely high. For otherwise, the constraints faced by a firm would take the form of a minimum wage to be paid at each state of nature. In the extreme case of costless labour mobility, this implies that firms are wage takers in the labour market.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a97-108..htm,10.2307/2297175

2234,Review of Economic Studies,The Determinants of Teacher Supply,['Antoni Zabalza'],"1979, vol. 46, issue 1, 131-147",[],"In the economic literature, occupational choice has been interpreted as a decision which will be determined by the expected lifetime earnings associated with each of the available alternatives. Despite its apparent simplicity, it has been notoriously difficult to incorporate this idea into the analysis of occupational choice, the main reason being the inadequacy of empirical data on earnings. Given this difficulty, some models of occupational choice have from the outset formulated the problem as a one-period decision. All the work carried out in the US to investigate the factors determining the choice of a military career belongs to this class of models (cf. Fisher (1969), Altman (1969) and Altman and Barro (1971)). Other researchers have taken into account the effect of lifetime earnings in their theoretical analysis, but have focused their empirical work more on evaluating rates of return than on estimating supply elasticities (e.g. Weiss (1972)). Probably the most complete attempt to deal with this problem has been that of Freeman (1971). The bulk of his empirical analysis considers either starting or average salaries as the relevant variables of the occupational supply functions, and in this sense it is not substantially different from the studies on military manpower reported above. In his analysis of career decisions of doctorate manpower, however, he explicitly takes into account lifetime earnings as the explanatory variable of occupational choices. For each of the specialities considered, Freeman estimates discounted lifetime earnings on the basis of geometric mean incomes for graduates in several previous classes. However, he is faced with serious problems to arrive at a similar measure for alternative occupations. Although still consistent with theoretical expectations, his results are not as neat and convincing as those obtained with only starting or average salaries, and in subsequent work (Freeman (1975a) and (1975b)) he has abandoned this line of analysis, to come back to the simpler specifications. In our view, the analysis of occupational choice developed in this paper goes some way towards the solution of these persistent difficulties. The effect of lifetime earnings on occupational decisions is explicitly considered in a theoretical model from which we derive empirically testable hypotheses. The basic idea is to reduce the earnings profile to two dimensions: its level and the rate at which earnings progress over time. In this manner we achieve two results. First, by measuring the profile with two variables rather than one (as is in fact done when only average, or starting salaries, or even present values, are used), we are able to disentangle two different supply responses: the response to starting earnings, and the response to future earnings prospects. This procedure gives considerable insight into the behaviour of groups of individuals with different characteristics (e.g. men and women). Secondly, our model suggests an empirically convenient way of taking into account lifetime earnings which relies only on starting and average salaries. Given the inadequate data with which most occupational studies have to work, this procedure may prove a useful methodological advance in this area. The rest of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we develop a simple model of occupational choice, which will help in organizing the discussion of the factors that determine the supply of teachers. Then, in Section 3, the model is applied to data on entry and wastage of teachers. Finally, Section 4 summarizes the main results obtained.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a131-147..htm,10.2307/2297177

Several economists soon discovered, however, that the original Tobin model, as well as some of its interpretations, was unstable, and thus useless to the policymaker. In 1971 Hadjimichalakis (1971a), (1971b) examined the reasons which are responsible for the instability of the Tobin growth model. In particular, he found that the Tobin stipulation that the markets are cleared and expectations are fulfilled in each period of time rendered the short run model unstable; moreover this same stipulation was sufficient for long run (growth) instability. The Generalized Tobin Model was introduced in Hadjimichalakis (1971a) in an attempt not only to identify the reasons for the observed instability but also to remedy this instability. This model is captured by the following system of three differential equations, as in Hadjimichalakis (1971a, p. 469): k = sf(k)-(1-s)(0-q)m-nk ...(la) m = m{O-s[m-L(k, q)]-n} ...(lb)",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a46_3ay_3a1979_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a175-178..htm,10.2307/2297180
2238,Review of Economic Studies,The Balance of Trade in a Model of Temporary Equilibrium with Rationing,['Avinash Dixit'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 3, 393-404",[],"The importance of accepting the failure of prices to adjust to their Walrasian equilibrium levels instantaneously is now widely recognized. When economic activity is attempted at such sticky prices, it is the adjustment of quantities that leads to a short run or temporary equilibrium. The first effect is that in any market where the price fails to adjust, the "" short "" side of the market determines the actual amount transacted, and the "" long "" side is rationed. But even more important are the repercussions that arise as transactors who have failed to satisfy their initial demands or supplies in one market recalculate their actions in other markets. This is Clower's dual decision hypothesis, which leads to a distinction between such recalculated or effective demands or supplies and the original or notional ones. The nature of the initial market imbalance depends on the values taken by the sticky prices, and the resulting temporary equilibria with rationing are of different kinds. Recent years have produced some models of closed economies based on this approach. In particular, Barro and Grossman (1976) and Malinvaud (1977) have completed the classification of possible equilibria in a model with labour, aggregate output and fiat money. They divide the wage-price space into regions corresponding to three kinds of equilibria. In the first region the real wage is too high, and consumers face rationing both when buying commodities and when selling labour; this is labelled the region of classical unemployment. The second region has Keynesian unemployment in the sense that there is excess supply in both the commodity and the labour market. The third region has excess demand in both markets, and corresponds to repressed inflation. In these two cases, the real balance effect on demand is an important force. These developments have not so far touched international trade theory. The conventional approach embodied in the diagrams of Swan (1963) and Mundell (1968) is a simple income-expenditure one. It largely neglects wages and prices, and assumes output to be demand-determined. This is a poor choice theoretic framework. It is at best an ad-hoc way of approaching effective demand-determined or Keynesian equilibria, but is quite inappropriate for the other kinds. The work of Meade (1951), from which this approach can be said to derive, pays more attention to some prices, but still falls short of giving a proper logical account of the dual decision process. On the other hand, the monetary approach which has recently come into prominence following Frenkel and Johnson (1976), while paying more attention to prices and choices, usually goes to the other extreme and assumes instantaneous attainment of Walrasian equilibrium in commodity and labour markets. An exception is Rodriguez's paper in that volume, but he admits labour market disequilibrium simply by replacing that component of the standard monetary model by an income-expenditure one. This brings in the attendant flaws mentioned above. This paper is a first attempt at giving a more satisfactory model of the balance of trade,",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a393-404..htm,10.2307/2297242

2240,Review of Economic Studies,Intermediation with Costly Bilateral Exchange,['Robert M. Townsend'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 3, 417-425",[],"This paper was motivated in part by questions of optimal regulation of financial institutions such as intermediaries. It is believed that an analysis of such questions should take place in a model in which financial institutions emerge endogenously as the choice of agents of the model. Yet there appear to be few models which explain institutions in this way. The absence of such models is due in part to the acceptance of what are often thought of as necessary conditions for tractable mathematical analysis. In particular, speaking rather loosely, the technologies of production and exchange are usually assumed to be convex. This is true of the standard competitive model as described for example in ArrowHahn (1971). It is also true of recent attempts to obtain a theory of more limited exchange as in Foley (1970), Hahn (1971) and Kurz (1974). In these analyses convexity is used in establishing the continuity of choice functions upon which standard fixed point theorems rely. Yet, to repeat, convexity prevents the models from explaining specialization. There have been several attempts to weaken the convexity assumptions. In Starr (1969) and in Arrow-Hahn (1971) non-convex sets are replaced by their convex hulls, standard existence theorems are applied to the convexified economy, and the excess demands of the resulting social-approximate equilibrium are then shown to have limit zero as the number of agents is increased. The thrust of this work is that the competitive equilibrium is a good approximation for non-convex economies with a large number of agents. This approach has been modified somewhat by Heller (1972) and by Heller and Starr (forthcoming) to allow for various strong non-convexities associated with set-up costs and to explain the use of money. This paper proposes a simple theory of intermediation and, in contrast to the literature described above, circumvents the difficulties associated with non-convex technologies by a game theoretic approach. A model is described in which exchange is motivated by risksharing considerations. But exchange is also resource using; for each bilateral deal there is a fixed cost. This creates the non-convexity.' Then, having specified the set of agents, their preferences and the technology available to them, core allocations are characterized. As noted by Shapley and Shubik (1966), core allocations are in some sense socially stable; one might expect to observe institutions and exchange arrangements which support such allocations.2 Indeed, a non-cooperative game is proposed for the model, and it is shown that the equilibrium allocations of the game are equivalent to core allocations. In this non-cooperative game agents announce strategies under which they are willing to act as intermediaries, buying shares in investment projects and selling shares in the resulting portfolio. In an equilibrium only a subset of agents act as intermediaries, and in this sense the model may be said to explain specialization. These intermediaries emerge endogenously because they are able to economize on the fixed cost of exchange. The game theoretic approach adopted here also enables one to dispense with the Walrasian auctioneer. Agents of the model propose the exchange arrangements. Moreover the strategies of active intermediaries may include per unit prices with fixed fees or a",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a417-425..htm,10.2307/2297244

2243,Review of Economic Studies,Optimal Redundancy Compensation,['A. A. Sampson'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 3, 447-452",[],"The potential welfare gain arising from a redundancy is the increase in the value of output as the worker is compelled to change jobs. The Redundancy Payments Act scheme is an example of a compensation mechanism whereby the gainers compensate the losers. The evidence of Daniel (1974) suggests that the scheme is inadequate, and Pengilly (1975) proposed an alternative income-maintenance scheme. Both schemes, like the one considered below, consist of a lump-sum payment, plus a time-path of earnings-related unemployment pay. We define an optimal compensation scheme as one that maintains the expected lifetime utility of a worker at the level he would have enjoyed without redundancy, at the lowest expected cost. A worker's expected lifetime utility may fall when he loses his job because of an increase in risk as well as a lower present value of future earnings. Offset against this may be change in the expected amount of leisure. The cost of the scheme equals the lump-sum payment, plus the expected value of unemployment pay over his working lifetime, less the expected value of income-tax payments by the worker. These expectations depend on the probability that a worker will be employed at each subsequent time, and the expected value of his wage at each time. These in turn depend on the frequency distribution of wage offers open to the worker, and the time-path of his acceptance wage. Unemployment pay may be a cheaper method of maintaining expected lifetime utility because it will be paid as, and when, his income without compensation is lower. A lump-sum payment, by increasing the probability that the worker will be in a job at each subsequent time, may reduce the expected value of unemployment pay and increase the expected value of tax receipts. We find that unemployment pay should be positive, but fall over time. A lump-sum payment in addition will be optimal if the wage currently earned by the worker is so high that the probability of his obtaining a job at a very much higher wage is low, and if the income-tax rate is high.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a447-452..htm,10.2307/2297247

While there is evidence that ex-post substitution between factors occurs, it does not invalidate the model. The model appears to be equally valid in energy-intensive and in labor-intensive industries. Labor-saving technical progress is universal and embodied and there is evidence that fuel-saving technical progress is embodied. The ex-ante production function generally yields well-defined output elasticities, but few price elasticities. The theoretical model's failure cannot be assigned to either inappropriateness or inadequate empirical application. The overall impression is that substitution effects are generally weak, although there is some evidence of substitution between solid and liquid fuels. The results obtained using the vintage model tend to confirm those using separate log-linear functions in that both models exhibit strong output effects and weak price effects. The simpler models may be adequate for forecasting, but the putty-clay model yields more insight into the nature of the productive process. 35 references.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a479-494..htm,10.2307/2297250

In particular, for processes making production constraint is the hedonic price function. Such constraints involve economic as well as technical factors that may make them unstable. Preliminary analysis of the price function for the U.S. steam-electric generating industry indicates poor substitution opportunities at the plant level between equipment, fuel, and labor. Economies of scale in capital costs, using a non-substitution model, are found to be small with respect to plant size, while economies of fuel are large in respect to unit size and economies of scale in labor are substantial for all plant sizes. All the observed improvement in fuel efficiency appears to be due to economies of scale. The number of men required to operate a plant of given size, conversely, has declined steadily. The hedonic price index based on the price function indicates that existing conventional price indices have grossly overestimated the increase in the price of capital equipment as a result of failing to make adequate allowance for quality change. 16 references.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a495-510..htm,10.2307/2297251

Hulten'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 3, 511-518",[],"accumulation of capital in an earlier paper, and the adjustment is found nearly to double the importance of technical progress as a source of growth.3 The present paper studies the interaction of productivity change and intermediate input.4 The expansion in the production of intermediate goods occurring because of increased factor efficiency makes it important to distinguish between productivity change originating in a sector and the impact of productivity change on the sector. Productivity change in the first sense refers to the shift in the sectoral technology and is measured by the conventional productivity residual. Productivity change in the second sense measures the equilibrium response to the shifting sectoral technologies, and includes (a) the induced reallocation of factor input between sectors, and (b) the induced expansion in intermediate input, which serves to magnify the effect of technical change. In assessing the importance of productivity change as a source of growth, it is the second sense which is relevant, since it is the impact of productivity change which affects the evolution of the sector, and not the change in factor efficiency occurring within that sector. The distinction between the two aspects of productivity change is analogous to the distinction between nominal and effective tax incidence. An ad-valorem excise tax imposed at a given statutory rate may be regarded as shifting the commodity supply curve upward; the distributional impact of the tax depends on the equilibrium adjustment to this shift. The well-known Harberger (1962) model of tax incidence was, in fact, specifically intended to take these adjustments into account. In an essentially parallel vein, this paper develops the distinction between nominal and effective rates of technical change from the point of view of productivity analysis. Effective rates of productivity change are defined in this paper using the reduced form of an N-sector growth model, where the rate of change of total factor supply, and the rate of change of technological efficiency are assumed to be given exogenously. The growth rates of the endogenous variables-prices and quantities-are expressed as linear combinations 511",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a511-518..htm,10.2307/2297252
2249,Review of Economic Studies,Ownership Concentration and Market Power in Urban Land Markets,"['James Markusen', 'David T. Scheffman']","1978, vol. 45, issue 3, 519-526",[],"In many North American cities the recent period of inflation has been accompanied by a very rapid increase in land prices, resulting in a significant increase in the relative price of housing.' One of the popular targets for "" blame "" for this phenomenon is large developers and landowners who have been accused of restricting development and raising prices for their own gain. However, an adequate analysis of the determinants and consequences of the existence of market power in urban land markets cannot be found in the urban literature, where competitive conditions are assumed to prevail. In this paper we develop a theoretical analysis of the effect of concentration of ownership on the allocation of resources in urban land markets, focusing on the relationship between market structure and the spatial distribution of occupancy and land prices in an urban area. We will show that because of the spatial heterogeneity of land, a natural entry barrier exists which implies that concentrated ownership always confers potential market power on large landowners, and that exercised market power necessarily distorts the spatial distribution of occupancy and land prices. In particular, we show that leapfrog development is one possible result of exercised market power, providing a possible explanation for this common urban phenomenon. 1. THE MODEL We will use a model of a circular city which is adapted from Solow's version (1973) of the standard urban location model. Since we wish to examine the relationship between concentration, per se, and market power, we will assume that there is an arbitrarily large amount of homogeneous land so that there are no "" entry "" barriers resulting from limited supplies of specialized land. For simplicity, we will assume the Central Business District (CBD) is a circular region of fixed size with radius R. We will ignore the production aspect of the CBD other than to assume a composite consumption good and composite housing good are produced. The consumption good is produced by a perfectly competitive industry at constant costs. The composite housing good, also produced by a perfectly competitive industry, is a flow of housing serviceg consisting of housing and land in fixed proportions, so that the housing composite is measured by lot size. The supply price of a unit of housing services at distance x from the CBD, excluding the cost of land, is C(x), where C'(x) > 0. Thus C(x) includes the cost of providing and maintaining serviced land and housing at distance x from the CBD, but not the (rental) cost of the raw land. With no loss in generality, we assume that land outside the CBD has no economic use other than for housing. Households thus consume a single composite consumption good and a composite",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a519-526..htm,10.2307/2297253
2250,Review of Economic Studies,"Information, Managerial Choice and Stockholder Unanimity",['Hayne Leland'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 3, 527-534",[],"Stockholder unanimity plays a key role in the theory of production. Under certainty, profit maximization is justified as being in the interest of all stockholders. But the introduction of uncertainty renders profit maximization meaningless, since production decisions do not give rise to a unique level of profits. A fundamental question is whether stockholders with diverse expectations and attitudes towards risk will support unanimously a particular set of production decisions. Without unanimity, firms' decisions will depend upon the weighting of diverse stockholder and managerial preferences, with the possible non-existence of a preference ordering over actions by the firm.' And without a theory of the firm, a substantial fraction of positive economics disappears. Several recent papers have studied the relationship between financial markets and production under uncertainty. Implicitly or explicitly, stockholder unanimity has been a property of these models. Two sets of conditions have resulted in stockholder unanimity. The first set, studied by Wilson (1968) and Rubinstein (1974), requires identical investor expectations and tastes belonging to the linear risk tolerance class of utility functions. The second set of conditions requires the space of returns generated by marketed securities to contain the marginal returns resulting from small changes in the firms' decisions. Ekern and Wilson (1974) showed that spanning was a sufficient condition for "" ex-post "" unanimity. Leland (1973) showed it was necessary as well, and showed that, with an additional competitive price assumption, spanning assured "" ex-ante"" stockholder unanimity.2 A number of economic environments are consistent with the spanning property, including the "" complete markets"" models of Arrow (1964) and Debreu (1959), and the incomplete markets models of Diamond (1967), Leland (1974, 1975), and Forsythe (1975). While providing a class of environments consistent with stockholder unanimity, both sets of conditions seem overly restrictive. Individuals possess different information and different expectations. And investment projects or other decisions resulting in marginal changes in returns typically have project-specific risks which are not spanned by currently marketed securities. Furthermore, the two sets of conditions consistent with unanimity give little scope to the role of the manager. Clearly managers cannot have "" better information "" than investors if expectations are identical. And wvhile spanning permits different expectations, the optimal decisions by the firm will be independent of any particular set of expectations, including those of the manager. Why should a manager gather information if (as these models predict) better decisions will not result? In short, current approaches to stockholder unanimity are inconsistent with the fact that managers typically have (and are urged to obtain) better information about firm-specific risks. While informational asymmetry has been considered in models of principal-agent and hierarchical relationships (Ross (1973), Mirrlees (1976)), it has not been considered in models where there are multiple stockholders (principals) with divergent tastes and expectations.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a527-534..htm,10.2307/2297254

2256,Review of Economic Studies,Arbitration of Two-party Disputes under Uncertainty,['Robert Rosenthal'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 3, 595-604",[],"One may view the task of an arbitrator to be the selection of a single, fair, Pareto optimal outcome of a game. This task may be especially difficult if the arbitrator lacks crucial information about the structure of the game or the preferences of its players. In addition to the mechanical problems associated with information gathering, there may arise situations in which the arbitrator must rely on the players themselves to provide certain information. If the players can predict the effect of their responses on the arbitrator's selection, they may have incentives to provide false information. The purpose of this paper is to explore the effects of possible courses of action which the arbitrator may pursue in such situations. The bulk of the game-theoretic literature on bargaining and arbitration assumes complete information about the game. In Harsanyi and Selten (1972) a model of bargaining was first introduced in which the two players possessed incomplete information about the game. Subsequently, Kalai and Rosenthal (forthcoming) treated a situation in which the two players possessed complete information and the arbitrator was ignorant. They showed that the arbitrator could create incentives for truth-telling by using each player's report as a check on the other's report and by severely punishing both players in the case of conflicting reports. This scheme relies very heavily on the assumption of complete information on the part of the players. In what follows, we deal with a model for two-party disputes in which all participants (both players and the arbitrator) may possess incomplete information. We examine possible arbitration schemes with respect to three criteria: that truthful revelation should be in equilibrium, that the arbitrated outcome should be Pareto optimal relative to the information available to the players and the arbitrator taken together, and that the arbitrated outcome should be individuaLly rational in the sense that neither player could expect to do better by refusing to submit to binding arbitration. We show that there exist games for which no arbitration scheme can satisfy all three criteria; we provide sufficient conditions under which a scheme similar to that proposed in Kalai and Rosenthal (forthcoming) satisfies all three criteria; and we examine the effects of requiring each set of two of the criteria. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the model and the criteria are specified and discussed. An example is given to illustrate the concepts. In Section 3 an example is presented for which the three criteria are inconsistent. In Section 4 sufficient conditions are established for the consistency of the three criteria. Pairwise combinations of the three criteria are treated in Section 5.

Levy (1973) developed sufficient rules for firstand second-degree dominance when utility functions are defined on terminal wealth and there is independence among outcomes in different periods. Levy and Paroush (1974a, 1974b) extended these results for rules of first degree dominance omitting the requirement of inter-period independence of outcomes. In addition they developed necessary and sufficient rules of first-degree dominance for additive utility functions. Huang et al. (1978) extended all the results in Levy (1973) and the results obtained for additive utility functions in Levy and Paroush (1974b) to all important classes of stochastic dominance. Levhari et al.

Unfortunately, the conditions developed are difficult to verify. In this paper we investigate rules of stochastic dominance for multi-attribute utility functions.

2260,Review of Economic Studies,The Optimal Exploitation of an Unknown Reserve,['Glenn Loury'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 3, 621-636",[],"The general problem of the optimal utilization of scarce natural resources has received considerable recent attention in the literature. Most study has been of the case where the level of the resource available to the economy is known with certainty. In those instances where uncertainty has been explicitly introduced, the focus has been on analysing the effect of the existence of a technologically advanced substitute for the scarce resource which will become available at some unknown future date (Dasgupta and Heal (1974)). The more difficult problem of optimal planning when premature exhaustion is a real possibility due to a lack of precise knowledge about the total supply of the resource has received little attention. (Gilbert (1976) is a notable exception.) This paper begins an investigation of that problem. Any treatment of resource utilization with unknown reserves must confront two rather different issues. The first of these is the possibility of exhaustion. In models where the level of the resource is known with certainty, the exhaustion of an "" essential"" natural resource occurs only asymptotically. When the resource base is of unknown size, however, the date on which it will have been completely exploited is also a random variable. The choice of the rate at which to consume the resource must necessarily be influenced by the effect which the consumption rate has on the probability of exhaustion at subsequent points in time. The second issue is that of learning about the distribution of reserves over time. Even though the level of total reserves may be unknown, it must certainly be the case that the activities of exploration and extraction provide information about the distribution of remaining reserves. Moreover, the nature of this information will be influenced by the exploration and extraction decisions which are made along the way. Thus, an optimal programme of extraction should properly balance both consumption and information benefits against extraction and opportunity costs at each point in time. This paper, while treating the first issue with some generality, will take a rather limited view of the way in which information about the distribution of total reserves is assimilated. We shall assume that the planner begins with a given probability distribution of possible endowments of the natural resource, and that he updates this distribution over time by conditioning on the knowledge of his cumulative consumption at each instant. Thus we will abstract from the activity of exploration. This is a regrettable omission which we hope to correct in a later paper. The treatment of this initial problem seems essential to further progress in any event. The plan of the paper is as follows. We begin with a review of the problem of optimal depletion without production in a certain environment. Variational techniques are then employed to deduce necessary conditions for a solution to the problem of optimal exploitation under uncertainty. It is seen that the possibility of premature exhaustion considerably alters the requirements of an optimal path. We then determine a more complete characterization of an optimum and prove a number of qualitative and comparative static results,",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a621-636..htm,10.2307/2297264
2261,Review of Economic Studies,Resource Extraction when a Future Substitute has an Uncertain Cost,['Michael Hoel'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 3, 637-644",[],"In the last few years several economists have treated various aspects of uncertainty in the context of natural resource extraction. In particular, Dasgupta and Heal (1974) and Dasgupta and Stiglitz (1976) have studied cases where a perfect substitute for an exhaustible resource will become available at some future date. Both of these studies assume that this future date is uncertain, but that the characteristics of the substitute, represented by the costs of producing it, are known with certainty. The present paper analyses the opposite case: the date of availability is assumed to be known, but the costs of producing the substitute are uncertain. In Section 2 the model is presented, and Section 3 shows how uncertainty affects the socially optimal resource extraction under various assumptions about the society's risk aversion. In Section 4 the competitive solution is derived and compared with the social optimum, before some concluding comments are given in Section 5. 2. THE MODEL Let x(t) and y(t) be the rate of resource extraction and of production of a perfect substitute, respectively. The date when the substitute will become available, which is known at the time of planning (t = 0) is denoted by T. We shall disregard extraction costs, and denote the unit cost of producing the substitute by c. This cost is not known with certainty at t = 0, but we assume that there exists a probability distribution of c (consisting only of positive values) which all agents in the economy agree upon. No new information about the true value of c becomes available before T, but at T the true value of c is revealed. The social optimization problem is to maximize EW (= the expected value of W), where",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a637-644..htm,10.2307/2297265

Starrett'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 2, 215-227",[],"Problems involving optimal decentralization of decision-making in the presence of nonconvexities have a long, frustrating history. Solutions generally involve evaluation of a surplus term and economists have been unable to discover ways of revealing that term without the collection of hypothetical information. However, certain non-convex problems have additional structure which can be exploited in order partially to circumvent this difficulty. We will focus here on such a problem involving capacity construction. Suppose that we restrict attention to problems involving a single type of capacity (for example, electric power, telephone channels, highway through-put, bridges or dams), and for which the non-convexities are involved in the construction of capacity but not in the production of services from capacity. This class of problems seems fairly broad in scope and has a long history generally associated with the French economists (see Nelson (1964) for a survey). We begin by summarizing the French approach as discussed by Boiteux (Chapter 3 in Nelson, op. cit.). Boiteux discusses the non-convex replacement problem, using railway cars as the paradigm. First, he attempts to apply marginal analysis to the problem of pricing capacity in this situation. Under the usual rules of marginal cost pricing, the price of a ticket should be zero as long as the last car is not full, but should jump up to the marginal cost per person handled of adding an additional car as soon as it is full. Now, if at the zero price demand exceeds the capacity of this car, while at the second it falls short, there is clearly no equilibrium outcome; marginal analysis fails to tell us what to do. Considered in isolation, we are left with the classical non-convexity dilemma: to decide whether or not the extra car is justified, we must compare the cost against the full consumer surplus generated. However, Boiteux notices that the problem should not be considered in isolation.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a215-227..htm,10.2307/2297336

Several sources of uncertainty were examined: uncertainty in preferences, which induces uncertainty in the terms of trade ([12]);1 uncertainty in the terms of trade without reference to more basic causes ([1], [3], [15], [16], [17]); and technological uncertainty ([4], [17]). In some cases, trading commitments were assumed to take place before the resolution of uncertainty ([3], [15]); in other cases, trading commitments were assumed to take place only after the resolution of uncertainty ([1], [3], [4], [12], [16], [17]). However, a common (and crucial) feature of all the models used in the above works is that they did not contain international risk-sharing arrangements. The main conclusion of this body of literature was that the basic theorems of international trade theory (Factor Price Equalization, Stolper-Samuelson, Rybczynski and Specialization According to Comparative Advantage) do not carry over to uncertain environments. In this paper, we develop a different model of international trade under conditions of uncertainty. Its main novelty is that it contains stock markets. The model results from an integration of the theory of international trade with recent developments in the theory of financial markets. (For the latter, see [5], [6], [8], [9], [13].) We show that many of the models used by earlier writers can be interpreted as special cases of our model, if we do not allow international trade in securities. Using this interpretation, we explain why the basic theorems of international trade do not carry over to uncertain environments in the absence of international risk-sharing arrangements (Section 4). Then, we show that the basic theorems of international trade do carry over to uncertain environments if international trade in securities is admitted into the model (Section 5). However, it should be emphasized that the stock market model does not enable perfect risk sharing as do the Arrow-Debreu model of contingent commodities and the model of Arrow-type securities; our model contains incomplete markets rather than complete markets. An economy with a stock market is described in Section 2. In Section 3, we apply the framework of Section 2 to the Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin models, assuming that no international trade in shares is allowed to take place. In Section 4, we discuss the implications of our Section 2 models. In Section 5, we introduce international trade in shares and future markets, and discuss their implications. Finally, in Section 6, we discuss limitations and possible extensions of our work.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a239-250..htm,10.2307/2297338
2265,Review of Economic Studies,Production Flexibility and the Behaviour of the Competitive Firm under Price Uncertainty,['Larry Epstein'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 2, 251-261",[],"There have been numerous studies in the literature of the competitive firm under price uncertainty. Recently, Sandmo [18] and Batra and Ullah [2] have analysed the behaviour of an expected utility maximizing firm which chooses its output level subject to uncertainty about the price that will prevail for its product. Both studies represent increased price uncertainty by a multiplicative shift of the random variable coupled with a translation so as to preserve the mean, and they consider the effect on output of increased product price uncertainty. While Sandmo is unable to sign the effect, Batra and Ullah show that output declines if absolute risk aversion is declining. In both [18] and [2] it is assumed that all decisions must be made ex ante. Turnovsky [19] has extended the model to allow the firm to modify its initial decisions, at additional cost, after it learns the true selling price of its product. He compares initial production when price expectations are certain and when they are uncertain with the same expected value. Hartman ([10] and [12]) has investigated the firm's reactions to increased price uncertainty when the technology permits some ex-post flexibility in adjusting to the prices that are eventually realized. In the former paper Hartman uses a multiperiod model to analyse the effects of future product and factor price uncertainty on the rate of investment in a single capital stock, given that the firm encounters convex adjustment costs in changing the level of its stock. Qualitative results are derived from the hypothesis of constant returns to scale in production. This hypothesis is dropped in the two-period model in [12] which considers a single output, two factor technology.' Capital is a quasi fixed factor and must be chosen ex ante, while the other input, labour, may be chosen after prices become known with certainty. In both studies increased variability is represented by a mean preserving spread (see Rothschild and Stiglitz [16]), and it is generally assumed that the firm maximizes the expected value of profits. In [12], Hartman also compares the capital input given certain price expectations with that in a situation involving a "" small"" amount of uncertainty, assuming that the firm is averse to profit uncertainty. In this paper we modify and generalize the above analyses in three principal ways. First, we adopt the Rothschild-Stiglitz definition of increased uncertainty and show that the findings of both Sandmo and Batra and Ullaht must subsequently be altered. Unlike the other studies, we also investigate the effects of mean utility preserving spreads (see Diamond and Stiglitz [5]). These spreads generate some intuitively appealing comparative statics results. With the exception of a paper by Dhrymes [4] which employs the restrictive meanvariance framework, in other studies, including all of the above, the firm's ex-ante decision variable is a scalar, e.g. the level of production or the input of a quasi-fixed factor. Most of our qualitative results are similarly restricted to aggregative models.

2268,Review of Economic Studies,On the Dynamics of Disequilibrium: A Simple Remark,['Guy Laroque'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 2, 273-278",[],"Recent works in the field of disequilibrium analysis have increased our understanding of the functioning of the economic system when transactions take place at prices that may not achieve the equilibrium of supply and demand as the classics understood it. The works of Benassy [2] and Dreze [4] show us a way of representing the allocation process when prices are assumed to be rigid in the short run, in the context of the "" fixed price method "" of Hicks [5]. The foregoing studies allow us to look at the dynamics of an economy where prices would be fixed at each period, but possibly moving from period to period. In this context, one must search for the dynamic forces which are underlying the disequilibrium allocations. A question of interest is then to ask whether these forces are bound to drive the system towards a Walrasian equilibrium. This note brings a first answer to a part of this general problem. A simple model of an exchange economy with two non-durable commodities is considered. In a neighbourhood of a locally stable Walrasian equilibrium, a result in comparative statics is established: the agents on the short side of the market always prefer the Walrasian allocation to the disequilibrium allocation, while, if trade actually takes place, there exists a disequilibrium allocation which is strictly preferred to the Walrasian allocation by all the agents on the long side of the market. This suggests the following interpretation: if the agents in the economy have a perfect foresight of the dynamic behaviour of the market, in a neighbourhood of any stable Walrasian equilibrium, the dynamics of the system should take the form of a struggle between the buyers and the sellers for the settling of the price. The paper is divided into two sections. In the first one, the results are stated and their economic interpretation is discussed. The second section contains the proofs.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a273-278..htm,10.2307/2297342
2269,Review of Economic Studies,Why the Edgeworth Process Assumption Isn't That Bad,['Paul Madden'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 2, 279-283",[],"A common assumption concerning disequilibrium exchange which has been employed to prove non-tatonnement stability theorems is that such exchange follows an Edgeworth process. One formulation of this assumption is: an exchange takes place if and only if it is feasible at the current set of prices and all parties to the exchange are made better off. This seems to be an innocuous and attractive assumption and so the results it gives rise to on the stability of general equilibrium' appear to be "" powerful and appealing "" [3, p. 18]. However, as Fisher [3, p. 19] has recently observed, there is (at least) one drawback: ""While it is obviously innocuous to assume that individuals will not trade unless they can better themselves by so doing, it is not nearly so simple to assume that trade actually will take place whenever such a situation arises. This is because of the possibility that the only coalitions which can better themselves by mutual trade consist of very large numbers of people. Thus it is possible that there is no mutually advantageous bilateral or trilateral or quadrilateral trade and that the only mutually advantageous trade involves a very complicated swapping of commodities among millions of people. To require as the Edgeworth process assumption does that such a trade must take place is to put very heavy requirements on the dissemination of information and to assume away the costs of coalition formation."" Things are not quite that bad though, for as Fisher goes on to report: "" David Schmeidler has shown (in an unpublished communication) that if there is any mutually advantageous trade there is one involving at most the same number of participants as there are commodities"" [3, p. 19]. A proof of this theorem is provided below (Theorem 1). However, this result is inadequate to overcome the Fisher criticism of the Edgeworth process assumption. For it is of no help at all when there are more commodities than agents in the economy. Also it shows the sufficiency of bilateral trading (which causal empiricism suggests to be the norm) for only the highly restricted set of economies in which there are just two commodities. It would thus be of interest to know whether there exist interesting assumptions which imply the sufficiency of bilateral trade for the execution of Edgeworth process type exchange (hereafter Edgeworth exchange). It turns out (Theorem 2, below) that under assumptions which are anyway implied by assumptions required for the proof of non-tatonnement stability theorems of the Edgeworth process variety, bilateral trading is sufficient in this sense. Precisely, if utility functions are strictly quasi-concave and if there are unique support hyperplanes to indifference surfaces and if endowments are always strictly positive, then if there's an Edgeworth exchange for some set of agents, there's an Edgeworth exchange for some pairs of agents. Thus the Fisher problem disappears. Edgeworth exchange requires only bilateral trades. The results here will come as no surprise to those familiar with the literature which answers the question: How many agents are required to effect a Pareto improving trade (when there are no price restrictions on the admissible trades)? In that context there exist Schmeidler type results [4, 5, 6] and bilateral results [2, 6, 7, 8].

A substantial part of this work has involved the construction and estimation of employment equations the composition of which is derived primarily from an (inverted) short-run production function. The choice of statistical surrogate for employment has strong implications for the structure of the estimating equations and yet, remarkably, relatively little attention has been paid to this aspect of the problem. In most of the studies employment has been approximated either by the number of men in employment or by man-hours. Both formulations assume implicitly that men and average hours are perfect substitutes for one another; that is they are functionally related to the same set of exogenous variables, adjust at an equal rate to their own lagged values and exhibit similar reactions over the cycle to each and every influence. Such assumptions, however, are bold and several writers have seen the need to provide a separate specification for equations depicting the demand for the number of workers and their rate of utilization (see Kuh (1956b), Brechling (1965), Fair (1969), Nadiri and Rosen (1969, 1973) from above and also Brechling (1974) and Ehrenberg (1971)). Three major reasons may be given which would warrant such a separation: (i) Hours may be viewed as comprising the principal short-run means of adjusting labour to output changes while men are adjusted to meet longer-term movements in output, capital stock, etc. (ii) Men and hours may themselves be interdependent (recursively) given the different time scales mentioned above. (iii) Certain exogenous influences may affect the demand for men in different (and possibly opposite) ways from their effect on hours. The main purpose of this paper is to present and test a simple theory which takes explicit account of the interdependence between the employee and utilization decisions. The functional form of our model is developed in Section 2 with particular variable constructions and results presented in Section 3. Where possible, it will be interesting to compare our results with those of Brechling (1965) since the early development of our model follows closely along lines suggested by Brechling and, like him, our data refer to British manufacturing industries.

2272,Review of Economic Studies,Aggregation and the Demand for New and Used Automobiles,['Terry R. Johnson'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 2, 311-327",[],"This study is an empirical investigation of the aggregate demand for the services of new and used automobiles in the United States from 1954 to 1972. In almost all previous studies of the automobile market, the heterogeneity of automobiles is ignored, and the studies proceed on the basis of a single aggregate measure of the automobile stock. The only two exceptions are Farrell [2] and Wykoff [14]. The models they used to incorporate differences in the services provided by various cars, however, did not yield satisfactory empirical results. The motivation for our study lies in their unsuccessful attempts to explain used car prices. Farrell considers the market for automobiles to be a set of interrelated markets for a series of close substitutes rather than a single market for a homogeneous commodity. He assumes cars of a particular age to be homogeneous and constructs demand functions for ages one through six. Although his model is interesting, his empirical results are disappointing in that no systematic relations emerge over age. A more recent study by Wykoff separates the automobile market into new and used cars but treats used cars as homogeneous. He finds that new and used car services have distinct price and income elasticities; the income elasticity for new car services appears much larger indicating new car services are superior goods relative to used car services. His estimate of the used car income elasticity, however, is extremely imprecise; in fact, not one of the coefficients in the equation determining the rental price of used cars is statistically significant. Without reliable evidence the superior goods hypothesis remains suspect. In addition to examining the demand for automobile services, it is the purpose of this study to explain the determination of used car rental prices, and test the superior goods hypothesis. In Section 2, two alternative definitions of the implicit rental price are constructed following different assumptions regarding the value of next period's expected price. Relative rental price ratios are interpreted as weights that translate the services of automobiles of different makes and ages into a common numeraire unit in order to obtain various aggregate measures of automobile services. Evidence on whether these weights satisfy the Hicks aggregation criteria is presented. In Section 3, we describe the aggregate demand equations that are to be estimated with each make alternatively as the numeraire. These equations are estimated with different makes as the numeraire in order to provide additional evidence on the question of aggregation. It is shown that the price and income elasticities are unaffected by varying the numeraire if the Hicks aggregation criteria are satisfied.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a311-327..htm,10.2307/2297346
2273,Review of Economic Studies,On the Consistency of Libertarian Claims,['Kotaro Suzumura'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 2, 329-342",[],"If one social state is unanimously preferred to another, it is difficult to argue that the former state should not be socially chosen over the latter and, as a result, the claim that the collective choice rule we are interested in should be Pareto-inclusive has seldom been challenged. It may also be claimed that there are certain matters which are purely personal and our collective choice rule should be so designed that each person is empowered to decide what should be socially chosen, no matter what others may think, in choices over his personal matters. Sen [8] has shown that these two principles conflict, namely, there exists no Pareto-inclusive collective choice rule (with an unrestricted applicability) satisfying a mild libertarian claim. Since the logical correctness of Sen's argument is beyond any doubt, we are forced to weaken either the Pareto rule or the libertarian claim in order to avoid this difficulty, unless we renounce the general applicability of our collective choice procedure. Although many subsequent contributions have modified libertarian claims in favour of the Pareto rule, one of the lessons Sen [8 and 9] has drawn from his Paradox of a Paretian Liberal is that a mechanical use of the Pareto rule (irrespective of the motivation behind people's preferences) seems unsound. In line with this observation, Sen [10, Section XI] has recently proposed a resolution of this paradox which restricts the use of the Pareto rule. We will succinctly reconstruct his resolution with some clarifications of the structure of his rightsassignment (in Section 2) and then show (in Section 3) that one of the Gibbard's paradoxes [4, Section 3] can be solved by essentially the same line of argument. This might be of some importance, because Sen's paradox and that of Gibbard are essentially different in nature. Suffice it to quote a passage from Gibbard [4, p. 394]: "" [Sen's libertarianism] guarantees each person a special voice on only one pair of alternatives, but the special voice is a strong one: the alternative he prefers is to be preferable, no matter what his other preferences. [Gibbard's libertarianism] guarantees each person a special voice on many pairs of alternatives . . . but the voice is limited. The one he prefers is to be preferable if indeed he prefers its distinguishing feature unconditionally; otherwise his preference may be overridden."" In Section 4, we will examine the possibility of introducing information on interpersonal welfare comparisons into the cdnceptual framework. It will be shown that, if the rights-exercising is restricted by the Rawlsian maximin justice consideration (which is now available to us by the stronger informational basis we are working on), the modified libertarian claim is made compatible with the Pareto principle. This is in sharp contrast with Sen's [10, p. 228] assertion that "" for this class of impossibility results, introducing interpersonal comparisons is not much of a cure (in contrast with the impossibility results of the Arrow type) "", which he has drawn from Kelly's [6] Impossibility of a Just Liberal.

The literature contains several reports of the measurement of this consumer's surplus for recreation sites (Clawson (1959), Knetsch (1964) and Merewitz (1966)). A relatively recent refinement in these studies is the inclusion in the price proxy of the monetary value of the time cost (James (1968), Merewitz (1966)). With this modification, the price proxy has become a proxy for what Becker (1965, p. 497) calls "" full price ""; consequently, the recent analyses have estimated consumer's surplus as an area under a "" full price"" demand curve.

In this paper we derive a similar result when full comparability of welfare is permitted, so that both interpersonal evels and units are significant. By characterizing utilitarianism under full comparability, we avoid the somewhat arbitrary informational basis from which the d'Aspremont-Gevers esult is derived (although we are still, of course, open to criticism of interpersonal comparisons in general). Our result also gives a new slant to the contrast between utilitarianism and the lexicographic maximin principle (Rawls' generalized difference principle [6]), which Hammond [4] has characterized under full comparability. In another paper [5], we point out that the theorem is actually an immediate consequence of a proposition from the theory of decision-making under ignorance.

2291,Review of Economic Studies,Some Notes on Time Inconsistency and Rawls' Maximin Criterion,['Guillermo Calvo'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 1, 97-102",[],"In a recent paper Dasgupta [3] has neatly demonstrated that the Rawlsian maximin criterion may be inadequate for problems of intergenerational justice by showing that, under some specific utility functions exhibiting altruism towards future generations, plans which are optimal from the standpoint of a given generation will not be continued by future generations even when the latter are true believers in the virtues of maximin, i.e. time inconsistency would arise. This is undoubtedly an alarming result which, if proved to be a common feature of maximin, would give us sufficient grounds to dismiss it altogether as a principle of intergenerational justice. In this paper we present some results aimed at furthering our understanding of that issue. In Section 2 we analyse the question of whether time inconsistency is possible if we make generations choose between arbitrary pairs of consumption sequences. The answer to that question is a resounding yes; in the presence of altruism-defined in a rather general way which includes as a special case the utility function employed by Dasgupta-not only is it possible to find pairs of consumption sequences where maximin proves to be time inconsistent, but we are able to show that there are infinitely many of them. On this account the results of Dasgupta get further support. In Section 3 we constrain the set of consumption sequences to be feasible according to a neoclassical technology and study time consistency of optimal plans when a generation's utility can be represented by a discounted sum of (instantaneous) utilities. This is akin to the problem analysed by Dasgupta, except that the utility function is changed as indicated above. Here the picture is drastically different: for every relevant initial capital stock, k, there is a time-consistent optimal plan. Furthermore, if k is smaller than, or equal to, Golden-Rule capital the optimum is unique.

2293,Review of Economic Studies,On Revealed Preference Analysis,['Andreu Mas-Colell'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 1, 121-131",[],"In this paper we shall be concerned with the theory of revealed preference understood in its original sense (Samuelson [19]), namely, as a theory of rational consumer's behaviour in competitive market situations; (see Richter [18] for the formulation and development of a general, abstract theory). As with practically all previous work in the field we will focus on the relationship between the theory of demand derived from revealed preference analysis and the one based on preference maximization; we denote the latter theory as the preference hypothesis. In 1938 Samuelson proposed as a new foundation for consumer theory the weak axiom of revealed preference (WA); the WA asserts that if a commodity bundle y is affordable, given a budget at which x is chosen (for short, if x is revealed preferred to y), then y cannot be revealed preferred to x. Although it has turned out that the demand theory implied by the WA is broader than the one generated by the preference hypothesis (Gale [6]; see also, Kihlstrom, Mas-Colell, Sonnenschein [14]) it is clear that they are conceptually close and their relationships were in need of clarification. The decisive step was given in 1951 by Houthakker [10]. He introduced the strong axiom of revealed preference (SA) and convincingly argued its equivalences with the preference hypothesis. Roughly speaking, the SA postulates the cyclical consistence of the WA. Since Houthakker's contribution the main line of research (see, for example, Uzawa [22], Stigum [21], etc.) has concentrated in finding sufficient conditions on demand functions guaranteeing that the consumer acts as a preference maximizer and his preferences are completely "" determined "" by his choice behaviour. This programme calls for both the existence of preferences underlying choice and their uniqueness in some class (usually the class defined by the property of continuity) and it is clear that, to successfully complete it, conditions on demand functions (besides, of course, the SA) will have to be imposed. So far, positive results have been obtained by combining a substantive requirement, the well definiteness of indirect demand functions, with a quite weak regularity one, the income Lipschitz property (this term will be defined later on).",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a121-131..htm,10.2307/2297089
2294,Review of Economic Studies,An Experimental Examination of Two Exchange Institutions,"['Charles Plott', 'Vernon Smith']","1978, vol. 45, issue 1, 133-153",[],"Economists have shown increasing interest in the analysis of information and organization 
in decentralized price adjustment processes. This interest is most frequently manifested 
at the theoretical level (summaries of the relevant literature, concepts, and methodologies 
have been provided by Hurwicz [3] and Rothschild [4]), but it also has found expression 
through several laboratory experimental studies. These latter have unusual appeal because 
they can serve as a ""proving ground"" for the former. If well-formulated theories consistently 
fail to predict simple laboratory behaviour, then one would be hesitant to trust 
their predictions in richer environments. Furthermore, when replicable laboratory 
behaviour can be demonstrated, one should seek those extensions of accepted theory which 
explain why it occurs. 
The laboratory studies have attempted to measure the effect of different forms of 
market organization on the efficiency, performance, convergence pattern and equilibrium 
level of prices. The variables of market organization examined have been the mechanisms 
or rules under which prices are communicated and contracts are executed. The focus on 
these particular variables has been motivated by the more prominent features of certain 
observed exchange institutions rather than formal models based on pre-scientific, casual 
observations of the kind that form the basis of embryonic modelling. We view the present

2295,Review of Economic Studies,"Financial Assets, Non-Traded Goods and Devaluation",['John F. Kyle'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 1, 155-163",[],"In this paper, the effects of a currency depreciation on a small open economy producing both traded and non-traded, or home, goods are examined. Since the analytical framework employed is a general equilibrium model modified to include a financial sector, the study can be seen to be in the tradition of Hahn [3], Kemp [5], [6], Negishi [10], Berglas and Razin [1], Dornbusch [2] and Krueger [7]. However, unlike these earlier contributions, the model employed here incorporates a second financial asset, in addition to money, into the analysis. Since by now it is well known that, in the absence of a policy of complete sterilization, a devaluation can have no permanent effect on the trade balance in the long run (see e.g. Johnson [4]), and since this result obviously carries over to a world of more than one asset, the present study focuses on the short-run effects of an exchange rate change. The emphasis on the short run is readily justified by the fact that there are significant welfare costs to allowing the automatic adjustment mechanism full sway. Moreover, even in the absence of such welfare costs, finite stocks of foreign exchange often necessitate explicit policy measures to correct a trade deficit before natural processes have worked themselves out. The principal conclusion which emerges from the analysis is that most results obtained in earlier studies concerning (1) the ability of a devaluation to improve the trade balance, (2) the symmetry between exchange rate changes and changes in the nominal money supply, and (3) the role of non-traded goods in the adjustment process, are all special cases, valid only in the absence of an alternative financial asset. To facilitate exposition, the analysis is presented in stages. In Section 1 the basic open-economy general equilibrium model with two traded goods and money developed by Hahn [3] is extended to allow for a second financial asset. The impact of changes in various control variables on a small country are then examined. In Section 2 the model is extended to incorporate non-traded goods, and their role in the adjustment process is explored. Section 3 presents an intuitive explanation of the results obtained, and a brief conclusion.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a155-163..htm,10.2307/2297091

A banking firm usually handles, besides credit, a number of other activities like demand and time deposits, foreign exchange transactions and in some countries like Israel even brokerage functions. It is widely recognized, certainly within the banking business community, that there is a positive association between the propensity of a customer to generate various businesses in the bank and the amount of credit that he obtains from the bank. Other things being equal, one would expect that such a relationship would imply that customers with more business would obtain more credit or better terms, or both. Empirical evidence on this point supports this implication. For example Harris [3, p. 238] finds that the value of the customer relationship is an important consideration in the allocation of credit to customers. In a related work, Harris [2] finds that the value of a customer as a depositor or a source of collateral business is an important consideration in lending decisions, particularly during tight money periods. In one way or another, credit as a means to influence the demand for banking services facing the bank is implicit in the theoretical literature on banking as well. Hodgman [4] and [5] considers the allocation of credit to customers as a means to increase the size and durability of the customer's deposit with the bank. The long-run value of a customer as a source of deposits and other business as a factor which influences the credit allocation decision of the bank appears also in Kane and Malkiel [8]. The purpose of this paper is to explore the implications of the existence of a positive dependency between the demand for banking services' and the amount of credit granted to a customer, for the nature of equilibrium in the credit market and the effects of monetary policy. This is done for an individual representative bank which operates under oligopolistic conditions since this seems to be the usual market structure of the banking industry in many countries.2 The basic model of a bank which sells credit and a composite banking service, the demand for which is positively related to the amount of credit the bank allocates, is presented in Section 1. It is shown that if the bank is constrained to charge all customers within a certain class the same rate of interest there will be some rationed customers even when the bank sets the rate of interest at its equilibrium level and even if there is no risk of default. Customers who have a higher marginal propensity to buy banking services when granted credit will not be rationed. Those with such low marginal propensities will be rationed. The equilibrium rate of interest will be lower than in a situation with no demand dependencies, the non-rationed customers will get more credit and the rationed customers",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a165-178..htm,10.2307/2297092

Schwartz']","1978, vol. 45, issue 1, 179-196",[],"The prospect of imminent exhaustion of some natural resources, especially those employed in energy generation, has prompted calls for conservation through reduction or even cessation of economic growth. A natural framework for analysing such proposals is a hybrid offspring of Ramsey's optimal growth model [8] and Hotelling's model of exhaustible resources [4]. Specifically, Anderson [1], Solow [10] and Stiglitz [11], among others, have recently studied optimal growth models modified to incorporate production requirements for an essential exhaustible resource. It has been shown that while resource irreplenishability limits growth in per capita consumption, this limitation may be offset by technical progress along with increasing capital accumulation and substitution. Reliance upon technical progress, in particular, to offset the constraining irreplenishability of a vital natural resource is based on its role as a major source of past economic growth. Along with the discovery of the past importance of technical progress has come awareness that it proceeds neither smoothly nor without effort. It is affected by the resources devoted to it. Unpredictability in technical progress results from our partial ignorance of the principles underlying natural and social phenomena. The randomness can be reduced at a cost, but it cannot be eliminated. These features of technical advance have typically not been incorporated in most of modern growth theory, wherein progress is regarded as proceeding steadily, costlessly and exogenously. In contrast, a few papers have considered more abrupt and significant changes in technology used. Smith [9] assumes that two alternate technologies are available from the outset, one requiring an exhaustible resource at low initial cost and the other employing an inexhaustible factor at high initial cost. He shows that maximum output will be achieved by using only the exhaustible resource technology at the beginning but gradually supplementing and then replacing it with the high-cost alternative. Dasgupta and Heal [2] considered the possibility that a new technology will eventually appear that does not employ limited natural resources. The technical advance could be costlessly achieved but the date of its availability was both random and exogenous. In a subsequent paper, Dasgupta, Heal and Majumdar [3] extended this model by making development of the new technology endogenous. Their model is very similar to and consistent with the one independently developed by us and described below. Our view is that technical advance is in large part neither costless nor exogenous [6]. The rate and direction of technical progress are influenced in the long run by the economic resources allotted to it, guided by the quest for profits and government policy. In this paper we follow the framework used by Dasgupta and Heal [2] while making technical advance endogenous. We omit steady technical progress that reduces unit factor requirements in favour of emphasizing a drastic technical change that relaxes the limitation imposed by",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a179-196..htm,10.2307/2297093

2299,Review of Economic Studies,A Note on Feldstein's Criticism of Mean-Variance Analysis: A Reply,['Martin Feldstein'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 1, 201",[],"Joram Mayshar's [3] note is a valuable contribution to the theory of mean-variance portfolio analysis. His two points are correctly and carefully stated. It is important, however, that these results should not be overinterpreted. Mayshar shows first that when the outcome of a portfolio mix can be represented in >u space, these preferences will be quasi-concave for a risk-averse investor. The lognormal distribution that I used [2] as a counter-example to Tobin's [4] conclusion is not quasi-concave but is excluded by Mayshar because such a distribution is not the result of a portfolio mix. Although Mayshar is correct to emphasize the importance of results that are restricted to the distributions generated by portfolio mix problems, this class of distributions is quite limited. Readers may recall that Tobin's original article stated preferences and subjective probabilities in terms of rates of return and therefore, like my comment on it, was not "" set as a problem of portfolio choice "" in Mayshar's sense. Mayshar's second point is that a I a representation of preferences always exists when one asset is safe and the other has a "" given "" distribution. There can obviously be no quarrel about this conclusion when the form of the "" given "" distribution is known. But more generally it remains true that if theform of the two-parameter distribution of the risky asset is unknown, a knowledge of these two parameters is not sufficient to rank the portfolio combinations that result from combining this risky asset with a safe asset. Developments in portfolio theory during the past decade have gone beyond the meanvariance framework to study the portfolio behaviour of risk-averse investors facing general probability distributions (e.g. Arrow [1]). The results of these investigations confirm that I-au analyses may be heuristically useful but should always be regarded as only illustrative of a possible special case.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a201..htm,10.2307/2297095
2300,Review of Economic Studies,Prices vs. Quantities: A Critical Note on the Use of Approximations,['James Malcomson'],"1978, vol. 45, issue 1, 203-207",[],"It seems to have become fashionable in economics to assume that some function has a particular form, such as quadratic, to derive some results on the basis of that form, and then to present those results as being approximate results for any case in which the original function can be approximated reasonably well by the particular form chosen. This is essentially the procedure used by Weitzman [2] in an interesting article in this Review discussing the question of whether it is better to use quantity control or control by price to regulate the output of some good. It is a procedure that has also been used by others. Weitzman justified it by asserting that it can be defended rigorously along the lines developed by Samuelson [1], although Samuelson is there concerned with a somewhat different problem. This procedure is not, however, a rigorous one and its use can, as I will show, give rise to misleading conclusions. At a heuristic level, it is not difficult to see where the problem may lie. The fact that an error in the representation of a function is small in relation to the values of that function does not necessarily imply that, after a number of manipulations, the resulting error is small in relation to the results that are derived. The point is a general one. The force of it can, I hope, be brought across by an example applied to the problem considered by Weitzman. Weitzman's argument is set out in terms of cost and benefit functions C(q, 0) and B(q, il), where q is the output produced and 0 and il are independent random variables reflecting the uncertainty involved in the functions. Weitzman assumes that "" the amount of uncertainty in marginal cost is ... sufficiently small to justify a second-order approximation of total cost and benefit functions ... around 4 "", where 4 is the quantity level chosen to maximize the excess of expected benefits over costs when quantity controls are used. Hence he treats the marginal cost and benefit functions Cl(q, 0) and Bl(q, '1) as represented by the linear functions",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a45_3ay_3a1978_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a203-207..htm,10.2307/2297096

2304,Review of Economic Studies,"The Noisy Monopolist: Imperfect Information, Price Dispersion and Price Discrimination",['Steven Salop'],"1977, vol. 44, issue 3, 393-406",[],"Although economists often assume that commodities form homogeneous categories with a single price, there are in fact heterogeneities within commodity groupings. Many markets for apparently identical commodities are characterized by dispersion in price and differences in durability and other quality measures. The information a buyer requires in order to obtain the lowest price or "" best buy must be produced at a cost. For example, various activities for producing this information are reading magazines such as Consumer Reports, consultations with friends and sales personnel, scanning newspaper advertisements and directly sampling store prices. Consumers' search techniques and the efficiency with which they gather information varies. This heterogeneity leads to differences in optimal information-gathering strategies. Those consumers who are more efficient information-gatherers and searchers obtain better buys on average. Although there are clearly private returns to information-gathering, dispersion appears socially wasteful. If there were no dispersion, consumers would not need to engage in this costly learning activity. It is only the failure of the market to price correctly that allows the private returns to search. This waste leads to the suspicion that a monopolistically controlled market will be characterized by a smaller degree of dispersion than a more competitive one. Stigler [19, p. 223] argues that "" From the manufacturer's viewpoint, uncertainty concerning his price is clearly disadvantageous, the cost of search is a cost of purchase, and consumption will be smaller the greater the dispersion of prices and the greater the optimum amount of search "". On the other hand, when consumers differ in their information-generating efficiencies and costs, dispersion serves as a device for splitting up the market to permit price discrimination. The basic idea is as follows. Suppose that demand conditions are such that the monopolist would like to price discriminate against the less efficient informationgatherers; that is, suppose the submarket consisting of inefficient consumers is more price inelastic. Given these potential gains from discrimination, the monopolist must also discover some method of identifying the inefficient, price inelastic consumers. Simply permitting dispersion is such a method since less-efficient information gatherers will search less and thus on average pay a higher price than will efficient searchers. The very presence of dispersion both splits the market and charges a higher purchase price to the submarket of inefficient searchers. Thus, dispersion acts as a costly device for sorting consumers into submarkets to permit price discrimination.

2306,Review of Economic Studies,"The Existence of Futures Markets, Noisy Rational Expectations and Informational Externalities",['Sanford Grossman'],"1977, vol. 44, issue 3, 431-449",[],"It is a fact that futures markets exist in some commodities and not others. Similarly, contingent commodity contracts of the type described by Debreu do not exist for all commodities in all states of the world. Any explanation of this phenomenon must be intimately connected with a theory of what functions these markets serve. The KeynesHicks theory of commodity futures markets is that they provide a mechanism by which risk averse speculators insure other risk averse traders who hold (positive or negative) stocks of a commodity subject to price fluctuation.' We propose a new explanation of the role of futures markets as a place where information is exchanged, and where people who collect and analyse information about future states of the world can earn a return on their investment in information gathering. In particular, it is shown how the private and social incentives for the operation of a futures market depend on how much information spot prices alone can convey from "" informed "" to "" uninformed"" traders. (Firms which have information about future states of the world are called ""informed "", while firms who do not are called "" uninformed "".) In equilibrium, without a futures market, informed firms will use their information about next period's price to make spot market purchases. The commodity purchase is stored in anticipation of a capital gain. Therefore, the trading activity of informed firms in the present spot market makes the spot price a function of their information. Uninformed traders can use the spot price as a statistic which reveals some of the informed traders' information. When the spot price reveals all of the informed traders' information, both types of traders have the same beliefs about next period's price. In this case there will be no incentive to trade based upon differences in beliefs about next period's price. In general the spot price will not reveal all of the informed traders' information because there are many other factors ("" noise "") which determine the price along with the informed traders' information. This implies that in equilibrium with only a spot market, informed and uninformed traders will have different beliefs about next period's price. The difference in beliefs creates an incentive for futures trading in addition to the usual hedging incentive. When a futures market is introduced uninformed firms will have the futures price as well as the spot price transmitting the informed firms' information to them. This is the informational role of futures markets. The model has the following testable implications. The degree of predictability of a future spot price from only a current spot price determines the private incentives for futures trading in a commodity which has no futures market. For commodities with futures markets the volume of futures trading is directly related to how poorly current and futures prices predict the future spot price, relative to how well various exogenous variables predict the future spot price. "" How well "" refers to mean square prediction error conditional on available information, not biasedness of the predictions.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a44_3ay_3a1977_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a431-449..htm,10.2307/2296900

2313,Review of Economic Studies,Guarantees and Risk-Sharing,['Geoffrey Heal'],"1977, vol. 44, issue 3, 549-560",[],"The fact that a consumer is frequently uncertain about the quality of a product that he purchases, and is therefore also unsure of the extent to which it will render him the services he might expect of it, is one that is gaining increasing recognition. In an earlier paper [5] I examined in a simple framework the effects of changes in the uncertainty about a product's quality on the consumer's demand, and also touched briefly on the effect of a guarantee. In this paper I want to examine in more detail some of the economic issues posed by the existence of guarantees. There are several useful distinctions that can be drawn as a preliminary to more detailed study. One is a distinction between situations where buyers and sellers have equal access to information, and a situation where sellers have superior access. The first situation is exemplified by a market where trade is in a product whose quality is genuinely random, with the distribution known to both buyers and sellers. Thus if a certain fraction p of the cars from a given factory are generally known to be faulty, then a transaction in which a retailer sells a car to a buyer comes into this category: each knows that the chance of the car being faulty is p, but, because the car is unused, neither knows whether it is actually faulty. Contrast this with a situation where the first owner of the car is reselling it: now there is an important asymmetry, in that the seller is much better informed about the quality of the product than the buyer. This is the case with which Akerlof's very interesting analysis [1] is largely concerned, and which I have also discussed in [4]. My main concern here, however, is with a situation of equal information. Thinking casually about such a situation, it is clear that one can distinguish between the incentive effects and the risk-sharing effects of a guarantee. Incentive effects arise because the existence of a guarantee provides the producer with an incentive to improve the quality of his product, at least to the extent of reducing the chances of its falling below the guaranteed level. If the compensation in the event of failure is less than complete, then the consumer also has an incentive to maintain the product. For example, a used car guarantee, under which the buyer and seller will each pay half of any repair bills, provides both parties with incentives to minimize these bills. Of course, if the guarantee is valid for only a limited period of time, then there is the further effect of providing the buyer with an incentive to ensure that if there is to be a failure, it occurs early in the product's life. This may act in opposition to the other effect, and reduce his eagerness to maintain the product. In addition to creating the incentive effects mentioned, a guarantee also acts as a way of sharing the risk associated with uncertainty about the quality of a product: to be efficient in this sense, it will apportion this risk in accordance with the risk-aversion of the participants. My main concern here is with the risk-sharing aspects of guarantees. This is partly because these seem to be the most tractable aspects of the problem, but also stems from a belief that these are the most important aspects. Casual empiricism suggests that except in rather unique cases, a product is usually designed and produced before any attention is given to the choice of guarantee terms: these are then chosen as part of a marketing package. In such situations, the reliability of the product will clearly be independent of the",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a44_3ay_3a1977_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a549-560..htm,10.2307/2296907

2315,Review of Economic Studies,On the Choice of Numeraire and Certainty Price in General Equilibrium Models of Price Uncertainty,"['John S. Flemming', 'Stephen J Turnovsky', 'Murray Kemp']","1977, vol. 44, issue 3, 573-583",[],"Over the past few years a number of papers have been written analysing the effects of price uncertainty on a small trading country.' The conventional approach adopted in these studies is first to pick a numeraire commodity, thereby defining a relative price (terms of trade) which the small country takes as exogenously given. The objective is then to compare various decisions and quantities when this relative price is random with what they would be under certainty. To make this comparison one must introduce a "" certainty price "" and without exception this has quite naturally and unquestioningly been the arithmetic mean of this relative price. Typical of such studies is a recent article in this Review by one of the present authors, Turnovsky [12]. He considers the impact of price uncertainty on a small country's allocation of a single input to the production of two goods using a Ricardian technology.2 It turns out that by using the arithmetic mean of a relative price as the certainty price, some of his propositions are weakened in so far as they are dependent upon the choice of numeraire good. This is clearly an unsatisfactory situation since this choice is presumably an arbitrary one. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First we wish to use one of his propositions (proposition 7) to illustrate how the use of the arithmetic mean makes the result dependent upon the choice of numeraire. We also show (Section 3) how this dependence can be avoided if some other measure of central tendency such as the geometric mean is used as the certainty price, in which case the proposition holds unambiguously. The second objective is a somewhat more general one. As already indicated, the procedure followed by Turnovsky is in fact the standard one in this literature. Much of it, particularly those papers dealing with the neoclassical technology, makes extensive use of Jensen's inequality, which enables the effects of uncertainty to be determined from the convexity-concavity properties of relevant functions.3 It turns out that in many cases the choice of numeraire influences these properties, leading to the same kind of difficulty as",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a44_3ay_3a1977_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a573-583..htm,10.2307/2296909

2318,Review of Economic Studies,Equity and the Informational Basis of Collective Choice,"[""Claude d'Aspremont"", 'Louis Gevers']","1977, vol. 44, issue 2, 199-209",[],"We consider the problem of a planner or ethical observer who wants to derive a collective preference ordering over a set of feasible alternatives from the knowledge of individual utility functions. By assumption, he is concerned with social welfare judgements, not with committee decisions. As a tool of analysis, we use the concept of social welfare functional (SWFL), which was developed by Sen [9] on foundations originally laid down by Arrow [1]. Rather than to compare SWFL’s directly, we treat them somewhat like composite goods and we compare sets of axioms which characterize them. We select five such sets, which differ mainly with respect to the planner’s informational basis. This term refers to an “invariance” axiom which defines in each case the measurability and comparability properties of individual utility functions. Taking up a suggestion of Sen’s [10], we focus our attention on the implications of each informational basis for the equity content of collective choice. Our study does not treat all possible invariance axioms; it does not even exhaust all the most relevant ones. However, we think that it brings about some logical clarification. Among other things, we characterize utilitarianism and the leximin (or lexical maximin) principle by means of two sets of axioms which differ only in one respect, viz. the invariance axiom. The paper is divided into three sections. In Section 1 we describe our problem formally, we discuss our invariance axioms, and we show that some of them are equivalent, in the light of the Review of Economic Studies, 44(2), 199-209, 1977.

2319,Review of Economic Studies,A Characterization of Societies with Consistent Majority Decision,['Steven Slutsky'],"1977, vol. 44, issue 2, 211-225",[],"Extensive work in the social choice literature has centred around conditions under which majority voting makes consistent (transitive, quasi-transitive, or acyclic) decisions. This paper attempts a general characterization of societies with consistent majority decision, something previously not achieved in the literature. The first step involves the construction of new societies which are equivalent in majority voting to a given society but which are more amenable to analysis. Specifically, the new societies are the transitive strict preference (TSP) equivalent, one in which the preferences of every individual are transitive with no indifference, and the equivalent irreducible society, one that includes no group of individuals which under majority voting is indifferent among all the alternatives. Consistent majority decision is then shown to result for a society if the irreducible society equivalent to it either directly or through its TSP equivalent satisfies one of the classes of restrictionexclusion and dominance-found in the literature. In addition, results are presented that lead to a reinterpretation of the exclusion conditions as a type of dominance. The remainder of this introductory section surveys the conditions for consistency found in the literature and states the general goals to be accomplished by the characterization of this paper. Section 1 presents the framework of the analysis and gives an informal statement and interpretation of the results. Section 2 provides formal statements and proofs.' Specifically, two types of restrictions that ensure consistency have been discovered. One type, first studied by Black [2] and Arrow [1] with further work by Fishburn [4], Inada [5], [6], Pattanaik [10], [11], Sen, [13], [14], [15], [16], Sen and Pattanaik [17] and Ward [21] among others, is the "" exclusion "" conditions. Each exclusion condition gives a set of preferences none of which may be held by any individual in a society. These conditions are not necessary, and many consistent societies which violate them can be found. The known set of conditions of this type, however, has been shown to be complete with no others remaining to be discovered. Other restrictions that extend in some way the exclusion conditions but which still ensure consistency have not been presented in the literature. The difficulty comes in part from the fact that even slight violations of the exclusion conditions can lead to voting cycles. The other type of condition, given by Nicholson [9], is more than a pure exclusion restriction. This condition does rule out individuals holding certain preference patterns but it then places, in addition, other restrictions upon the distribution of individuals having the non-excluded preferences. These further restrictions are both necessary and sufficient for transitivity of majority decision given the initial exclusion. More generally, in seeking domain restrictions to achieve consistent majority decision, two central questions are considered. The first asks if any interesting restrictions exist. To economists, this means: are any restrictions likely to be satisfied in situations in which majority voting is used to handle either allocation decisions in the public sector or such distributional questions as the structure of the tax system? The answer has been predominantly negative. Most of the work cited earlier has been in the context of unstructured sets of alternatives and, hence, the usual economic assumptions of convexity for the feasible set",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a44_3ay_3a1977_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a211-225..htm,10.2307/2297062
2320,Review of Economic Studies,Expected Plurality Voting Equilibrium and Social Choice Functions,"['Arthur T. Denzau', 'Amoz Kats']","1977, vol. 44, issue 2, 227-233",[],"One of the routes for bypassing Arrow's Impossibility result [1] on social choice functions is that taken by Hinich and Ordeshook [8] and Hinich, Ledyard and Ordeshook [7].1 They relax the assumption of a deterministic vote by an individual based on his own preferences, and, rather, assume that given a set of alternatives there is a probability distribution for each individual indicating the probability that he will vote for each alternative or that he will not vote at all. Also a new probabilistic equilibrium concept is used in which expected plurality replaces plurality in the deterministic models.2 The mathematical tool used by Hinich, Ledyard and Ordeshook is game theory. In this paper we use this probabilistic approach for several reasons. For one we consider it a good substitute to the single-peakedness approach. In particular, the assumption about the probability of voting functions being concave in one argument (a precise definition comes later) seems to us to be less severe than single-peakedness. This is so since a probability function can be viewed as a conditional utility function of a candidate (an elaboration on this will come later). In our opinion, this is so even in the one-dimensional case. And since it allows one to get some results in the multi-dimensional case as well, when singlepeakedness is not sufficient, it appears overall to be a better approach. We expand the work of Hinich, Ledyard and Ordeshook in several ways. Our assumptions (see Section 2) are much weaker than theirs. For example, we do not require differentiable utility functions or symmetric probability functions (an assumption which they did not make explicitly, but which is embedded implicitly intheir work). By weakening the assumptions we give up the uniqueness of equilibrium and, in particular, we show that the sets of equilibrium points for each candidate may differ. This result, which differs from the "" median-position "" result stated first by Black [3], may explain, at least in part, why candidates choose somewhat different positions. The existence of different equilibrium points for different candidates no longer gives rise to just one social choice function, but to several. Finally, we use a method of proof (see Section 3) much simpler and much less technical than that used by HLO. This method is based on a recently stated fixed-point theorem [6]. 2.

2321,Review of Economic Studies,A Game of Fair Division,['Vincent Crawford'],"1977, vol. 44, issue 2, 235-247",[],"The "" divide-and-choose "" method has played an important role in the literature on fair division.' This technique for allocating bundles of goods seems impartial, requires little cooperation from agents, and is nearly free of administrative costs. It is therefore somewhat puzzling that it has found so few applications in the real world, where sometimes even prolonged and costly negotiations produce only imperfect agreements. Either the method has drawbacks not yet well understood, or it is underutilized. This paper examines the game that arises when two agents agree to use the divide-and-choose method. The analysis leads to a resolution of the puzzle mentioned above and identifies a class of situations where replacing conventional arbitration procedures with the divide-and-choose method can be strongly recommended. In the sequel, an agent who would prefer another agent's bundle of goods to his own will be said to envy the other agent. An allocation at which no agent envies another will be called a fair allocation.2 A well-known property of the two-person version of the divideand-choose game3 is that each player can insure that he does not envy the other. The divider (D) can accomplish this by dividing so that lie is indifferent to his opponent's choice; the chooser (C) need only choose his most preferred bundle after D divides. It is interesting that the players can insure that the outcome of the game is fair, but more information about the allocations actually generated by the game is needed to judge its usefulness as a fair division device. Conceivably, with players motivated by self-interest, the game could generate an unfair allocation in spite of the above result. To learn more about the divide-and-choose method, I assume that players seek to obtain the most desirable bundle possible. They are also assumed to behave noncooperatively, since negotiating a mutually acceptable settlement would be relatively easy if they were willing to cooperate, and the method would then be superfluous. In Section 2 of this paper D's problem is formulated and his optimal non-cooperative strategy is characterized. As is suggested by Kolm [6, p. 61], Luce and Raiffa [8, p. 365] and Singer [12], the common belief that D should divide the bundle so that D is indifferent about C's choice is false. If D knows C's preferences with certainty, under very general conditionsroughly, that players' behaviour can be described by the maximization of continuous and strongly monotonic utility functions and that goods are homogeneous and perfectly divisible-his optimal strategy involves dividing the bundle so that it is C, rather than D, who is indifferent about his choice. Once D's optimal strategy has been characterized, several interesting conclusions follow. As Kolm [6, p. 31] points out, Luce and Raiffa's belief [8, pp. 364-365] that the",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a44_3ay_3a1977_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a235-247..htm,10.2307/2297064

For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed throughout that the firm knows the future perfectly' and that the inflation rate is certain, constant and everlasting from the origin of time through infinity.

Kearl']","1977, vol. 44, issue 2, 305-320",[],"As a purely theoretical matter, aggregate production functions exist only under conditions too stringent to be believed satisfied by the diverse technological relationships of actual economies. There is a summary discussion and bibliography in Fisher [2]. Yet aggregate production functions estimated from real data do appear to give good results, at least sometimes, and to do so in an apparently non-trivial way. Not only do such estimated relationships give good fits to input and output data, but also the calculated marginal products appear to be related to observed factor payments. Alternatively, production functions with parameters estimated from factor payments turn out to fit input and output data pretty well sometimes. It is not a simple matter to decide why this should be so as a matter of theory. Indeed, the problem is sufficiently complicated that perhaps the most promising mode of attack on it is through the construction and analysis of simulation experiments. By constructing simplified economies in which the conditions for aggregation are known not to be satisfied, we can hope to find out inductively the circumstances under which aggregate production functions appear to give good results in the double sense just discussed. Moreover, such experiments can cast light on other aspects of the estimation of aggregate production functions from underlying non-aggregatable data. The related papers of Houthakker [4], Levhari [6] and Sato [8] do not bear directly on the problems here addressed. Those papers show what aggregate production functions can be expected when the distribution of capital over firms with related technologies is fixed (or changes in very restricted ways). Such fixity of distribution, however, can hardly be expected in the real world and is certainly not true in the world of simulation experiments reported below and in Fisher [3]. Here the issue is that of why aggregate production functions should appear to exist at all, rather than that of what form they will take given that a constant distribution of capital over firms ensures their existence. See Fisher [2, pp. 571-574]. The books by Johansen [5] and Sato [9] give excellent discussions of aggregation from several points of view. This programme of research was begun in Fisher [3]; individual firms (with a single homogeneous output and single homogeneous labour but different capital types) were given different Cobb-Douglas production functions, underlying capital and labour data were generated in various ways, and labour was assigned to firms to maximize output. An aggregate Cobb-Douglas production function was then estimated and its wage predictions examined. A number of subsidiary results were found in these experiments, and we shall comment",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a44_3ay_3a1977_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a305-320..htm,10.2307/2297068

2327,Review of Economic Studies,Turnpike Properties for the Optimal Use of a Natural Resource,"['A. Haurie', 'N. M. Hung']","1977, vol. 44, issue 2, 329-336",[],"This paper is an attempt to deal rigorously with some fundamental mathematical problems arising from the consideration of natural resources in the neoclassical framework of optimal economic growth. The theory of optimal economic growth initiated by Ramsey [20] and developed by many others has benefited considerably from an optimal control formulation (see for example [1] and [22]). Incidentally it posed two interesting problems which seem to be typical of these economic models. The first one concerns the precise formulation of the Turnpike Property (see Cass [5]), the second one is the definition and the characterization of the optimality when the time interval considered is infinite and the formulation of existence conditions for such an optimal solution (see Koopmans [14]). It appeared that the two problems are linked together through the important role played in both problems by an optimal steady state suitably defined (see for example Gale [9] and McKenzie [17] for discrete time growth models and Haurie [11] for continuous time control systems). In the case of optimal exploitation of a natural resource, the Turnpike Property is well illustrated by the very simple model of optimal fish-harvesting studied by Cliff and Vincent [6] (this model is very close to the one proposed by Plourde [19]). Those authors showed that, for their particular model, any optimal trajectory on a sufficiently large interval would contain a singular arc where the fish population is maintained at its level of maximal yield, this singular arc being independent of the initial and terminal conditions. This result is similar to the turnpike property first presented in DOSSO [8] for efficient programmes of capital accumulation and then extended to the neoclassical optimal growth framework. However no formal proof has been given yet for an extension of the turnpike property to the case of an optimal growth model where both capital and natural resources enter into the production process. A first difference between capital and resource assets is that the former enter as stock inputs in the production process while the latter are often flow inputs. Another difference is that capital depreciates over time and is reproducible through investment while a natural resource is depleted by its use in the economic process and, when replenishable, reproduces itself according to a natural law. In Section 3 this extended turnpike property is proven for a continuous time model and expressed as a bound for the measure of the time spent away from the Von Neumann Set of the economy, a set which always contains the optimal steady state. This is essentially an adaptation of the classical result obtained by McKenzie in a discrete time setting without natural resources. When the Von Neumann set reduces to a",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a44_3ay_3a1977_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a329-336..htm,10.2307/2297070

Thus it is not surprising that when considering Rawls' contribution to justice theory the economists' interest has focused upon Rawls' alternative principles for intertemporal distribution, specifically for intergenerational distribution. What is surprising is how Rawls deals with intergenerational distribution, having a different principle of justice to allocate within generations than the process used to allocate between generations, a view he has since confirmed: "" I should add that the criterion (maximin) is unsuitable for determining the just rate of saving, it is intended only to hold within generations "" [8].

Russell', 'Tae Kun Seo']","1977, vol. 44, issue 2, 363-368",[],"By now it has been firmly established that, under a variety of circumstances, risk averters should follow a policy of diversifying their investments. Several different theorems dealing with the conditions for diversification have recently appeared in the literature; for example [2], [3], [6]. The most general of these results says that if n assets are independently distributed, have equal means, and positive finite variances, the optimal portfolio for each risk averter includes some positive amount of each asset. The attractiveness of this theorem derives from the fact that optimality follows despite only weak conditions imposed on the distributions. The disadvantage is that it cannot identify any specific diversified portfolio which all risk averters would prefer to specialized ones. For unanimous ranking of portfolios stronger conditions are required, such as those used in the diversification theorems given in [2], [3]. For example, when two assets are identically distributed, any mixture of the two assets is preferred to a specialized portfolio by every risk averter. And in the case where the joint distribution of the individual assets is symmetric, the portfolio with an equal amount of each asset is the optimal portfolio for every risk averter. In this paper we consider the case where risk averters unanimously judge a particular asset to be superior to all other assets. Somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that risk averters will unanimously prefer certain diversified portfolios to specializing in the superior asset. This result holds if and only if the independently distributed prospects have equal means and the same range.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a44_3ay_3a1977_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a363-368..htm,10.2307/2297073

2333,Review of Economic Studies,A Note on Producer Taxation and Public Production,['Efraim Sadka'],"1977, vol. 44, issue 2, 385-387",[],"An interesting question in public economics is the desirability of production efficiency in an economy where there are no restrictions on the government with respect to commodity and profit taxation. Diamond and Mirrless [1] considered economies with constant returns-toscale technologies and concluded, among other things, that overall production efficiency is desirable under fairly general conditions. A subsequent paper by Mirrlees [3] dealt with economies possessing both constant and decreasing returns-to-scale technologies. In that paper Mirrlees derived conditions under which aggregate production efficiency is desirable. When these conditions are not met, then "" production efficiency is desirable (only) for a class of producers, namely those who are to produce at all . . . "" ([3, p. 107]). We shall show in this note that the latter conclusion is erroneous and offer another class of producers for which production efficiency is desirable. We shall find first a particular class of producers for which production efficiency is desirable. For this purpose let us recall Mirrlees' notation. Let Yi (with elements y,), j = 1, ..., m, be the production set of the jth firm and let G (with elements z) be the public production set. All of these sets are assumed to be closed and convex and to contain the origin. Suppose first that each firm has unique (up to a scalar multiplication) supply prices pj(yj) which vary continuously with net outputs yj. Define rj(yj) to be the profit of producer j, namely: rj(yj) _ yj.pj(yj). This profit function is clearly continuous. The rate of profit tax (possibly negative) which is imposed on firm j is denoted by 1-aj < 1. Consumers (with diverse tastes) face consumer prices q. Aggregate net demand is denoted by x{q; a1rl(yl), ..., amrm(ym)}, since it depends on the consumer prices and the net profit of each firm; x is assumed to be continuous in q. Similarly, the indirect social welfare function is denoted by V{q; a1rl(yl), ..., amrm(ym)}. It is assumed that V does not attain a local unconstrained maximum with respect to q. This assumption trivially holds if there is a commodity that no consumer buys (respectively, sells) and some sell (respectively, buy). The problem at hand is to choose q, z E G, yj E Yj and aj .

2334,Review of Economic Studies,A Theory of Piecemeal Policy Recommendations,['Tatsuo Hatta'],"1977, vol. 44, issue 1, 1-21",[],"The theory of the second best, first formally presented by Lipsey and Lancaster [16], maintains that the abolition of an arbitrarily chosen distortion in an economy with multiple distortions may reduce the welfare of the economy. The main objective of the present paper is to formulate some piecemeal policy recommendations which would definitely result in a move towards efficiency. In particular, we will prove the following: (a) a policy which reduces all price distortions uniformly will improve the welfare of the economy, if it is stable in the Marshallian sense. (b) a policy which brings the highest distortion to the level of the next highest will improve the welfare of the economy, if the good with the highest distortion is substitutable for all the other goods and if the economy is stable in the Marshallian sense. Our results integrate the characterization of the second best solution by Green [9], the analysis of the uniform reduction of tariff and excise tax by Foster and Sonnenschein [8] and Bruno [4], and the demonstration by Kemp [15] that the welfare effect of the tariff reduction in the two commodity world is related to the stability of the economy. In the present paper, an extensive use of the compensated demand function enables us to reveal the underlying relationship among these seemingly unrelated works.' In Section 2, we will define the compensated demand function, and will present its properties used in this paper. The model will be presented in Section 3. In Section 4 we will establish that in an economy with constant-cost technology a uniform reduction in excise tax rates improves welfare provided that the aggregate of income terms weighted by marginal costs (AIM) is positive. We will also show that a reduction of the highest tax rate to the level of the next highest rate improves the welfare if the AIM is positive and if the good with the highest tax rate is substitutable for all other goods. In Section 5 the main theorems will be proved by establishing that the positivity of AIM in the propositions of Section 4 can be replaced by another condition if the economy is stable under the Marshallian adjustment mechanism (which is defined in the text).

2337,Review of Economic Studies,A Variable-Parameter Model of Exporting Behaviour,['R. A. Batchelor'],"1977, vol. 44, issue 1, 43-57",[],"This paper has two purposes. The first is to introduce an econometric model of export pricing and sales behaviour, the parameters of which vary with some indicator of excess productive capacity. For the individual firm this is achieved simply by proposing that it follows a demand-constrained regime when levels of working are low, and a supplyconstrained regime when full capacity is approached. Application of this sort of model to the whole economy would lead to implausible discontinuities; as overall capacity utilization rose a switching point would be reached where factors influencing demand-world trade, competitor prices-became suddenly unimportant and those influencing supply-investment, profitability-became suddenly all-important. The second purpose of this paper is to offer a resolution of this conceptual inelegance by postulating that at any one time firms experience a variety of capacity utilization conditions distributed around means which are generally high at peaks of the domestic business cycle and low in troughs. The resulting aggregate equations exhibit no unwonted discontinuities. The potential area of application of this device is large, as all multi-regime models involve some abrupt changes in the behaviour patterns of the agents they describe. It is, however, circumscribed by the technical problems of combining the aggregation procedure with constraints on the agents' behaviour which are essentially stochastic, and by the need to fabricate data on the way the switching variable (capacity utilization) is distributed across individual agents (firms). We shall look at two versions of the export model, the first resting on the assumption that the constraints on firm behaviour share a common stochastic term, thus effectively reducing these technical problems to those of pure aggregation, the second on the more general premise that such random elements are independent. The first suffices to illustrate the important points that weighting or sample-splitting schemes are inappropriate to its estimation, and that there is a real danger of incorrectly rejecting the hypothesis that two regimes are at work if firms differ in their experience of the switching variable. The second model is developed partly to reveal a further source of bias in this direction, but mainly to catalogue the practical problems of obtaining a manageable estimating equation for a model in which independent stochastic constraints coexist with an aggregation problem. This is in fact achieved only by confining all random variables to a non-normal class of distribution functions which is tailored to produce relatively simple expressions for total exports while making full use of the meagre data available on intraindustry variations in capacity utilization. In the first section below, the basic model of the exporting firm is formalized and set in the context of current research on models with varying parameters. In the second section, aggregate equations for the economy's exports are derived and the problems of estimation and measurement posed by them are discussed. Finally, estimated equations for the volume and price of UK exports of manufactured goods are presented with special emphasis on the distinct effects of cyclical variations in the degree of capacity utilization on export demand and supply.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a44_3ay_3a1977_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a43-57..htm,10.2307/2296972

 A mathematical model is established whereby optimal accumulation paths of population and the economy can be figured when the basic feature of population dynamics, age dependence, is taken into account. This model series links 2 previously separate disciplines and literatures - i.e., formal policy dealing with the dynamics of age and time. An integral-equation control theory is utilized. Recognition of age structure in analyzing fertility trends is important at both macro- and microeconomic levels. The present model was constructed by embedding an age-disaggregated population in a simple economic growth model where the fertility level and rate of savings can both be influenced by government policy. Such policy should balance the lifetime value of births and capital against the social costs necessary to create them. One the problem has been defined and a dynamic theory developed, optimum static theories can be establihsed where the variables are held constant over time.

The extent of the original reserve limits the total quantity of the resource that can be extracted over time. The model is conducted with all parties cognizant of the quantities they control, the related costs of extraction, future price trends, and future government actions. A purely competitive market is found to support optimal allocations, while percentage depletion allowances are found to encourage over-extraction. The direction of bias as a result of price controls requires further data. Monopolies can lead to current under-use or over-use, which will determine future availability. Over-use can also result from insecure imported sources unless appropriate tariffs are imposed. A market imperfection function concept is used to derive these results. 16 references.

2343,Review of Economic Studies,Dual Stability in a Cambridge-type Model,['Masahiko Aoki'],"1977, vol. 44, issue 1, 143-151",[],"In this paper we are concerned with the dynamic properties of a multi-firm model of the Cambridge-type. The essential feature of the model is the assumption that, in making decisions concerning investments and prices, firms lack an exact knowledge of future demands and equilibrium prices. The dual stability-instability property of Leontief models (e.g. [2], [6, pp. 81-84]) or saddle-point property of neoclassical models (e.g. [1], [3]) is essentially due to the unrealistic assumption of perfect foresight. The first object of this paper is to show that, relaxing this assumption, a dual stability property for both quantities and prices holds. As firms must create output capacity for unknown future demand, excess capacity may result when out of equilibrium. But it will be shown that a certain type of investment behaviour where the firms learn from past experience would tend to adjust the structure of productive capacity to steady-state requirements. As for the price system, full cost pricing is assumed. In the short period, the firms produce as much as they can sell at fixed prices and they then revise these prices when a change in costs occurs. Furthermore, it will be assumed that the money wage rate increases at certain periods of time and that the firms pass it on in the form of higher prices. The second object of this paper is to examine under a simple Cambridge saving condition how real phenomena such as the rate of equilibrium growth, the stability of the input-output system, and the level of real wages are affected by the bargaining power of workers as well as by the monopoly power of firms.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a44_3ay_3a1977_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a143-151..htm,10.2307/2296978
2344,Review of Economic Studies,Rate of Growth Effects on Aggregate Savings: Further Analysis,['Thomas Russell'],"1977, vol. 44, issue 1, 153-168",[],"The basic question investigated in this paper is whether or not individual saving for retirement and (possibly) bequests can generate aggregate rates of accumulation of capital close to those which are observed. A quite understandable reaction to this question is that it was disposed of many years ago by Modigliani and Brumberg [1], [2], when they showed with a very simple model of the consumers' lifetime income process that rates of savings akin to those of the US could be generated using US demographic data. It is important to note, however, that the model which Modigliani and Brumberg use does not assume that the individual has perfect foreknowledge of his future income stream. This forces the individual annually to replan consumption, using each year whatever new information is available on the likely future income path. This "" periodic replanning"" assumption has a number of consequences.' From our point of view the most important of these is that it makes aggregate consumption sensitive to the procedure used to forecast future income. Modigliani and Brumberg assume that the individual forecasts future income in the following myopic fashion. At each point of time, wage income till retirement will be the current wages earned at that time. After retirement, of course, wage income will be zero. When productivity growth is taking place, this amounts to the assumption that the individual never learns that income is growing. As M. J. Farrell [3] has pointed out, this is a sufficiently unusual assumption to warrant testing the sensitivity of the model's results to it. Farrell [3], for example, keeps all the other Modigliani-Brumberg assumptions but assumes that the individual correctly foresees the growth of future income, and in this case shows that the model not only yields markedly different predictions of the savings/income ratio but, for a growth rate of 4 per cent, actually yields the prediction that the savings/income ratio will be negative. This possibility had been noted earlier by Modigliani [4]. However, in defence of the myopia assumption, Modigliani argued that even if individuals did correctly foresee a rising income, institutional capital market constraints would prevent them from borrowing against this rising income. Thus the consumption plan chosen would not differ very much from the myopia path. Institutional constraints on capital markets are one thing, however, and assumptions about expectations formation are another. To quote Farrell [3, p. 879]: "" Ideally some sort of asset constraint should be included in the model, and might give Modigliani the approximation he seeks; but it is of little help to us in choosing between two expectational hypotheses."" In this paper we examine the Lifetime Income model under a number of different assumptions both with regard to expectations and with regard to capital market imperfections. In particular we compare aggregate consumption and savings under three different planning regimes, utility maximisation with perfect foresight and perfect capital markets (Model 1), utility maximisation with perfect foresight but borrowing constraints (Model 2) and the original Modigliani-Brumberg case of equal planned consumption in each period but with imperfect foresight of future income (Model 3).",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a44_3ay_3a1977_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a153-168..htm,10.2307/2296979

Along with growing public concern in environmental and urban problems, the keen attention of economists has been paid to studies of production activities which employ three (or more) factors, say, capital, labour and natural resources such as land or energy. Here again, as well as in the aggregate two-factor model of production, various formulae of elasticities of factor substitution (ES) are proved to be useful for the analysis of the internal structure of production in the works of Hicks [5], Binswanger [3], Berndt and Wood [2] and others. However, a question of symmetry of ES seems to have been totally overlooked in the literature. For example, we ask: is the ES of capital for resources always identical with the ES of resources for capital in the presence of labour as a third factor? As long as we follow Joan Robinson's original definition of ES, there is no ready-made answer to this type of question.

Orosel'],"1977, vol. 44, issue 1, 195-196",[],"In two very interesting articles Grandmont and Younes [2], [3] introduced a concept of Clower [1] into the framework of general equilibrium theory. In [3] they showed that monetary equilibrium is Pareto inefficient in their model and that this inefficiency can be overcome if, by lump-sum taxation, a deflation is generated, the rate of which equals the (common) rate of time preference of the economic agents. Further, they analysed the alternative policy, proposed by Johnson [4] and others in order to overcome the Pareto inefficiency of monetary equilibrium, the payment of interest on money at a properly chosen rate. Their conclusion is that "" the payment of a nominal rate of interest on money holdings cannot by itself affect the ' real ' magnitudes describing the steady state market equilibria"" [3, p. 151]. The reason for this "" long run neutrality of interest payments on money"" [3, p. 161] is that the economic agents "" are only interested in ' real ' interest payments on money balances. As the payment of a nominal rate r on money holdings induces (in the long run) an equal increase of the rate of inflation, this leaves unchanged the ' real' long long run rate of interest on money holdings. Therefore the payment of a nominal rate of interest on money balances cannot by itself influence steady state consumption and real balances. Only taxation policy by means of lump sum taxes can do so by creating a gap between the nominal interest rate and the rate of inflation"" [3, p. 162]. This comment intends to show that this result is not as general as the quotations given might suggest. Rather, the result stems from a special taxation policy assumed by the authors which implies a budget deficit-and therefore inflation-relative to the case without interest payments on money. In an appropriate treatment of the problem the interest payments on money should in no period alter the budget surplus, because the effects of interest payments should be isolated from budgetary effects; further, only such a policy is compatible with Johnson's proposals (see e.g. [5, pp. 138-139]). In the model of Grandmont and Younes, on the other hand, what is fixed is not the budget balance but the ratio of the total value of taxes to the money stock of the following period. Denote by M(t) the stock of money in period t (time being measured in discrete intervals) and let us first look at the case with no interest payments on money but with (taxation caused) deflation. At the beginning of period t taxes to be paid in money are collected in such a way that the sum equals (a 1)M(t1) with 0 < ax < 1, its distribution among the individual agents being fixed independently of economic activities. The government, then, costlessly destroys all the money it has received as taxes. Hence the time sequence of the money stock is given by M(t) = a""t' M (M being the initial value of the money stock), which in the model of Grandmont and Younes implies a real rate of return",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a44_3ay_3a1977_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a195-196..htm,10.2307/2296988

On the one hand, these predictions are important for discussions of the ultimate size of money transfers that will result from the institution of various tax and subsidy proposals.' On the other hand, these predictions are important for discussions of the economic efficiency of income and commodity taxes and subsidies, regardless of whether one measures the "" deadweight loss "" of a tax or subsidy or whether one directly attempts to determine the "" optimum "" tax or subsidy.2 In each of these cases empirical estimates of the effects of wage and commodity taxes on the incomecompensated demands for all commodities and on the supply of labour are necessary. At the same time, the extensive empirical work on the estimation of systems of commodity demand functions has continued independently of the rebirth of interest in the empirical estimation of labour supply functions.3 This is especially surprising since the theoretical inspiration for both bodies of empirical work is the classical theory of consumer choice and since the important work by both Becker [7] and Mincer [32] has emphasized that the wage rate plays a role not only as income but as a price in the allocation of non-market time and the demand for commodities. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to summarize the implications of the classical theory of choice as applied to the consumer-worker for the relationships among commodity demand and labour supply functions, and then to explore the usefulness of these implications in the estimation of a complete set of seven aggregate commodity demand functions and an aggregate labour supply (hours of work) function. In the first section of the paper we summarize the general implications of the integrated economic theory of the demand for commodities and the allocation of time. We also set out the conditions under which the labour supply decision and the allocation of income to expenditure on commodities may be separated, as is implicitly assumed in most empirical work on consumer demand.4 The second section of the paper is a discussion of the data used for the empirical work in the third section. The latter includes the estimation of commodity demand and labour supply functions based on explicit direct and indirect utility functions and some approximate tests of the usefulness of the general empirical implications of the theoretical framework, including a test for whether non-market time may be considered separable in utility from commodities. In view of the fact that our results can hardly be considered the last word on the subject we conclude with observations on their limitations and the further research that would be desirable.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a43_3ay_3a1976_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a389-411..htm,10.2307/2297216
2358,Review of Economic Studies,"Soviet Pricing, Profits and Technological Choice",['Michael Manove'],"1976, vol. 43, issue 3, 413-421",[],"It is an article of faith in Western economic thought that the only useful prices are scarcity prices, that is, marginal-cost prices which equate supply and demand. This idea receives its most vigorous support when the pricing of inputs is to be used as a means of bringing about productive efficiency. Even some socialists accepted this view. In his essay, "" On the Economic Theory of Socialism "", Oskar Lange [2, p. 94] wrote that "" the rule to produce at the minimum average cost has no significance . . . unless prices represent the relative scarcity of the factors of production "". Official Soviet policy requires that prices of producers' goods be set so as to ensure a ""profit for each normally functioning enterprise "". Prices obtained under these circumstances reflect production costs associated with the entire range of production techniques in use, rather than those associated with only the "" marginal "" technique. These prices do not in general equal marginal costs (and they do not equate supply and demand) so it is hardly surprising that Western economists are sceptical about their efficacy. In particular, because prices of intermediate goods do not reflect their relative economic scarcity, one would expect the Soviet pricing policy to have an adverse impact on technological choice. Nevertheless, I believe that Soviet pricing policy does not inherently result in inefficient production. With the aid of a mathematical model designed to resemble certain aspects of the Soviet economic framework, I shall argue that the Soviet pricing policy will, under certain conditions, tend to promote the adoption of optimal production techniques.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a43_3ay_3a1976_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a413-421..htm,10.2307/2297217

2361,Review of Economic Studies,"Money, Expectations and the Existence of a Temporary Equilibrium",['Bryce Hool'],"1976, vol. 43, issue 3, 439-445",[],"If money and financial assets are to be integrated into general equilibrium theory, it is apparent that the classical Arrow-Debreu framework must be modified. As long as all trading takes place essentially at some initial point in time, with each individual subject only to a present value budget constraint, there is no place in the system for money, either as a medium of exchange or as a store of value, even if uncertainty about future states of the world is introduced as in Debreu [2], for example. It is natural then to consider an economy with sequential trading, and the appropriate Walrasian equilibrium concept becomes the Hicksian temporary equilibrium. This framework underlies the analysis of Patinkin [11] and has been formally developed by several authors, including Grandmont [4], Green [6], Sondermann [12] and Stigum [13, 14]. Clower [1] has pointed out that the classical budget constraint used in neo-Walrasian monetary theory, with money appearing symmetrically with consumption goods, is an inadequate representation of the trading opportunities available to an individual in a monetary economy. Being analytically indistinguishable from other commodities, money plays no essential role in the exchange process. Clower proposed a dichotomized budget constraint to characterize money expenditure and money income; the expenditure constraint requires that the cost of an individual's purchases in a given period does not exceed his initial cash balance. Grandmont and Younes [5] introduced into the Walrasian framework a modification of Clower's expenditure constraint, allowing an individual trader to have access to a fraction of the total proceeds from his sales in the current period. However, their proof of existence of a temporary monetary equilibrium (hereafter TME) does not cover the case where the fraction is zero (Clower's specification). They also employ the very restrictive assumption of "" tight expectations "" (see below, Section 3), an assumption which has been standard in previous proofs of existence of a TME. (See, for example, Grandmont [4] and Sondermann [12].) It rules out expectations with unitary elasticity and so the case where current prices are expected to hold in the future (as in Patinkin [11]). In this paper it is shown that, if the actual "" Clower"" constraint is used to introduce into the Walrasian model the requirement that money be used as the medium of exchange, it is possible to demonstrate the existence of a TME with a much weaker restriction on expectations. More precisely, it is shown that the class of price expectations consistent with the existence of a TME includes expectations with elasticity up to and including unity. If the expenditure constraint is added to the basic Patinkin model we can establish the existence of a short-run equilibrium in that model, subject to a mild condition on initial endowments expressing the desirability of an intertemporal transfer of wealth. In economic terms, the problem is to establish the existence of an equilibrium in which",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a43_3ay_3a1976_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a439-445..htm,10.2307/2297220

It is shown here that such a social welfare function must be dictatorial even if there is only one m-tuple of preferences in the domain if it is neutral, Pareto consistent and there are enough alternatives so that in one m-tuple of preferences there is diversity of preference among the alternatives. Although Arrow did not require neutrality, it is a logical consequence of his conditions. In the second section we argue that this result shows that the Bergson-Samuelson welfare function is dictatorial. Samuelson [7] and Plott [5] argue that the Arrow theorem really has nothing to do with the Bergson problem since Bergson assumes that the preferences of the society are fixed. In fact, Samuelson argues that there are as many Bergson functions as there are m-tuples of preferences in the domain of Arrow's function, and hence the impossibility theorem has nothing to do with Bergson's welfare function.

2365,Review of Economic Studies,Exact Measures of Welfare and the Cost of Living,"['George McKenzie', 'Ivor Pearce']","1976, vol. 43, issue 3, 465-468",[],"1. To evaluate the effects of any economic policy upon a single individual, it is necessary to be able to write some well-defined cardinal index of that individual's ordinal utility solely in terms of observable information: prices pi, quantities consumed Xi, money expenditure Y and the parameters of his demand function. Consumer's surplus measures and index numbers all represent attempts at achieving this aim, but all suffer from wellknown weaknesses which render their general application rather suspect.' Many economists have argued that since no other techniques are available, such measures, principally consumer's surplus, must nevertheless be resorted to if any practical policy recommendations are to be made at all. However, an alternative does exist. In this paper, we show how an exact measure may be derived, free of all undesirable restrictions, capable of defining, for the individual consumer, a precise ordering of social states, however close in the ordering any alternative states may be. A numerical example illustrates the superiority of the new approach over the more traditional welfare indicators. 2. In essence the problem is as follows. Suppose that the individual consumer possesses a preference function U(X1, ..., XJ), that we do not know its functional form, but that we do know the commodity demand functions associated with it. Utilizing the first-order maximizing conditions, we can derive expressions for local changes in consumer satisfaction, dU = A)pidXi, or equivalently dU = A(dY-ZXidpi) where A is the marginal utility of money, a non-observable. Since A is always positive, for small changes we can simply use as a welfare index, YpidXi or dY-ZXidpi. Either version can be interpreted as measuring an infinitesimal change in consumer's surplus. Alternatively, the former expression may be called a "" quantity variation"" whereas the latter, assuming that expenditure is unchanged, may be labelled a "" price variation "". For discrete changes in the variables, however, such measures are no longer applicable. Quantity or price variations written in Laspeyres and Paasche form are subject to "" regions of ignorance "". The addition of the well-known consumer's surplus triangle in an attempt to construct an ""approximate"" discrete welfare indicator suffers from the same drawback.2 3. We could, however, do the following. Substitute into the above differential equations, the observed inverse and ordinary demand functions for pi and Xi respectively. Then the problem becomes one of finding some integrating factor A, equal to the marginal utility of money, such that the differential equations are integrable.3 In other words, if we can find such a A, we can retrieve the underlying preference function from our knowledge of the consumer's demand functions. Since we have assumed U to exist in the first place, we know that A will also exist and that it will be a function of the variables and parameters describing the individual's demand functions. Although i itself is not directly observable, it is, in principle, derivable from information that is known. Further, an infinity of i's could be derived, each one generating a preference function that is a monotonic transformation of any other in the family. The drawback to this procedure is that there exist no general rules for deriving even one of the many integrating factors. As a result, a long and tedious search procedure may have to be endured.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a43_3ay_3a1976_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a465-468..htm,10.2307/2297224

2367,Review of Economic Studies,Portfolio Adjustment and Monetary Growth,['Lewis Johnson'],"1976, vol. 43, issue 3, 475-481",[],"A common feature of disequilibrium monetary growth models (those in which markets need not be cleared at any given moment in time) is the assumption of a simple portfolio adjustment process which generates a flow demand for money from a discrepancy between desired and actual holdings of real balances. However, some care must be taken in incorporating this process into the specification of asset market equilibrium. An implication of the portfolio adjustment process that has been uniformly overlooked is that anticipated real balance flows (e.g. due to inflation or government transfers) during the adjustment period will alter the extent to which wealth holders will need to enter the market to achieve a given adjustment. This is significant because the anticipated accommodation of desired reductions in real balances by inflation during the period of adjustment is potentially an important stabilizing force. As will be shown, this stabilizing force may be sufficiently potent to permit stability of an equilibrium growth model even if inflationary expectations are formed with perfect foresight (a possibility that is excluded in the existing literature). Thus the dynamics of monetary growth have been misunderstood. The insight that there must be sufficient friction in the system if the economy is to be stable is correct, but it has been overlooked that the portfolio adjustment process itself may be capable of providing that friction. It will be sufficient to examine a simple model with three markets, for money, bonds and goods (on the assumption that the wage rate adjusts to continually clear the labour market). It will be apparent that the results generalize to more elaborate economies. The model utilized will be sufficiently general to include several important classes of monetary growth models (in terms of adjustment processes) as special cases, and it will be shown that proper specification of asset market equilibrium will significantly relax the stability conditions in all of these cases.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a43_3ay_3a1976_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a475-481..htm,10.2307/2297226

Strotz restricted his analysis to the case where the discount function was time distance dependent. We require only that it be dependent on both the time of consumption and the planning date. Subsequently it is shown that necessary and sufficient conditions for consistent naive intertemporal decision making are multiplicative separability of a in time (t) and the planning date (X).",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a43_3ay_3a1976_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a547-549..htm,10.2307/2297234

Thomas'],"1976, vol. 43, issue 3, 551-552",[],"Eatwell, Llewellyn and Tarling [1] present what they regard as empirical support for the "" key industry "" hypothesis of the determination of money wage inflation. A 15 country cross-section for the period 1958-67 is used to test the theory that the rate of wage change in a country's manufacturing sector is dependent on productivity growth in a key sector of the three industries with the highest rate of productivity growth. However, it is not at all clear that the key industries are the pace setters as far as earnings growth is concerned. For Sweden, for example, the key industries include Petroleum and Chemicals, yet the rate of earnings growth in these industries is only 7l57-almost the lowest of the growth rates for Swedish industries. For Japan, earnings growth in the key industries is less than in manufacturing industry as a whole and for one key industry-Basic Metals-is only 7l86 compared with the overall manufacturing average of 9l88. Overall in the 15 countries considered by Eatwell et al., eight have key industries with earnings growth below the manufacturing average. This being so, it is difficult to regard these industries as being pace setters for the rest of manufacturing industry. These findings suggest that the high correlation found by Eatwell et al. between W and Z3 is misleading and that alternative explanations of the data should be considered. In this note it is shown that variations in cross-country rates of wage inflation can be satisfactorily explained by variations in such traditional Phillips curve variables as the level of unemployment and the extent of unionization. A serious problem in any cross-country study of unemployment rates is that of finding comparable data. European figures are usually based on unemployment registrations while US data, for example, are based on sample surveys which generally lead to higher recorded unemployment series. Maddison ([2, p. 220]), however, provides a consistent set of data for the period 1950-60 which are adjusted to a labour force sample survey basis. The data cover nine of the 15 countries considered by Eatwell et al.-Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, UK and US. Figures for the period 1958-67 were obtained by applying to the official 1958-67 series the ratio between the 1950-60 Maddison series and 1950-60 official series. Three other countries-Finland, Norway and Japan-publish official series which are based on labour force sample surveys. Thus comparable data is available for 12 of the 15 countries in Eatwell et al.'s cross-section.

2382,Review of Economic Studies,Investment and Trade for a Developing Economy with Economies of Scale in Industry,['Gordon Hughes'],"1976, vol. 43, issue 2, 237-248",[],"Economists have long been aware of the importance of increasing returns to scale in many activities, and particularly as the partial determinant of trade patterns. However, the technical problems which arise in attempting to formulate and solve economic models incorporating increasing returns-or, similarly, externalities-are formidable and have led to a concentration on other issues which can be analysed using convex theory. Some of the most interesting problems which are presented by economies of scale concern the nature and scheduling of investment, and thus one of the primary justifications of planning has been the need to take best advantage of increasing returns and externalities. Recently some work on these problems has been done by Weitzman [6], Dixit, Mirrlees and Stern [3], and in a quantitatively-oriented model by Westphal [8]. The present paper is a further attempt to examine planning with increasing returns to scale. It differs from those mentioned in its explicit introduction of trade and in the fact that the economies of scale do not depend on the size of plant, but on the scale of industrial production. This last feature means that the analysis does not focus on the lumpiness of investments, but rather on the inter-industry ramifications of increasing returns. The model specified depicts an underdeveloped country which is gradually investing to build up its industrial sector. Trade is vital to such a country both for the import of capital goods and in order to relieve it of the need to build up all industries in such a way as to balance supply with domestic demand for consumption and inter-industry input requirements. For convenience it is assumed that all capital goods are imported; this interpretation is not, in fact, restrictive because we could view the export surplus as measuring the domestic resources available for investment purposes. The model has been set up to focus our attention on the investment allocation problem in such an economy. For this reason we assume that capital is non-shiftable between industries; in other words once capital has been invested in industry i it cannot subsequently be transferred to industry j. This is not an unreasonable assumption when considering underdeveloped countries, and has the virtue that it emphasizes the inter-industry aspects of development rather than aggregative savings/ investment behaviour. A further feature of the model which emphasizes these issues is the assumption that there is no substitution in production processes, which are specified in terms of known input requirements per unit of output. These input needs fall as output is increased-hence the economies of scale. In fact, one could interpret the reasons underlying the decline in input coefficients rather broadly to incorporate a variety of external economies, learning, or some form of technical progress. Clearly these possibilities could be expanded upon for discussion in their own right, but it suffices for present purposes to use the all-embracing term of increasing returns. Though the usual analytical techniques of optimal control theory do not give sufficient conditions for the optimal path, they do provide ample information about necessary",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a43_3ay_3a1976_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a237-248..htm,10.2307/2297320
2383,Review of Economic Studies,Optimal Policy Rules for a Temporary Incomes Policy,['Franklin R. Shupp'],"1976, vol. 43, issue 2, 249-259",[],"In this study policy rules for a temporary incomes policy are identified and examined. The Pontryagin minimum principle is used to derive these rules which are optimal with respect to the posited criterion function and a simple but plausible wage-price inflation model. The principle assumption of the underlying model is that the relevant inflation is sustained by an inflationary psychology, characterized by expectations of continuing price and wage increases. Temporary wage-price controls by dampening these expectations serve to constrain the inflation. The derived policy rules provide for (i) a reduction in price inflation to some acceptable level, (ii) an equitable distribution of any restraining impact on wages, interest rates, and profits, and (iii) terminal characteristics which minimize the possibility of the reintroduction of an explosive wage-price spiral once controls are suspended. An inherent conflict between these objectives, particularly between (ii) and (iii), implies both a variable coefficient policy rule which differs substantially from most plausible ad hoc rules and a minimum length control horizon, which can not be reduced without incurring significant social costs. In addition, the paper considers the very significant differences in the impact of policies focusing on direct wage controls and those emphasizing direct price controls. In particular, direct price controls prove to be more attractive than direct wage controls whenever it can be established that firms respond more quickly in offsetting wage increases than workers do in offsetting price increases. (This appears to be the case empirically.) This conclusion must be carefully qualified, however, because the model also implies that good direct price controls are necessarily more complex and involve larger administrative costs.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a43_3ay_3a1976_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a249-259..htm,10.2307/2297321

2385,Review of Economic Studies,Monetary Equilibrium in Two Classes of Stationary Economies,['Toshihiko Hayashi'],"1976, vol. 43, issue 2, 269-284",[],"Seventy-five years ago Walras [18] called the determination of the equilibrium price of money "" the fourth major problem of pure economics . The question has received renewed attention, since Hahn [8], from those who are serious about the micro-economic foundations of monetary theory. Two rather different approaches have been taken so far. The first casts arguments in the framework of a single period exchange economy like Hayashi [9], Kurz [11] and Starr [17]. However, if the economy extends to only a finite number of periods, problems arise concerning the terminal "" scrap value "" of money. For this reason, Hayashi and Kurz considered only inside money economies, and, in the case of outside money economies, Starr needed a government to collect taxes in money, and Kurz needed a trader who is willing to offer his commodity endowment for money. It is hence clear that an explicit treatment of infinitely lasting economies is indispensable in order to solve the problem of the equilibrium value of money. Thus, Grandmont and Younes [6] and Grandmont and Laroque [5] envisaged the working of a monetary economy as an infinite succession of temporary equilibria, in which the future is only in the mind of individuals. However, there seems to be a weakness in such an approach. I.e., the temporary equilibrium model may give a good "" description "" of the reality of life-admittedly a very good one-however, in some cases it fails to "" explain"" why things are what they are. The issue at stake is the reason for the positive exchange value of paper money in a short-run equilibrium. Their argument is essentially as follows. If there is a trader who firmly believes that the price of money will be positive from the next period on no matter what may happen to its price in the current market, then money will be valued positively in the current market.2 This is only half a theory and leaves unexplained why the trader has come to harbour such an expectation. If one cannot take the expectation pattern as given, the alternative is to see what happens in the equilibrium over time in which all individuals' expectations materialize as time advances. In this respect, the discussion by Grandmont and others of long-run or stationary equilibrium is much more satisfactory because therein the agents correctly forecast the future owing to the stationarity of past observations. However, these authors conceive of money more as a vehicle to store value than as a chosen medium of exchange. They were unable to show the existence of a stationary monetary equilibrium in [5] for the case with k = 0, i.e. when money is the only medium of exchange. Furthermore, in [6] they assumed that contemporaneous transactions do not require the intermediation of money. It is due to this neglect of the role of money as medium of exchange that Grandmont, Younes and Laroque could not see clearly, though implicitly recognizing, the fundamental reason for monetary equilibrium.3 Thus the purpose of this paper is to construct a model of a monetary exchange economy based on the assumption that money is the sole exchange medium and to prove the existence of a stationary monetary equilibrium. In doing so we aim to demonstrate that the existence of a perfect foresight monetary equilibrium is closely related to the possibilities with which",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a43_3ay_3a1976_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a269-284..htm,10.2307/2297323

Using duality and results on functional structure, we provide in Section 3 the complete characterization which is needed to equate pairs of AES. The results of Russell and of Berndt and Christensen are then generated in a compact fashion as special cases; this highlights the interrelationships between the various assumptions which have been used. In Section 4 a stronger equality condition on the AES is examined. Again exploiting the theorems of duality and functional structure, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for this stronger equality condition to hold.

Planning procedures are of particular interest in such a case since, as it is well known, the pure non-cooperative competitive mechanism generally leads to inefficient situations in the presence of public goods. Although the solutions proposed by these two procedures to the problem of production and exchange of private goods are very different, they both adopt the same rules for the revision of the public goods quantities. Therefore in the model with only one private good which is considered throughout this paper the two procedures coincide and we shall call it the MDP procedure. The MDP procedure enjoys two properties which justify its study. During the procedure a social surplus appears which can be redistributed among consumers so as to permit an increase in all utility levels-i.e. the procedure is monotonic. Moreover, under usual convexity assumptions the procedure converges to an efficient (or Pareto optimal) situation -i.e. it is stable. Knowing that an efficient situation will obtain if the MDP procedure is implemented, a further question arises. What efficient situations can be reached in such a way? This paper gives conditions under which the following answer holds. Every efficient situation which is preferred or equivalent to the initial situation can be reached by the use of the MDP procedure with a suitable choice of the distribution of the social surplus appearing during the procedure. This choice can be made before the beginning of the procedure and can be kept constant along the procedure. Therefore any negotiation taking place before the beginning of the procedure can legitimately be concentrated upon the choice of a distribution of this surplus. Nobody can object to the rules followed in the revision of the public goods quantities since these rules do not have by themselves any distributive implications. We can say that they are "" neutral "". The model and the MDP procedure are described in Section 2. A precise definition of "" neutrality "" and the main results of the paper are presented and discussed in Section 3. Finally, the proofs are given in Section 4.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a43_3ay_3a1976_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a293-299..htm,10.2307/2297325

While the policy maker may be familiar with his current constraints (technological, market, organizational, political), he may find it difficult to specify them for "" optima"" that differ markedly from his past experience. Moreover, the organizational and/or political structure may be such that any really substantial change accomplished over a short time span is out of the question.

2394,Review of Economic Studies,Imperfect Competition and the Resource Allocative Effects of Effective Protection,['Edward John Ray'],"1976, vol. 43, issue 2, 363-368",[],"Given the importance of intermediate goods as inputs into production and in international trade flows, Corden [10] and others have argued that calculating effective rates of protection would yield more accurate information on the resource allocative effects of a given tariff structure than would calculations of nominal tariff rates. Subsequently, a number of authors have attempted to clarify the conditions under which particular measures of effective protection would be appropriate-appropriate in the sense of correctly indicating the resource allocative effects of a particular tariff structure. The principal concern has been to define an appropriate measure of effective protection when the input-output coefficients of intermediate inputs are variable. In fact, [1], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14] are but a few of the papers that have dealt with this question. A second major direction for enquiry has been the exchange rate effects of increasing or decreasing tariff protection. For example, [3], [11], [17] and [18] contributed to this literature and to the development of the concept of net effective protective rates. Recent work, including [3], [9], [11] and [19] has shed light on the affect of the existence of nontraded intermediate inputs on the formulation of an appropriate measure of effective protection. Finally [23] and [25] developed extensions of effective protection theory under general equilibrium conditions. The purpose of this note is to explore the effects of imperfect competition in input and output markets on the appropriateness of currently used measures of effective protection. Our simple contention is that market imperfections are as relevant and significant in their impact on whether or not effective protective rates will reveal the resource allocative effects of a given tariff policy as any of the factors already mentioned. To illustrate this point, we present a simple two-commodity, two-factor model in which each commodity is a fixed coefficient intermediate input into the production of the other. We assume that domestic production of importables occurs under conditions of pure monopoly. Under these conditions, we show that a tariff change leads to ambiguous results. The effect of tariff changes on the allocation of resources when factor markets are imperfectly competitive is explored in Section 2. Assuming that a labour union maintains wages in the importable goods sector at some fixed proportion above the wage rate in the production of exportables, we again demonstrate that the effects of a given tariff change on factor allocation, and production levels are uncertain.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a43_3ay_3a1976_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a363-368..htm,10.2307/2297332

We are concerned in Sections 1 to 5 to analyse the way in which these difficulties arise and to argue that the way in which "" Liberalism "" is inserted into the problem has much to answer for. In Section 6 we propose a radically different way of incorporating "" Liberalism ""-an arguably more plausible waywhich does not lead to these difficulties. There is a set S of possible social states, each of which is "" a complete description of society, including every individual's place in it "". Each individual i, i = 1, 2, ..., M, has a preference ordering Ri over S; an ordering is by definition complete, reflexive and transitive. The symbol Ri is used (without ambiguity) both to denote the ordering and in propositions like "" xRiy "" to denote pairwise preferences. The related symbols Pi and Ii are similarly used. A collective choice rule C is a function determining, for each M-tuple (R1, R2, ..., RM) of orderings on S a social preference relation R on S. (Again, R, P, and I are also used to denote pairwise preferences.) The properties of R are not specified, but for R to be either an ordering or a choice function it is necessary that it be acyclic. The authors quoted above show that, if "" Liberalism "" is introduced in a particular way, cycles of the form "" x1Px2, x2Px3, ..., xnPx1 "" can be generated, violating acyclicity.

2398,Review of Economic Studies,Counter-threats and Strategic Manipulation under Voting Schemes,['Prasanta K. Pattanaik'],"1976, vol. 43, issue 1, 11-18",[],"Gibbard [5] has shown that if there are at least three possible outcomes, then every nondictatorial "" voting scheme "" (i.e. every non-dictatorial group decision procedure which yields exactly one outcome for every voting situation and every issue) leaves scope for strategic misrepresentation of preferences by individuals.' This has serious implications. For, the sanctity of social decisions can be upheld only in so far as these decisions are based on the true or sincere preferences of individuals in the society. Social decisions based on distorted versions of individual preferences lose this sanctity, whatever be the ethical appeal of the method of aggregating the individuals' expressed preferences so as to arrive at the social decision. Thus Gibbard's result is of great importance. However, the structure within which Gibbard proves his result is relatively simple in so far as it does not include the phenomenon of possible counter-coalitions when a coalition (of one or more than one individual) threatens to disrupt a voting situation by strategic manipulations. In actual life the stability of a given voting situation (i.e. the absence of any strategic manipulation by any coalition, which will disrupt the voting situation) is often the result of a counterbalancing of "" threats "" and "" counter-threats ,2 (or coalitions and counter-coalitions). The purpose of this paper is to incorporate this element into the analysis and to explore the consequences of this wider framework for the theorem proved by Gibbard.3 It turns out that this negative result remains practically intact even within the more general framework. It is shown that even when we use a notion of stability which takes into account the possibility of counter-threats (and which is, to that extent, weaker than the stability notion underlying Gibbard's analysis), for every non-dictatorial voting scheme satisfying some very mild conditions, there exist sincere voting situations which are unstable because of strategic voting by single individuals. This essentially strengthens the negative impact of Gibbard's theorem since even the fear of a counter-coalition from the rest of the group does not rule out strategic or non-sincere voting by a single individual under, practically any non-dictatorial voting scheme in which one is likely to be interested.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a43_3ay_3a1976_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a11-18..htm,10.2307/2296596
2399,Review of Economic Studies,Real National Income,['Amartya Sen'],"1976, vol. 43, issue 1, 19-39",[],"Real national income comparison is one of the most frequently performed exercises in empirical economics. While the welfare implications of such comparisons are often not spelt out, there is little doubt that the significance that is attached to comparisons of real national income depend greatly on their implicit welfare content. This also influences the statistical procedures that are chosen, and as has been observed, "" the basic conventions that have been adopted by the statisticians of most countries for purposes of GNP-measurement are still founded on some notion of what measure of economic activity can best represent the contribution of that activity to welfare "". (Beckerman [2], p. 80). The welfare theory of real national income comparisons is, however, incomplete in several important ways, despite outstanding contributions by several distinguished economists, including Hicks [17], [18], Scitovsky [40], Kuznets [24], Samuelson [38], [39], Little [26] and Graaff [12], among others. Perhaps the most serious difficulty is with the treatment of income distribution. The starting point of thispaper lies in treating the same commodity going to two different persons as two different goods. The weighting of "" goods "", thus defined, will incorporate distributional judgements. (The approach presented in this paper is best seen in the context of Graaff's [12] analysis of the need to "" dispense with the time-honoured device of drawing a distinction between the size and the distribution of the national income and saying that welfare depends upon them both "", and his penetrating observation that welfare ""depends (if we must use the term) on size only-and we do not know what the size is until we know the distribution"" ([12], p. 92).) This will permit a welfare interpretation of real income comparisons without the usual restrictive assumptions, e.g. leaving out distributional considerations explicitly (cf. Hicks [17], [18]), or making the peculiarly unrealistic assumption that distribution is made "" optimal"" by lump-sum transfers (cf. Samuelson [38], pp. 28-29, [39]). The important point to note is that typically social welfare can be seen to be a function of the vector of "" goods "" as defined here, but not as a function of the vector of commodities in the usual sense (i.e. irrespective of who gets them). Another departure lies in the explicit recognition of the fact that real national income comparisons involve different groups of people.' In this, these comparisons differ from traditional welfare economics (e.g. the use of "" Pareto Optimality "" or of "" Compensation Tests ""), collective choice theory, (e.g. the use of Arrowian "" social welfare functions ""), and the standard theory of national planning (e.g. "" cost-benefit analysis "", or "" optimal growth theory ""), which are concerned with comparing alternative positions of the same group of people. One way of avoiding the complex problems of inter-group contrasts is to confine real income comparisons to contrasting the actual position of a group with what its position "" would have been "" if it were plhced in the position of another group. (Cf. Pigou: "" If the German population with German tastes were given the national dividend of England, . . ."" [34], pp. 52-53.) But this problem is ill-defined. For two groups of n people each, there are n! different ways of placing one group in the position of another. And, for two groups of different sizes, the interpretation of such "" as if"" comparisons is totally ambiguous.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a43_3ay_3a1976_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a19-39..htm,10.2307/2296597

A Nash [11] non-cooperative equilibrium for this model, in which the equilibrium strategies were reaction functions, would be characterized by n reaction functions (xt), ..., +P*(xt), one for each firm, which have the following property: For the ith firm, no sequence of prices, xit, xi,t+ , ... will yield a higher value for equation (1) than will Xi?= t4(x1) (' = t, t+ 1, ...), given that all other firms will choose their prices by Xjt = ql*(x,_1) in all periods. This condition holds.for i = 1, ..., n.1 The purpose of this paper is to establish conditions under which the equilibrium outlined above approximately exists. Thus this paper is in the reaction function tradition of oligopoly which has its earliest roots in Cournot [2] and its main early development at the hands of Bowley [1], Stackelberg [12] and Fellner [5].2 These writers worked with single period models of the firm, while discussing how the firms ought to behave given that they are really concerned with profits over a long time horizon. Taking explicit account that the firm's objective is to maximize a discounted stream of profits (as in equation (1) above) is first done, so far as I am aware, in my article on duopoly [6]. The present paper continues the research begun there and carried on in [7], [9]. While each of these papers makes steps in the direction of Nash type reaction function equilibria, existence was not proved in them for' any class of models, nor was any satisfactory "" approximate"" equilibrium found to exist; therefore, the present paper is an advance in this line of research.

Bhagwati [1] and Modigliani [6] present excellent surveys of various assumptions and strategies proposed by different authors in setting a "" limit price "" to prevent a new entry. The general conclusion is that an oligopolist can charge an entry-preventing price which is higher than the competitive price. Since the existing competition affects the firm's "" short run "" profit, while the "" long run "" profit is determined by potential competition, it seems reasonable that the firm should seek to maximize some weighted average of the two, as suggested by Hicks [4]. Consequently the optimal price should lie between the monopolistic price and the competitive one. These and similar other interesting conclusions about the optimal pricing strategies were also obtained by Gaskins [3] and Kamien and Schwartz [5] using the optimal control theory framework. In this paper we propose a semi-Markov decision model for determining a sequence of optimal prices to be charged and the corresponding long-run profit streams, along with their limiting behaviour as the number of firms in the industry tends to infinity.

2406,Review of Economic Studies,International Trade Theory in Vintage Models,['M. A. M. Smith'],"1976, vol. 43, issue 1, 99-113",[],"There are two main reasons why it is interesting to extend international trade theory to vintage capital models. (1) If one is concerned with the causes and effects of trade in actual machines, then it seems natural to use the vintage approach. This applies in particular to trade in secondhand machines, an issue which has been much discussed in the literature on development (see [9] section 1), where only in vintage models can one hope to capture the essential points. (2) Almost the entire theoretical literature on international trade assumes capital malleability, and much of it assumes a two-sector economy. If the results of this theorizing are attributable to the specific nature of the models used, then it is clear that one should not attach much significance to them. If, by contrast, it can be shown that the principal features of trade theory carry over to. alternative models of capitalist production, then the confidence with which we apply the theory to the real world should be strengthened. The vintage models discussed in this paper should be distinguished from the models of Bardhan [1], [2] and Petith [7]. Bardhan's model is a two-sector model with fixed proportions vintage production functions and no trade in used machines. It turns out to resemble very closely the two-sector model with differentiable production functions. Petith's model has no trade at all in capital goods: the vintage technology is used solely as an illustration of the effects of joint production. By contrast, it is of the essence of the models I discuss here that they are vintage models, there are no restrictions on trade, and, indeed, in dealing only with one-sector models my aim is to focus purely on the issues raised by trade across vintages. It must also be noted that my concern is with the effects of trade on growth. There is a considerable literature on the effects of growth on trade. (See Hanson [6] for a survey of this literature, and an attempt to consider both sets of effects together.) Since the models here have only one consumption good, nothing may be said on such important questions as the effects of capital accumulation on the relative prices of, say, primary and manufactured products.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a43_3ay_3a1976_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a99-113..htm,10.2307/2296604
2407,Review of Economic Studies,On the Incidence of Unemployment,['Costas Azariadis'],"1976, vol. 43, issue 1, 115-125",[],"An enduring characteristic of historical labour statistics is that the incidence of unemployment is consistently and substantially lower among skilled craftsmen than among simple labourers.1 Theories of this occupational differential in unemployment rates have focused on two aspects of the relationship between labour inputs-comparative variability and mutual substitutability. Oi [12], for instance, observes that, relative to the wage rate, fixed costs of hiring and training are much higher for skilled than for unskilled workers. The amortization of fixed expense forms a buffer between the wage rate and the value of labour's marginal product, and to some extent cushions the demand for skilled employees against abrupt shifts due to short-run fluctuations in the output market. Common labour largely lacks this protective shield and, consequently, bears the brunt of increases in the unemployment rate. Reder [13], [15], on the other hand, stresses the substitutability of skilled for unskilled workers. During recessions firms react to falling demand by tightening hiring standards and thus displacing some employees from each labour grade down the occupational skill ladder. This course of action would not be sensible without two crucial postulates: (i) the skilled rate is fully flexible, but variations in the unskilled labour rate are constrained by an exogenous floor, the "" social minimum rate "" [15, 312-313]; and (ii) craftsmen displaced down the skill ladder cannot or will not find a job commensurate with their skills in some other, non-depressed, sector of the economy.2 Clearly, then, if such theories of the labour market are to account for pure, excesssupply unemployment (e.g. layoffs), they must be supplemented by a strong postulate such as an exogenous stickiness in the wage rate. It is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate that occupational unemployment differentials can be explained in a short-run framework on considerably weaker assumptions. A market with two labour skill grades is characterized in Section 2 by a state-preference model which permits involuntary unemployment to occur at equilibrium. The crucial concept here is that labour services are not exchanged for (and job offers are not evaluated by) wages alone, but for implicit labour contracts which permit the market to form estimates of contingent unemployment probabilities. Rational substitution of skilled for unskilled workers is examined in Section 3 in the context of effective production. Sections 4 and 5 investigate the optimality of full-employment contracts and spell out the main result: at equilibrium, the expected rate of involuntary unemployment for common labour never falls short of, and usually exceeds, that for skilled labour. Consequently, layoffs by seniority may well represent rational behaviour on the part of the market rather than acquiescence to an arcane rule. The cyclical implications of these findings are examined in Section 6 and suggested extensions are laid out in the concluding section.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a43_3ay_3a1976_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a115-125..htm,10.2307/2296605

2409,Review of Economic Studies,The Le Chatelier Principle in Convex Programming,"['Gérald Leblanc', 'Paul  van Moeseke']","1976, vol. 43, issue 1, 143-147",[],"The Le Chatelier Principle, first applied in economics by Samuelson [11] many years ago, can be stated in the following way: if one alters one of the parameters (pressure, temperature, concentration of any one compound, etc.) of a system of physical or chemical equilibrium, the remaining parameters will adjust so as to counteract the disturbance. The interpretation of the Lagrange multipliers (or dual variables) as a price system for available resources is well known [1], [3], [8]. If we suppose that the quantity of one of the available resources changes, one would expect, by the Le Chatelier Principle, that its price changes in the opposite direction. We can then show that the marginal value of a resource increases if its amount is reduced, and vice versa. This property, shown in Proposition 1, will be called the Le Chatelier Principle I. We can also state, as a corollary to this principle, an equivalent property for the levels of an activity. Using a recent generalization, by Rockafellar [10], of the Kuhn-Tucker conditions for non-differentiable convex functions (but admitting subgradients), we demonstrate that if the marginal cost (in terms of resource inputs) of an activity decreases, the level of this activity is stepped up, and vice versa. This property will be called the Le Chatelier Principle II. In the last section we present a particular case to these two principles. Restricting ourselves to the class of homogeneous programming problems [8], we first show that globally, i.e. without any differentiability assumption, the traditional equality between the total factor payment and the total profit holds, and secondly that the perturbation function [4], [10] is a positively linear homogeneous function. As a consequence to these properties, it follows that the dual variables remain unchanged for proportional variations of the parameters.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a43_3ay_3a1976_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a143-147..htm,10.2307/2296607
2410,Review of Economic Studies,Rational Choice and Revealed Preference,['Kotaro Suzumura'],"1976, vol. 43, issue 1, 149-158",[],"According to the currently dominant view, the choice behaviour of an agent is construed to be rational if there exists a preference relation R such that, for every set S of available states, the choice therefrom is the set of "" R-optimal "" points in S.' There are at least two alternative definitions of R-optimality-R-maximality and R-greatestness. On the one hand, an x in S is said to be R-maximal in S if there exists no y in S which is strictly preferred to x in terms of R. On the other, an x in S is said to be R-greatest in S if, for all y in S, x is at least as preferable as y in terms of R. The former viewpoint can claim its relevance in view of the prevalent adoption of the concept of Pareto-efficiency in the theory of resource allocation processes.2 The latter standpoint is deeply rooted in the well-developed theories of the integrability problem, revealed preference and social choice. The difference between these two definitions of rational choice is basically as follows. Any two states in a choice function which is R-maximal rational are either R-indifferent or R-incomparable, while any two states in a choice function which is R-greatest rational are R-indifferent. A condition for rational choice has been put forward in terms of the R-greatestness interpretation of optimality (Hansson [4] and Richter [9, 10]). In this paper, a condition for rational choice in its R-maximality interpretation will be presented. The condition in question will, in a certain sense, synthesize both concepts of rationality, because it can be seen that the rational choice in terms of R-maximality is rational in terms of R-greatestness as well. The role of various axioms of revealed preference and congruence in the theory of rational choice will also be clarified. In this kind of analysis, special care should be taken with the domain of the choice function. It was Arrow [1] who first suggested that "" the demand-function point of view would be greatly simplified if the range over which the choice functions are considered to be determined is broadened to include all finite sets "". This line of enquiry was recently completed by Sen [13].' It is true, as was persuasively discussed by Sen [13, Section 6], that there is no convincing reason for our restricting the domain of the choice function to the class of convex polyhedras representing budget sets in the commodity space. At the same time, however, it should be admitted that there exists no specific reason for our extending the domain so as to include all finite sets. This being the case, no restriction whatsoever will be placed on the domain of the choice function in this paper except that it should be a non-empty family of non-empty sets. In Section 2, our conceptual framework will be presented. The main results will be stated in Section 3, proofs thereof being given in Section 4. In Section 5 we will present some examples which will negate the converse of our theorems. Finally, Section 6 will be devoted to comparing our results with the Arrow-Sen theory, on the one hand, and the Richter-Hansson theory, on the other.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a43_3ay_3a1976_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a149-158..htm,10.2307/2296608
2411,Review of Economic Studies,Changing Tastes and Coherent Dynamic Choice,['Peter Hammond'],"1976, vol. 43, issue 1, 159-173",[],"Consider any economic agent who is choosing a plan which is going to take some time to implement. Examples are a firm undertaking a long-term investment project, a consumer contemplating the choice of a superannuation scheme, and a department of government making any kind of longor even medium-term plan for the future. Before such a plan has been fully implemented, there is plenty of time in which the agent has the chance to change his mind and, perhaps, the plan he originally chose. If his plan does change, there is, prima facie, an instance of inconsistent choice. It is a convenient shorthand to describe this as a problem of changing tastes, even though this suggests an unintended limitation of the phenomenon to consumer choice. Changing tastes have been separated into two categories: exogenously changing tastes, and endogenously changing tastes. Most previous work has considered one aspect or the other, yet the distinction is unhelpful and one that will be abandoned in this paper. The first work on exogenously changing tastes was by Allais [2]. He considered the welfare implications of a consumer regretting his earlier choices; however, he specifically restricted his discussion to tastes which never give rise to changing or inconsistent choices (as explained in [7], Appendix 2) (see also [15], [16]). Strotz's [26] paper is a discussion of the consistency problem for a particular type of consumer planning his savings over a finite time-interval; it has been followed by Pollak [19], and by Blackorby, Nissen, Primont and Russell [3] (see also Heal [11], Section 10.2). The latter considered the general problem of a consumer with exogenously changing tastes making choices from budget sets. Finally, Peleg and Yaari [17] discuss certain existence problems.

2416,Review of Economic Studies,Optimal Stabilization Policies for Stochastic Linear Systems: The Case of Correlated Multiplicative and Additive Disturbances,['Stephen J Turnovsky'],"1976, vol. 43, issue 1, 191-194",[],"In their comment on my paper [4], Chang and Stekler [2] make two points. First, they show that had I begun by specifying the stochastic version of the model in level form, in which the additive and multiplicative disturbances are uncorrelated, the corresponding disturbances in the derived deviation equation would necessarily have been correlated. This would have led to an adjustment of the control law derived in [4]. Secondly, they indicate how, using a discrete time approximation to the continuous time stochastic processes, they can treat the case where both the multiplier coefficient and the accelerator coefficient are stochastic simultaneously. In my paper I assumed, largely for convenience (but without considering the full implications), that the multiplicative and additive disturbances of the equation specified in deviation form are uncorrelated. The optimal stabilization policy was then derived by applying some results due to Wonham [6]. While one is quite at liberty to begin directly with a stochastic specification in deviation form, in most economic applications it is more natural to postulate the underlying relation (or set of relations) in levels and to transform the system to deviations in the process of deriving the solution. In view of the ChangStekler observation that such a transformation will almost inevitably induce correlation between the additive and multiplicative disturbances, it becomes important to extend the theory of optimal linear stabilization policy to include this case. This is the purpose of the present note. We shall develop the policy using discrete time. As well as being probably more relevant for short-run stabilization problems, this has the important advantage that the stochastic disturbances need not be white noise. Thus the stochastic terms appearing in the dynamics of the system could be composite expressions, such as products, enabling us to treat any nuimber of stochastic disturbances simultaneously, in a similar fashion to Chang and Stekler. Unlike them, however, we are not viewing the discrete formulation as being an approximation to any continuous process. The nature of the problem can be seen by considering the following first-order linear stochastic system, specified in level form",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a43_3ay_3a1976_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a191-194..htm,10.2307/2296614

It is our purpose in this paper to present concepts and tools permitting study of the functioning and properties of a decentralized monetary economy3 at disequilibrium prices, in line with the work of Clower [9] [10] and Leijonhufvud [30] [31].4 The usual concept of demand is no longer valid as soon as we do not assume instantaneous adjustment of prices to their equilibrium values; if economic agents behave rationally, it must be replaced by a new concept, that of effective demand, introduced by Clower [9] taking into account quantity constraints as well as prices (the prototype of which is the consumption function). Further, interaction between individuals on the different markets gives rise not only to price adjustments (as in the standard Walrasian model), but to quantity adjustments very similar to the traditional dynamic multiplier, as described by Leijonhufvud [30] (the "" income constrained process ""). A number of authors have successfully used this approach to describe macro-economic phenomena within the framework of simple equilibrium models (Barro-Grossman [2] [3], Glustoff [15], Grossman [21] [22], Solow-Stiglitz [36]). However, these simplified formulations can handle no more than one or two goods in disequilibrium, and we would like here to reformulate the above concepts in the usual framework of General Equilibrium analysis.5 So in what follows we shall study a general exchange economy "" A la Debreu "" with money in disequilibrium (production can be incorporated in the analysis without difficulty: Benassy [4] [7]). In this framework we shall formalize the effective demand concept, define Keynesian equilibria and prove their existence. We shall also prove an important result of Keynesian analysis: at non-Walrasian prices, multiplier effects associated with the monetary structure of exchange are responsible for the "" inefficiency "" of many Keynesian",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a42_3ay_3a1975_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a503-523..htm,10.2307/2296791

It has come to be held, therefore, that a necessary concomitant of an incomes policy is the establishment of some body or Commission to consider specifically what the appropriate relativities are, and to allow corresponding exceptions to the guideline or the freeze. Of course, for such a remedy to work there must be some consensus as to what criterion the Commission should use in assessing relativities and acceptance of the results of its deliberations.

For convenience we refer to allocations which satisfy both these criteria as groupwise Pareto efficient (GPE) allocations. We present here a number of theorems which show conditions under which sequences of such GPE allocations bring the economy (close) to overall Pareto efficiency, i.e. to an allocation which cannot be improved upon by any group of traders. We prove these theorems in three stages. (a) Section 4. Here we pose the question: If an allocation is GPE for the permitted trading groups is it overall Pareto efficient?

Previous literature has considered the question of existence of equilibrium for such models (Arrow and Hahn [1], McKenzie [3], Osana [4] and Scheffman [5]), and has examined the topological properties of the set of feasible allocations (Osana [4]). The focus of our investigation will be to formulate the question: "" How are static general equilibrium models with externalities different from such models without externalities? "" in a manner for which we can provide a concise answer. The purpose of our investigation is to increase our understanding of the effects of externalities in static general equilibrium models. We will confine ourselves to static models because of course the dynamics of even models without externalities is not sufficiently well understood. The model we will use is similar to the one presented in Osana [4], except for one important difference: we will not net out intermediate goods by considering only net input-output vectors. It is important to consider intermediate goods explicitly in models with externalities, since intermediate goods are often direct sources of externalities. Stripped to its bare bones, the modern general equilibrium model consists of a compact convex set of feasible net allocations and an aggregate excess demand correspondence which is upper semicontinuous and convex-valued. From a static viewpoint, then, the way to formulate our central question is to ask: "" How are the net feasible set and aggregate excess demand correspondence different in models with externalities?"" Osana [4] has verified (under reasonable assumptions) that the net feasible set for models with externalities is compact. We will go further and establish that this set is not generally convex. This result is probably not surprising, and is at least implicit in much of the externality literature. Our basic contribution here is a concise revelation of the mathematical source of the non-convexities. We cannot immediately consider the aggregate excess demand correspondence for a model with externalities, because this concept has hitherto not been defined. The main contribution of this paper is to define what may reasonably be called the aggregate excess demand correspondence for models with externalities, and to establish its properties. In conclusion, we will present some interesting examples of non-convexities.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a42_3ay_3a1975_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a597-604..htm,10.2307/2296796

We say that certainty equivalence holds when the optimal solution is identical to the solution (the certainty equivalent) obtained through a maximization where all stochastic variables have been replaced by their expected values.

Hart'],"1975, vol. 42, issue 4, 615-621",[],"Consider an investor who has a certain amount of wealth to invest in a riskless security and several risky securities. The investor's optimal portfolio will depend on his attitudes towards risk, his wealth and the probability distribution of the security returns. An interesting question to ask is how the investor's optimal portfolio is affected by changes in his wealth, given that all other things remain constant. For example, does the total amount invested in risky securities increase as wealth increases? Does the proportion of wealth invested in risky securities decrease as wealth increases? Questions such as these have been investigated by Arrow [1, Chapter 3] in the case of one riskless security and one risky security. Arrow showed that if the investor's von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function exhibits decreasing absolute risk aversion and increasing relative risk aversion, the amount invested in the risky security is an increasing function of wealth and the proportion of wealth invested in the risky security is a decreasing function of wealth. More recently, Cass and Stiglitz [3] have shown that Arrow's results do not generalize to the case of many risky securities. They give an example where an investor who can purchase one riskless security and two risky securities invests a greater proportion of his wealth in the two risky securities when his wealth increases, even though his utility function exhibits increasing relative risk aversion. Cass and Stiglitz note, however, that Arrow's results do generalize for an important, if highly restrictive, class of utility functions-those for which the mix of risky securities in the investor's optimal portfolio is independent of the investor's wealth for all probability distributions of security returns. Such utility functions are said to possess the separation property. The purpose of this paper is to prove that the separation property is a necessary condition as well as a sufficient condition for the generalization of Arrow's results to the case of many risky securities. We will show that given more than one risky security and a utility function which does not possess the separation property, it is always possible to pick probability distributions for the returns of the risky securities so that the directions of change which Arrow established for the single risky security case are reversed; that is, for some probability distributions of security returns, the total amount invested in risky securities decreases as wealth increases, and for other probability distributions of security returns, the proportion of wealth invested in risky securities increases as wealth increases. In fact, we will show that there always exist probability distributions of security returns such that the amount (proportion of wealth) invested in every risky security decreases (increases) as wealth increases. It should be emphasized, moreover, that this is the case",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a42_3ay_3a1975_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a615-621..htm,10.2307/2296798

2427,Review of Economic Studies,On Stochastic Models of Size Distributions,['A. F. Shorrocks'],"1975, vol. 42, issue 4, 631-641",[],"A wide variety of size distributions, including individuals classified according to income or wealth and firms ranked by assets, sales or employment, are known to exhibit remarkably similar features. These common characteristics have led to speculation about the mechanism by which such distributions are generated and a number of possibilities have been explored. The most popular approach uses the techniques and results of probability theory and the models are consequently described as stochastic.3 Changes in size are assumed to be random, but the process generating these random jumps is defined in such a way that the probability distribution of future size can be derived. When the same process is assumed to apply for a large number of units (individuals or firms), the size distribution can be predicted. Particular attention has been paid to ergodic processes. These have an associated stationary state or equilibrium distribution to which every distribution converges over time. The stable equilibrium properties of this stationary state suggest that the system will usually be near equilibrium, so that the empirically observed distribution can be identified with the stationary state. The corollary to this argument is that a stochastic model is regarded as a possible explanation of an observed frequency distribution if the observed frequencies correspond approximately to those of the stationary state. The model introduced in the next section provides a convenient framework for examining the assumptions and implications of stochastic models. Based on the theory of queues and described in terms of wealth accumulation, it has a number of features which make it particularly suitable for analysis. An expression for the wealth distribution, or more precisely its probability generating function, can be derived explicitly at every point of time. In addition, for certain sets of parameter values the process is ergodic and there exists a unique stationary state to which the actual distribution converges over time. However, it is argued that the justification for the assumed correspondence between empirical distributions and stationary states is invalid. Although ergodicity ensures that the process eventually approaches equilibrium, it does not specify the speed at which this adjustment takes place. An examination of the convergence rates for a number of models suggests that this does not occur rapidly, and the process must therefore operate for a considerable period of time before the stationary state is approximated. In these circumstances the homogeneity assumption, requiring the parameters to remain unchanged, is untenable. There is a second and perhaps stronger reason for abandoning the homogeneity assumption and the properties of ergodic systems. A major criticism of these stochastic models has been their lack of economic content, a deficiency which is directly attributable to the preoccupation with processes exhibiting stable equilibria. Such models cannot include parameters which are determined exogenously and allowed to vary at any point in the process",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a42_3ay_3a1975_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a631-641..htm,10.2307/2296800

On the assumption that such institutions aim to maximize the expected utility of return from their portfolio, a model in the mean variance tradition is expounded. Symmetry, homogeneity and aggregation conditions analogous to those familiar from some variants of consumer theory are shown to hold. With additional assumptions relating to risk and expected rates of return, a system of demand equations is presented and estimated subject to the constraints implicit in the maximization process envisaged. However, while discussion of the estimates seems to imply the validity of the model, no rigorous test of any of the constraints employed in estimation appears in the paper, as it is argued that singularity of the residuals covariance matrix precludes "" an F test on the significance of the difference in the error sum of squares in regressions which impose restrictions compared with unrestricted regressions "" ([4], p. 487). Instead, the author resorts to examining whether the estimates derived from OLS regressions in which the intercepts, A = {ak}, have, as in the case of the constrained estimation, been suppressed,3 conflict pairwise with the symmetry of interest rate responses (i.e. G = 1 I 11 = G') condition. Yet, informative as these comparisons may be, one should not forget that from the standpoint of evaluation of the validity of the overall hypothesis, (RI), little interest attaches to the extent to which individual coefficients, or subsets of coefficients, meet the appropriate condition.

2429,Review of Economic Studies,An Important Theorem on Income Tax,['John Broome'],"1975, vol. 42, issue 4, 649-652",[],"It is not generally known that the best marginal rate of income tax is 58-6 per cent. Were this fact better publicized, economists would be spared a lot of trouble. I use the following assumptions. In case some of them do not look quite authentic, I have supplied a pedigree for each. (1) Each person has an "" income-earning ability "" n. If he works for a fraction y of the day, his gross income is ny. This is the standard model in the theory of optimal income tax. It originates in Mirrlees [4]. (2) The government considers only linear tax functions, so that after-tax income is x = any+b. a and b are chosen by the government. The marginal tax rate is (1-a), and b is the guaranteed minimum income. The assumption of linearity is made by Atkinson [1], by Feldstein [3] and by Sheshinski [6]. (Atkinson [2] also uses it, and compares the results with the more general case.) (3) The government has no expenditure of its own. It taxes only to redistribute. The same thing is assumed by Atkinson [1] and [2] and by Sheshinski [6]. See the note under "" Qualifications "" below. (4) The government's aim is to maximize the utility of the person with the least utility. Provided there are some people with an ability sufficiently small that they do not find it worthwhile to work, this comes to the same thing as maximizing b. The reason is that these are bound to be the people with the least utility, because anyone, whatever his ability, has the option of achieving the same utility as them simply by stopping working (see Phelps [5] for this argument in more detail). This "" maximin "" objective comes from Atkinson [2] and from Phelps. Its ancestry is well known to be of the highest breeding. (5) Everyone has the same utility function u = log x +log (1 -y). This is the function adopted by Mirrlees in his concrete examples. See the note under "" Qualifications"" below. (6) Only a few people have an ability less than 0414 of the mean ability.

2430,Review of Economic Studies,Optimum Saving with Economies of Scale,"['Avinash Dixit', 'James Mirrlees', 'Nicholas Stern']","1975, vol. 42, issue 3, 303-325",[],"There are many problems in economics where it is important to think of investment taking place in discrete lumps rather than as a continuous flow. These are usually problems where fixed costs are significant or, more generally, where there are economies of scale. An important example is the creation of a new centre of population which requires some large initial capital outlay. A second is that of an individual saver who makes investments at discrete points in time because there is some cost to the act of making an investment. The model that we investigate in this paper was originally motivated by the first of these examples. It has some limitations as a model of timing and size of new centres, however, and these are discussed later. It should be viewed as a first approach to that problem, though we suspect that better models will be similar in flavour. It turns out, however, that a special case of the model does capture the problem of the individual saver. The plan of the paper is as follows. Previous literature is discussed in this introduction. Then a growth model with economies of scale in the production of output, using capital but no labour, is presented. Conditions necessary for optimality are obtained, and some simple properties of the optimal path established. In Section 3 we show that in a simple special case the optimal policy is readily obtained, but takes the economy to infinite output in finite time. We then turn to the version appropriate to individual saving behaviour, with fixed transaction costs and a constant interest rate, showing how to identify the optimum policy and computing it for the iso-elastic utility case. Finally in Section 5 we introduce labour, retaining economies of scale, and solve the optimum growth problem for the Cobb-Douglas production function and iso-elastic utility. We conclude with some remarks on generalizations. A general existence theorem for optimum paths is given in an appendix. We would like to draw attention to the particular importance and difficulty of establishing which of the paths satisfying the necessary conditions actually is optimal. It is this problem together with that of proving existence of an optimum that make rigorous mathematics essential at some stages of the argument. Elsewhere we have not troubled to show that our arguments can be made rigorous.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a42_3ay_3a1975_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a303-325..htm,10.2307/2296847
2431,Review of Economic Studies,Asset Management with Trading Uncertainty,"['Duncan Foley', 'Martin Hellwig']","1975, vol. 42, issue 3, 327-346",[],"It is our purpose in this paper to explore the connections between uncertainties inherent in the trading process and the holding of liquid assets, with the idea that the techniques we develop here are a step toward a unified theory of money, price formation and the trading process. What we call "" trading uncertainty "" is uncertainty about an agent's immediate opportunities to buy and sell. It is inherent in the operation of real markets when information cannot be transmitted or processed costlessly. Trading uncertainty must be sharply distinguished from the uncertainty about the state of the world and the equilibrium price pertaining to it, which is treated in the theories of portfolio choice and market allocation of risk.3 State of the world uncertainty concerns events like changes in endowments, technology and tastes that are generally taken as exogenous from the point of view of the economic relations of production and exchange. The major theme of the theory of state of the world uncertainty is the ability of agents to reduce private riskiness by exchanging goods in different states of the world, that is, by insurance or hedging, to evade some or all of the possible risk. The central fact about trading uncertainty is that it cannot be traded away perfectly, since it is inherent in the trading process itself. It could be eliminated only in a world where the transmission and processing of information was costless. The picture of market equilibrium of conventional theory explicitly rules out trading uncertainty since agents are supposed to be able to buy or sell any amount of any good at a known price. Trading uncertainty may enter in two guises depending on whether one views market disequilibrium in "" Marshallian "" or "" Walrasian "" terms. There may be several prices coexisting in the market at any moment, so that agents do not face a single known price. Or there may be only one price, but if it is not an equilibrium price agents cannot all buy or sell any amounts they want to. If excess supply or excess demand is in part rationed randomly, then agents will face trading uncertainty about their ability to buy or sell. Costless and instantaneous transmission and processing of information would eliminate any divergence of price at a given moment, and would also presumably rule out trading at a disequilibrium price. This is the case studied by conventional theory (even with the",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a42_3ay_3a1975_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a327-346..htm,10.2307/2296848

However, the study of capital accumulation under uncertainty began much later and these analyses for the most part confined themselves to linear technologies. In his pioneering work, Phelps [19] and, later, Levhari and Srinivisan [10] ,Hahn [5] and Leland [23], examine the optimal consumption-saving decision under uncertainty with a given linear production technology. Hakansson [6], Leland [9] and Samuelson [21] in discrete time and Merton [12, 13] in continuous time, along with a host of other authors, have studied the combined consumption-saving-portfolio problem where the production functions are linear, but where there is a choice among alternative technologies. There have been a few notable exceptions to this concentration on linear technologies. In a seminal paper, Mirrlees [17] tackled the stochastic Ramsey problem in a continuoustime neoclassical one-sector model subject to uncertainty about technical progress. Later, in [18], he expanded his analysis to other types of technologies. Mirman [16] for positive savings functions and Brock and Mirman [1] for optimal savings functions, using a discrete-time, neoclassical one-sector model, proved the existence, uniqueness and stability of a steady-state (or asymptotic) distribution for the capital-labour ratio. These steadystate distributions are the natural generalizations under uncertainty to the golden-age/ golden-rule levels of the capital-labour ratio as deduced in the certainty case. While these papers are important contributions with respect to existence and uniqueness, they have little to say about the specific structure of these asymptotic distributions or about the biases (in an expected-value sense) induced by assuming a certainty model when, in fact, outcomes are uncertain. The basic model used in this paper is a one-sector neoclassical growth model of the Solow-type where the dynamics of the capital-labour ratio can be described by a diffusiontype stochastic process. The particular source of uncertainty chosen is the population size although the analysis would be equally applicable to technological or other sources of uncertainties. The first part of the paper analyses the stochastic processes and asymptotic distributions for various economic variables, for an exogeneously given savings function, and deduces a number of first-moment relationships which will obtain in the steady-state. In addition, the special case of a Cobb-Douglas production function with a constant savings function is examined in detail and the steady-state distributions for",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a42_3ay_3a1975_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a375-393..htm,10.2307/2296851

The context of the discussion is very similar to that of an Arrow social welfare function, from which it differs in that the social preference pattern is not required to be an ordering but only to be free of cyclic preferences. Thus the inconsistency is the more impressive. Sen claims not to have imposed Arrow's condition of "" the independence of irrelevant alternatives "". This is undoubtedly true, in the sense that the condition contains a large number of assertions, of which only a few are invoked. I shall suggest, however, that the condition was used in a significant way, and that this is at the heart of the paradox. I then argue that the independence component of Sen's liberalism is unjustifiably strong in terms of its rationale, and I offer weaker versions, with discussions of their consistency or inconsistency with the Pareto principle. One of the results will show, incidentally, the critical need for an unrestricted domain. The main theme of this paper is the role of independence. This powerful condition, used fully or sparely, together with any non-trivial restriction on the social preference pattern, forces connections between different pairwise decisions. The technique was invented by Arrow [1]. These remarks do not detract from the interest of Sen's striking theorem, but they perhaps soften the suggested conflict between liberalism and the Pareto principle.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a42_3ay_3a1975_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a395-401..htm,10.2307/2296852

2438,Review of Economic Studies,Growth and Dualism in Less Developed Countries,['James McIntosh'],"1975, vol. 42, issue 3, 421-433",[],"The dual models of Lewis [15], Jorgenson [13] and Ranis and Fei [7] are an admirable contribution to the theory of economic development. Yet in none of these is the rate of population growth determined as an endogenous variable within the system3; nor is there an adequate explanation of intersectoral factor allocations. A new non-Malthusian population theory is proposed here. It is based on the hypothesis that changes in fertility rates are intimately connected with migration patterns. The exact formulation is simple and specific: the rate of population growth is determined by the distribution of the population between the two sectors. This formulation admits considerable generality; particularly it distinguishes reductions in the crude birth rate due to migration from those which are caused by declining age-specific fertility rates. In fact, at the two-sector level of aggregation this is about as general as one can get, especially since the population distribution is determined by relative prices. Further discussion of this may be found in Section 4. In the model developed in this paper individuals rationally decide in which sector they will be employed on the basis of comparative living standards and their locational and occupational preferences. Thus the allocations of goods and factors are determined by relative prices and total factor endowments. This general equilibrium approach has the advantage of not relying on such arbitrary assumptions as Lewis's "" unlimited supplies of labour"" or Jorgenson's condition of "" proportional wage rates "". On the other hand the added generality leads to technical difficulties. Unlike the Samuelson-Uzawa model, where factor prices determine commodity prices through a set of cost equations, both are determined simultaneously; the allocation of labour between sectors depends on one of the commodity's prices, in this case, food-the agricultural output, which means that the wage cannot be found independently of the price of food. Problems arise because uniqueness of momentary equilibrium is not a plausible assumption: neither diagonal dominance nor the Gale-Nikaido [10] conditions applied to the Jacobian have any intuitive appeal nor are the implied relationships among the elasticities likely to survive any sort of empirical test. Without uniqueness the system's motion must be described by a differential correspondence or a set valued differential equation.

Veendorp'],"1975, vol. 42, issue 3, 445-456",[],"In general equilibrium theory the Walrasian tatonnement process has traditionally been used to describe the behaviour of a system of competitive markets that are out of equilibrium. Recently, however, there have been a number of papers in which various aspects of disequilibrium situations are explored without reliance on this, admittedly convenient, abstraction. These studies indicate that its use tends to obscure most of the interesting implications of disequilibrium behaviour. The two simplifying assumptions upon which the tatonnement process is based, are the presence of auctioneers who adjust and announce market prices, and the possibility of recontract when markets do not clear. Dropping the first assumption creates room for price adjustments by individual sellers and buyers (see [1], [4], [5], [9], [26] and [27]). Elimination of the possibility to recontract forces one to accept trading at disequilibrium prices. Such "" false "" trading requires the formulation of trading rules, and affects the distribution of resources among individuals (see [10], [13], [14, pp. 128-29] and [20, pp. 659-65]). Since markets do not clear, trading at disequilibrium prices is also bound to frustrate some traders, who will thereby be induced to adjust their demand for and supply of other commodities (see [2], [3], [11], [17], [18] and [25]). In this paper we are interested mainly in this last aspect: the effects of non-realization of (positive or negative) excess demand on the market mechanism. The implicit frustrations have been formalized by Clower [3] in his dual decision hypothesis, and Patinkin's [21] term, "" spillover "", has been used to refer to their effects on excess market demands.3 The essence of the dual decision hypothesis is simply that the individual market demands may be functions of the realized transactions in other markets, and that, as a result, the relevant market signals are based on such revised or effective excess demands, instead of the notional excess demands of traditional theory. The question then arises of how the revision of demand signals will affect the stability of the Walrasian market mechanism. There seems to be a strong presumption that the system will be less stable than the traditional one. One finds repeated reference to the possible insufficiency of the effective market demands to induce the necessary price adjustments, to the deviation amplifying repercussions of such insufficiency, and to the possible emergence of chronically unemployed resources.4 The inevitability or even plausibility of these consequences is not directly obvious. If, for example, prices are such that notional excess supply prevails in the markets for both labour and final products, then the reduction in demand for final products by households, and for labour by firms, that results from the non-realization of desired supplies,",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a42_3ay_3a1975_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a445-456..htm,10.2307/2296857

He showed that this process has the following properties: (i) if the starting resource allocation is feasible, then all the ensuing resource allocations are also feasible; (ii) the process converges to a critical point, i.e. a point which satisfies the first-order conditions for the original planning problem; (iii) the value of the social welfare function increases monotonically during the whole process until an equilibrium point is reached; (iv) the process works even if increasing returns to scale exist.3 Heal's process is the only process within our,present knowledge that can cope with possible increasing returns to scale, and in that sense it constitutes a valuable addition to our common assets. But there remain some unresolved problems concerning this process. I. The system of differential equations defining Heal's process has rather complex discontinuities and it is not yet known whether it has a solution. II. An equilibrium point of this process is only known to be a critical point and may not give even a local maximum if increasing returns to scale exist.4 The purpose of the present paper is to consider these two problems. We will analyse the simplest version of Heal's process in which only one good is produced from one primary resource. The analysis and the results can be easily extended to more general versions in which multiple goods are produced from multiple primary resources and intermediate goods. In Section 2, below, we will give a brief sketch of the formal model. In Section 3 we will show that the system of differential equations defining Heal's process has at least one solution starting from any feasible initial allocation. In Section 4 we will relate the stability properties of the equilibrium points to their optimality properties in a manner analogous to the classical result of Lagrange and Dirichlet concerning conservative mechanical systems.5 In Section 5 we will consider the likelihood of convergence to a local sub-optimum point.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a42_3ay_3a1975_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a457-467..htm,10.2307/2296858

In this paper we formalize a similar process which focuses upon the coalition formation problems at the heart of all such trading processes. While our process is somewhat less descriptive of the role of the decision calculus of individuals in determining successive allocations than the bidding process of Hurwicz, Radner and Reiter [3], for example, we do admit such processes as special cases and our coalition formation framework appears to emphasize more naturally the problem of inter-agent communication.

The second scheme, in contrast, was equipped with S types of independent2 money claims and a set of C "" spot "" markets to be opened upon the occurrence of a particular state. Arrow then arrived at a remarkable conclusion (his Theorem 2) that the two schemes would lead to the same optimal allocation of risk-bearing. The "" social significance"" of the second scheme, he said, was that "" it permits economizing on markets; only S+ C markets are needed to achieve the optimal allocation, instead of the SC markets "".

Nagatani [1] will be useful in correcting a possible misunderstanding in reading my article on the allocation of risk-bearing [2]. I asserted (Section 3) that "" any optimal allocation of risk-bearing can be achieved by . . . a competitive system involving securities payable in money "" (emphasis added). The italicized word, "" can "" is somewhat ambiguous. As Nagatani notes, my construction requires each economic agent to be aware of what commodity prices, ps, will prevail for each possible state of nature. My construction, therefore, is a contingent-market version of the old idea of perfect foresight. With uncertainty present, it is not required that the future be known in order to achieve optimal allocation, only that commodity prices be known conditional on the state of nature; such knowledge is needed to give meaning to conditional contracts payable in money. Nagatani suggests that since the ex post commodity markets do not exist at the time of writing the contracts for money claims, no individual can in fact know what prices those markets will lead to. Hence, each individual will form a probability distribution for prices holding in each state of nature before trading in money claims, and the outcome will not be the same as it would be if contingent commodity contracts were traded directly. Let me suggest two interpretations which would justify my position. One is an equilibrium interpretation of ex post commodity prices. Clearly, if the correct ex post prices are believed in at the time the money claims markets are operating, they will in fact be achieved if the appropriate state of nature occurs; that is the way they are arrived at in my construction. This does not explain the process by which they are discovered on the market. One story which accomplishes this is to assume that the world consists of a succession of identical lotteries. In each, the allocation takes place in two stages, first a money claims market and then, when the state is revealed, a system of commodity markets. Which state actually occurs in each drawing is a random event with known probabilities. After a sufficiently long period, the commodity prices conditional on each possible state will become known, and the construction given by me will be the equilibrium outcome of this process (I have not investigated its stability). An alternative interpretation is that the definition of a state of the world includes a statement of the prices that will prevail. The money claims, then, are payable conditional on the occurrence of specified possible price vectors. In fact, many contracts in the real world which have some contingent features in them are payable in amounts which are functions of the ex post prices, the returns on common stocks for example. The second interpretation obviously eliminates a good many difficulties; there can be no uncertainty about the prices that will prevail in a given state if those prices are made part of the very definition of the state. But it must be admitted that there are some difficulties with this interpretation. Implicitly, at least, the uncertainties in the model are exogenous to the economic system; but prices are endogenous to it, and this might complicate our understanding of the model.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a42_3ay_3a1975_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a487-488..htm,10.2307/2296863

The purpose of this paper is to explore the implications of uncertainty in the production function for the validity of the HO theorem and its offspring, the factor-price equalization theorem. As a byproduct of our analysis, the Rybczynski theorem is also analysed. The HO theorem has been traditionally proved in terms of two alternative definitions of inter-country relative factor abundance, namely the "" factor-price "" definition and the "" physical "" definition. We show that the HO theorem cannot be proved in terms of the factor-price definition, but that the theorem is valid in terms of the physical definition even in the presence of uncertainty in the production process. The Rybczynski theorem also continues to hold, but the factor-price equalization theorem does not, even if all the assumptions made customarily for the validity of the theorem are satisfied.

Capital accumulation could only be a temporary phenomenon, accompanied by a falling rate of profit, until ultimately the rent of scarce natural resources would swallow up the whole of national income above a bare subsistence wage. Essentially similar views have been revived recently with the emphasis on physical constraints, rather than their expression in prices as rent, and with the semantic alteration of substituting ""environment"" for "" land "". The principal counter-argument, then as now, to this gloomy perspective, is that technical progress can stave off diminishing returns to permit continued growth. Since modern, formal growth theory has been so concerned with states of steady growth, the obvious question is whether steady growth is compatible with the existence of a fixed supply of economically scarce land. We do not, of course, expect growth in the real world to conform to the rigid requirements of steady growth as defined for model-building purposes, but an answer to this question would at least be a start. We shall see below that exogenous technical progress will not fit the bill, except by coincidence, so we turn to the theories of induced bias in technical progress put forward by Kennedy [1] and developed by Samuelson [2], Drandakis and Phelps [3] and others which have been used to provide a mechanism which leads technical progress to Harrod neutrality in the two factor case.

Recently, a problem of achieving designated target values in dynamic context has been analysed by Preston as a dynamic generalization of Tinbergen's conditions. He pointed out among other things, using the controllability condition of dynamic systems, that the number of instruments could be less than the number of target variables in achieving target variables at a point in time [4]. In practice, policy makers would be interested in not only achieving desired target values but also keeping them on some desired time trajectories once achieved.3 For example, they would be interested not only in achieving a certain inflation rate or level of foreign reserves but also in keeping them at some designated levels or changing them with time in some prescribed manner. This type of target variable manipulation requires more than the condition that dynamic systems are controllable. Since it is important that instruments have this added capability and since this aspect has not been covered in [4], it is the purpose of this note to describe the conditions for policy makers to be able to make the target variables follow desired time trajectories (including stationary values). This turns out to contain the original Tinbergen condition. Thus it may be considered to be a more proper dynamic generalization of Tinbergen's theory of policy. We consider economic models described by differential equations and give conditions for constant (time-invariant) linear economic models in Section 2.4 Under suitable conditions the local behaviour of non-linear economic models can be deduced from the corresponding linear ones.

Third, Theorem 3 and Corollary 3.1 show that homotheticity of the specific aggregator functions is a necessary condition for weak, and hence strong, separability together with equality restrictions on the partial elasticities of substitution.

Pattanaik'],"1975, vol. 42, issue 1, 93-103",[],"The problem of strategic or non-sincere voting has received considerable attention in recent contributions by Murakami [9, pp. 74-81], Farquharson [5], Sen [14, pp. 193-194], Gibbard [6], and Pattanaik [12, 13].3 Of these, Farquharson [5] and Gibbard [6] have discussed the problem with reference to decision procedures which always yield one and exactly one outcome. On the other hand Murakami [9], Sen [14], and Pattanaik [12, 13] have posed the problem within the Arrowian framework of "" group decision rules"" 4 which may yield several outcomes (the final choice from these outcomes being made presumably by some random mechanism) or none at all.5 The present paper also discusses the problem within this framework. The general conclusion which emerges from [9], [14], and [12, 13] seems to be that very few democratic group decision rules can ensure that strategic misrepresentation of preferences will never be resorted to by some coalition of individuals. In particular, Pattanaik [12] has shown that under most binary 6 and democratic group decision rules satisfying the Strict Pareto Criterion, a situation can arise where some coalition of individuals resort to non-sincere voting thereby benefiting all the members of the coalition.7 The main purpose of this paper is to extend this negative result by proving the much stronger result that most binary and democratic group decision rules satisfying the Strict Pareto Criterion leave scope for strategic manipulation in voting by single individuals without entering into any collusion with other individuals. The generalization is significant. For, as has been pointed out in the literature on game theory, costs and difficulties of communication, social sanction against certain alliances and other such factors may make certain coalitions infeasible in practice.8 However, none of these factors raises any problem so far as trivial coalitions of single individuals are concerned. From this point of view, our generalization of the result in [12] seems to be of considerable interest.

Theorems have been proved for a large number of cases involving utility functions with various special functional forms.3 There are no papers in the literature which prove theorems which hold for the class of all continuous, increasing, strictly quasi-concave utility of consumption and leisure functions.4 This is in marked contrast to the situation in the theory of consumer demand under certainty where the general case,5 as well as various special cases,6 has received considerable attention. The paucity of theorems which hold for the general case is somewhat surprising since strict quasi-concavity of utility functions has a particularly appealing interpretation in models which admit uncertain outcomes. This interpretation is that of the weakest form of risk-aversion [5, p. 101]. The present paper is concerned with the implications of the strict quasi-concavity hypothesis for the consumer's choice of savings rate and portfolio composition.7 The only results in the uncertainty literature which do not require hypotheses about the form of a consumer's utility function 8 which are stronger than strict quasi-concavity are general equilibrium theorems, such as those of Arrow and Debreu.9 The authors who use the Arrow-Debreu contingent commodity approach in the analysis of a consumer's",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a42_3ay_3a1975_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a105-116..htm,10.2307/2296824

Schwartz']","1975, vol. 42, issue 1, 125-131",[],"The study of oligopoly has progressed along two lines. The first deals with the behaviour of a firm viewing existing rivals as responsive to its actions. The critical assumption in this analysis is the firm's conjecture about rivals' reactions to its price or quantity decisions. Cournot [4] provided the classic supposition that rivals will maintain their current level of output in response to a change in the given firm's output level. This implies price matching by rivals. Questions addressed include those of existence and stability of equilibrium in an oligopolistic market, its possible convergence to the competitive solution as the number of firms increases indefinitely, and whether the approach is monotone (quasi-competitiveness). A recent synthesis is provided by Ruffin [11]. The second strand of inquiry focuses on the firm's behaviour regarding potential rivals, especially actions designed to preserve positive profits. The strategy of pricing to retard or preclude entry, "" limit pricing "", has received the most intense study. A summary of earlier theoretical developments is provided by Bhagwati [2]; more recent contributions include Gaskins [6], Pyatt [10], Baron [1], and Kamien and Schwartz [8, 9]. The first of these two lines of inquiry, focused on interaction among existing rivals, may be viewed as a short-run theory of oligopoly. The second approach, with its attention to consequences of potential rivalry, forms the complementary long-run theory. This paper constitutes an attempt to bridge these parallel developments, an objective shared with Fisher [5]. In the next section we present a model of a firm thatviews its existingrivals in accordance with the classic Cournot assumption and views potential rivals in the manner posited in our paper [8]. The timing of rival entry is regarded as a random variable whose probability distribution is dependent on current industry price. After obtaining necessary conditions for maximization of the firm's long-run expected profits, we extend the first four theorems of Ruffin's paper to the case in which potential rivalry is recognized. The classic Cournot oligopoly model is compared with the present one and our results are summarized. 2.

2476,Review of Economic Studies,Intergenerational Equity and Exhaustible Resources,['Robert Solow'],"1974, vol. 41, issue 5, 29-45",[],"The theory of optimal economic growth, in the form given it by Frank Ramsey and developed by many others, is thoroughly utilitarian in conception. It is utilitarian in the broad sense that social states are valued as a function of the utilities of individuals (individual moments of time, in this case, since individual persons are usually taken as identical and identically treated) with the possibility that a loss of utility to one individual (or generation) can be more than offset by an increment to another. It is also utilitarian in the narrow sense that social welfare is (usually 3) defined as the sum of the utilities of different individuals or generations. Recently the whole utilitarian approach to social choice has come under fundamental attack by John Rawls [9]. One particular view advanced by Rawls concerns me here. He argues, in effect, that inequality in the distribution of wealth or utility is justified only if it is a necessary condition for improvement in the position of the poorest individual or individuals. In other words, if social welfare, W, is to be written as a function of individual utilities U1, ..., U,, then Rawls argues for the particular function W = min (U1, ..., Un), so that maximizing social welfare amounts to maximizing the smallest Ui.4 This welfare function is sensitive only to gains and losses of utility by the poorest person. A Theory of Justice contains a section 5 explicitly devoted to equity between generations, i.e. the question that arises in the theory of optimal capital accumulation. Remarkably, the one thing this chapter does not do is to advocate unequivocally the max-min criterion espoused elsewhere in the book. In this context Rawls settles for such ambivalent statements as the following: "" . . . the question of justice between generations.. . subjects any ethical theory to severe if not impossible tests.... I believe that it is not possible, at present anyway, to define precise limits on what the rate of savings should be. How the burden of capital accumulation and of raising the standard of civilization is to be shared between generations seems to admit of no definite answer. It does not follow, however, that certain bounds which impose significant ethical constraints cannot be formulated.... Thus it seems evident, for example, that the classical principle of utility leads in the wrong direction for questions of justice between generations. . . . Thus the utilitarian doctrine may direct us to demand heavy sacrifices of the poorer generations for the sake of greater advantages for later ones that are far better off. But this calculus of advantages which balances the",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a41_3ay_3a1974_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a29-45..htm,10.2307/2296370
2477,Review of Economic Studies,Waiting for the Breeder,['Alan Manne'],"1974, vol. 41, issue 5, 47-65",[],"This paper is addressed to the selection of an optimal mix of electricity generating plants. The focus is on the problem of uncertainty with respect to the date of availability of breeder nuclear reactors. Sequential probabilistic linear programming is employed. This makes it possible to optimize the mix of fossil, nuclear, and peaking plants to be installed during the 1980's -- assuming that breeder technology will become available at some randomly determined later date. The model allows for the effects of exhausting our reserves of uranium ore. The exhaustion of these resources does not lead to disaster in the 21st century for an economy or a world with a backstop technology such as coal-fired electricity plants. 

There seems to be a low value of information on the breeder availability date, for the initial policy is rather insensitive to this date. This conclusion holds not only when future demands are taken as fixed parameters, but also when they are dependent upon the price of electricity. 

On environmental grounds (climate changes radioactivity hazards, air and water pollution), there may be good reasons to slow the rate of growth of electricity demand. These are quite different issues than exhausting the resources of low-cost uranium ore. If our numerical assumptions are correct, it is not optimal to slow down the electricity growth rate up to 1990 just because of possible delays in the arrival of the breeder and hence a rapid rise in the price of uranium. For the year 2000, the decision on demands can be deferred until the time arrives to make capital investment decisions for the decade following 1990. By that point, some of the breeder's uncertainties will have been resolved.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a41_3ay_3a1974_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a47-65..htm,10.2307/2296371
2478,Review of Economic Studies,Use Patterns for Depletable and Recycleable Resources,"['Milton C. Weinstein', 'Richard Zeckhauser']","1974, vol. 41, issue 5, 67-88",[],"Much policy interest in the environment these days is focused on the attractiveness of recycling and reusing natural resources that are in fixed supply. Commoner [3] and others have elicited this interest by their discussion of the earth as an ecologically "" closed"" system. Much of this interest has been generated by the increasing economic and environmental costs of solid waste disposal, and the ever-sharpening awareness of those costs. The applause for municipal and civic recycling has surely stemmed primarily from their contributions to environmental preservation.3 The major long-term contribution of recycling may lie, however, in a related but different arena. It can increase the effective long-term supplies of the resources that are being reused. In this context there is no need for public action. When recycleable resources are able to secure the appropriate rentals, private enterprises can be counted upon to conduct the required reclamation processes. The evident expansion of such private efforts suggests that for many resources the appropriate rentals are presently upon us. Market forces can be counted upon to bring about some recycling. Can they be relied upon to bring about the optimal amount? This paper addresses that question with the use of a simplified multi-stage model of resources in limited supply. The solid-waste problem, with its associated external diseconomies, is not considered.4 The goods that best illustrate our model under present economic conditions are iron, aluminium and a variety of heavy metals. For an explanation of the burgeoning interest in recycling these materials, we look to the supply and demand for these fixed-supply natural resources. In the predecessor paper to this work [14] the analysis was directed to natural resources in fixed supply that are depletable in the strict sense. Oil, coal and natural gas well fit that model. For them, reuse or regeneration are ruled out. The major result of our strictly depletable resource model was that the resource's price, assuming a perfect competitive commodity and capital market, would reflect marginal social cost in terms of discounted consumer-plus-producer surplus.5 The optimal (and under these conditions,",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a41_3ay_3a1974_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a67-88..htm,10.2307/2296372

The natural resource that was the centre of the discussion in Malthus' day was land; more recently, some concern has been expressed over the limitations imposed by the supplies of oil, or more generally, energy sources, of phosphorus, and of other materials required for production. Those who predicted imminent doom in the nineteenth century were obviously wrong. Were they simply wrong about the immediacy of catastrophe, or did they leave out something fundamental from their calculations? There are at least three economic forces offsetting the limitations imposed by natural resources: technical change, the substitution of man-made factors of production (capital) for natural resources, and returns to scale. This study is an attempt to determine more precisely under what conditions a sustainable level of per capita consumption is feasible, to characterize steady state paths in economies with natural resources, and to describe the optimal growth path of the economy, in particular to derive the optimal rate of extraction and the optimal savings rate in the presence of exhaustible natural resouces. One of the interesting problems posed by the presence of exhaustible natural resources is that some of the basic concepts of growth theory, such as "" steady state "" and "" natural rate of growth "", need to be re-examined. If, for instance, there are two unproduced factors, labour and natural resources, one of which is growing exponentially, the other of which is not growing at all, what is the "" natural rate of growth ""? In conventional economic discussions, the long-run growth rate of the economy is determined simply by the natural rate of growth and is independent of the savings rate. We shall show that in economies with natural resources, efficient growth paths which differ with respect to savings rate also differ, even asymptotically, with respect to the rate of growth. The analysis of optimal growth paths presents certain technical difficulties, because there are two state variables (the stock of capital per man and the stock of natural resources per man) and two control variables (the rate of extraction of natural resources and the savings rate). Fortunately, by the appropriate choice of variables, the qualitative properties of the path can be completely described. Optimal growth paths for economies with only capital or with just natural resources have been examined elsewhere. Typically, a country begins with little capital and hence, in the former models, optimal growth is characterized by increasing consumption per capita. On the other hand, natural resources act much like a capital good; since the stock",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a41_3ay_3a1974_3ai_3a5_3ap_3a123-137..htm,10.2307/2296377

The rules are social in that they produce a social output for any configuration of individual preference orderings. They are positional in that the output produced depends only upon the positions occupied by each alternative in the individual preference orderings.3 Social rules may be distinguished by the form of their output, be it a quasi-ordering, choice structure or complete ordering. For each form of output, we shall determine the class of social rules that satisfy certain desirable conditions. Part one deals with quasiordering rules; part two will deal with the other types of rules. Indeed, this part shows that certain desirable conditions are uniquely satisfied by the so-called positional rule. One alternative is as good as another by this rule if any individual's ranking of the second alternative can be matched by as high a ranking of the first alternative by some possibly different individual. The individuals' rankings should be as good for the one alternative as for the other. We characterize this rule in two ways. First, we show that it is the strongest rule to be included in certain ordering rules, the finite ranking ones. Thus it is equivalent to adopting the utilitarian formula under the assumption that individual utility functions are identical but unknown. Second, we show that the positional rule is the weakest to satisfy four conditions. The first of these, Symmetry, requires that if a relabelling of individuals and alternatives reproduces the original configuration of preference orderings then any alternative is socially indifferent to the one that receives its name. The second condition, Elimination, requires that if one alternative is socially as good as another it should remain so upon eliminating a group of individuals for which the two alternatives are socially indifferent. The third condition is the familiar one of Monotonicity or Positive Responsiveness and the fourth is concerned with the dissolution of individual indifferences. All of these conditions are very weak and compelling. Also, only the first requires that a social decision be made. The others are hypothetical and require that one social decision be made if another is. Thus it is remarkable that the conditions together are so productive and result in a rule at least as strong as the positional rule. This paper contains certain novelties that are worth emphasizing.

2487,Review of Economic Studies,Prices vs. Quantities,['Martin Weitzman'],"1974, vol. 41, issue 4, 477-491",[],"The setting for the problem under consideration is a large economic organization or system which in some cases is best thought of as the entire economy. Within this large economic organization resources are allocated by some combination of commands and prices (the exact mixture is inessential) or even by some other unspecified mechanism. The following question arises. For one particular isolated economic variable that needs to be regulated,3 what is the best way to implement control for the benefit of the organization as a whole? Is it better to directly administer the activity under scrutiny or to fix transfer prices and rely on self-interested profit or utility maximization to achieve the same ends in decentralized fashion? This issue is taken as the prototype problem of central control which is studied in the present paper. There are a great many specific examples which fit nicely into such a framework. One of current interest is the question of whether it would be better to control certain forms of pollution by setting emission standards or by charging the appropriate pollution taxes. When quantities are employed as planning instruments, the basic operating rules from the centre take the form of quotas, targets, or commands to produce a certain level of output. With prices as instruments, the rules specify either explicitly or implicitly that profits are to be maximized at the given parametric prices. Now a basic theme of resource allocation theory emphasizes the close connection between these two modes of control. No matter how one type of planning instrument is fixed, there is always a corresponding way to set the other which achieves the same result when implemented.4 From a strictly theoretical point of view there is really nothing to recommend one mode of control over the other. This notwithstanding, I think it is a fair generalization to say that the average economist in the Western marginalist tradition has at least a vague preference toward indirect control by prices, just as the typical non-economist leans toward the direct regulation of quantities. That a person not versed in economics should think primarily in terms of direct controls is probably due to the fact that he does not comprehend the full subtlety and strength of the invisible hand argument. The economist's attitude is somewhat more puzzling. Understanding that prices can be used as a powerful and flexible instrument for rationally allocating resources and that in fact a market economy automatically regulates itself in this manner is very different from being under the impression that such indirect controls are generally preferable for the kind of problem considered in this paper. Certainly a careful reading of economic theory yields little to support such a universal proposition.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a41_3ay_3a1974_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a477-491..htm,10.2307/2296698

2489,Review of Economic Studies,Incidence of a Capital Income Tax in a Growing Economy with Variable Savings Rates,['Martin Feldstein'],"1974, vol. 41, issue 4, 505-513",[],"The theory of economic growth has emphasized that the capital stock, unlike the labour force, is not an "" original "" factor of production but represents the accumulation of past incomes.2 Any analysis of the incidence of a tax on capital income should therefore begin by considering how the tax affects the stock of capital. Although a comparative static analysis with a varying capital stock can be instructive, the process of capital accumulation is represented best by a model of economic growth. The purpose of this paper is to examine how savings behaviour affects the long-run incidence of a tax on profits 3 in a growing economy. The analysis is in terms of a general tax on all capital income but the results are obviously relevant to understanding the incidence of the corporate income tax. With a fixed capital stock, owners of capital would bear the entire burden of a general tax on profits 4 and would avoid some of the burden of a partial tax on capital (such as the corporate income tax) to the extent that capital can shift away from the taxed sector to the untaxed sector without significantly reducing the marginal product of capital in the untaxed sector. Harberger's [4] analysis of such a model has shown that, with reasonable parameter values, the US corporate income tax is borne almost entirely by capital and is therefore quite similar in incidence to a general tax on capital income with a fixed capital stock. The current paper shows that replacing the usual static model and fixed capital stock by a model of a growing economy with variable savings rates substantially alters the conclusions about the incidence of a general tax on profits. For a wide range of plausible parameter values, a substantial fraction of the burden of a general profits tax is borne by labour. The assumption of a fixed capital stock may, therefore, also yield quite misleading conclusions in the analysis of the corporate income tax.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a41_3ay_3a1974_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a505-513..htm,10.2307/2296700

Accordingly there has been a proliferation of theories of inflation. This paper is concerned with the extent to which empirical support for just one of these theories, the so-called "" key-industry"" hypothesis, may be found in the characteristics of money-wage inflation in fifteen industrial countries, in all of which the structural relationships underlying the determination of money wages were oligopolistic product markets, strong trade unions and reasonable aggregate stability near full employment. The forces which cause inflation may be divided into two groups. In the first group may be placed those factors called, for the purposes of this paper, "" special effects "", which occur relatively infrequently, and, in general, have a once-and-for-all effect (although that effect may reverberate for some time). Examples are a devaluation, which by raising the prices of imported goods leads to upward pressure on money wages as unions seek to restore the real wages of their members; severe social conflict such as that in France in May 1968; and significant changes in the degree of state intervention in the wage-bargaining process. In the second category belong those forces which are believed to exert a systematic influence on the course of money wages, linking the rate of money wage inflation to the behaviour of particular economic, social or political variables. Empirical analyses designed to detect forces of the second type have typically concentrated on examination of the explanatory power of various aggregate statistics with respect to the rate of change of the average level of money wages (or in studies of price inflation, the average price level). Such investigations assume a considerable degree of behavioural uniformity across the diverse sectors of the economy. But the results of crosssection studies designed to detect sectoral determinants of wage inflation have, in general, failed to find any systematic elements underlying wage inflation in individual industries.3 One consistent characteristic of money-wage changes by sector that has emerged, however, is a high degree of uniformity in the rates of increase of earnings across all sectors of the economy, particularly across aU sectors of manufacturing.4 This inter-sectoral homogeneity in the face of the heterogeneity of most other (apparently relevant) variables",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a41_3ay_3a1974_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a515-523..htm,10.2307/2296701

The principle behind this fact was elucidated some time ago by R. Eisner [3], and almost as explicitly by J. von Neumann ([14] p. 2, note (e)), but it has been unfortunately ignored in subsequent literature. This article endeavours to put matters straight with particular reference to steady-state and non-steady-state n-industry models employing square "" input-output"" matrices, n> 0. The matter at issue is this: providing an economy's history is entirely known, "" this year's "" 4 replacements of fixed capital may be listed by industry of origin, as a vector d, or by industry of origin and use, as a matrix D; also, since "" last year's "" capacity outputs of industries and extensions thereto are known, so are "" this year's "" capacity outputs, and the respective columns of D may be divided by them giving a matrix of ratios U of fixed-capital replacements by industry of origin divided by capacity output of industry of use. Moreover, if the economy has long grown, with capacity operation of its industries, at a common growth rate r, with unchanging technique, and continues to grow so, both the vector d and the matrix D will do likewise from "" this year "" to "" next year "" and so on; the matrix of ratios U will then be invariant. However, in general, previous growth may not have been steady growth, and in this case (as well as for steady growth) both d, D and U are always a function of everything that has happened previously up to and including "" last year "". Except for the case of prior and continuing (exponential) growth at the common rate r, one cannot dictate steady future growth of the elements of fixedcapital replacements in d and D, nor can one state accurately, using D (before solving for industries' outputs), the proper ratios of fixed-capital replacements to "" this year's "" industries' outputs. (The latter are not necessarily the capacity outputs obtained from "" last year's "" information; see Concluding Remarks below. If solved-for outputs q do equal capacity outputs q*, U is a correct matrix; otherwise it is arbitrary and both q, and d and D (obtained from U and q) are incorrect). Stone and Brown, in [13], want to solve the problem of the conditions for sustained growth; commodities given in final consumption are to grow at their own specific rates, or at a common rate, for "" this [outputs' solution] year "" and all future years.

Klevorick']","1974, vol. 41, issue 4, 539-547",[],"Many political and social choice processes, particularly those based on some form of voting rule, can be usefully represented as simple games. A simple game differs from the usual variety of n-person game in that certain combinations or coalitions of voters are "" all-powerful "", and are able to enforce their will irrespective of the desires or actions of the players who are not members of the coalition, while all of the remaining coalitions are essentially powerless to affect the outcome. A familiar example is a majority game, in which any coalition containing a majority of players can secure any outcome its members are able to agree upon, while no minority coalition can influence the outcome if the opposing majority is agreed upon a course of action. Other examples of simple games, some very complicated, are cited in [8] and [9, Chapter 10]. While simple games clearly represent a rather special form of the more general n-person game, they may nevertheless be quite complex in structure and difficult to analyse. Moreover, the existence of a co-operative solution, such as the core, is by no means assured in games of this type. Many simple games are known for which no core exists; the famous "" voters' paradox "" is a particularly elementary three-player example of such a game. Indeed, much of the social choice and voting theory literature, though not cast in an explicitly game-theoretic framework, can be interpreted as showing how difficult it is to ensure the existence of a co-operative equilibrium in multi-person situations based on any reasonable kind of voting process or social choice mechanism. A particular equilibrium condition for majority rule known as "" single peakedness"" has played an important role in the voting theory literature. This condition was shown by Duncan Black to be sufficient to ensure existence of a majority winner, which is essentially equivalent to the existence of a core in a majority game. In fact, the condition is even more powerful than this, for it can also be shown to be sufficient for the existence of a core in any simple game (Theorem 2 of the present paper). Roughly speaking, singlepeakedness is equivalent to requiring that the relevant set of alternatives or possible outcomes be one-dimensional, and that voter preferences over this set be representable by strictly quasi-concave utility functions. While the condition is clearly restrictive, it is none the less a useful one, for in mBny economic problems it often arises as a natural consequence of the convexity of individual preferences. The usual examples of voting on resource-allocation or other public sector problems [3], [6, Chapter 6] are of this type. There have, however, also arisen examples of voting problems which, though essentially one-dimensional in character, are nevertheless such that the single-peakedness condition",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a41_3ay_3a1974_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a539-547..htm,10.2307/2296704

2495,Review of Economic Studies,A Note on Car Replacement,['Ronald Smith'],"1974, vol. 41, issue 4, 567-570",[],"Most studies of the demand for cars are designed to explain new purchases and assume that purchases are divided into net investment and replacement. Replacement is invariably identified with stock depletion, defined either as scrapping (determined by the length of life of a car) or as depreciation (determined by the decline in the price of a used car with age). Implicit in these theories is the assumption that the elasticity of substitution between the new and used car markets is rather high. This assumption is necessary to ensure that the price mechanism will induce consumers to buy new cars to make good the stock depleted by the scrapping or depreciation of used cars. Most empirical evidence indicates that this assumption is not justified and that new and used cars are poor substitutes, e.g. [1], [8] and [6]. Since the low degree of substitution between the two markets insulates new car purchases from the factors that influence the stock of used cars, stock depletion cannot explain replacement purchases of new cars. In this note an alternative approach will be suggested and its use illustrated by the case of new car sales in the US. The advantages of this approach are: (1) replacement is directly observable; (2) the assumption of perfect substitution between new and used car services is not necessary; and (3) it may help account for a series of implausible estimates of the depreciation rate that have been obtained from more orthodox models. It is generally accepted in the US automobile industry that new and used cars are bought by distinct groups. For instance, White in a recent study of the industry [6] says: New cars are not bought by a random selection of car owners but, instead, tend to be bought by a small group who buy new cars comparatively frequently and sell their used cars to the general public to hold. As an approximation, therefore, we can split buyers into two groups, those who buy their car new and those who buy it used, treating these groups as distinct. The demand of the new car buying group is primarily for replacement, since between 80 and 90 per cent of them trade-in or sell an old car when buying a new one; the average time from purchase to resale is between two and three years. This leads us to a definition of replacement as the process by which a consumer disposes of a car bought i years ago and purchases a new one. The existence of a well-developed second-hand market confirms that the replacement interval, i, is considerably shorter than the lifetime of a car, so that replacement does not equal scrapping. This replacement interval will vary between household and we shall observe a distribution of intervals, say c(i), which will determine the lag distribution generating replacement, U, from past purchases, Q; i.e.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a41_3ay_3a1974_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a567-570..htm,10.2307/2296706

This assumption has also been made in the models of Yaari [9], Meade [5] and Atkinson [1] that include the bequest motive upon which our analysis is based.3 One of the important implications of these analyses, though unnoted, is that under the assumption of a perfect capital market the optimal programme is neutral with respect to the actual form in which inheritance is bequeathed. Namely, the same optimal programme can be followed no matter whether the bequest is given as a gift inter vivos or as a transfer at death if one adjusts the amount of borrowing and lending suitably in the capital market. When there is imperfection in the capital market, this neutrality property is no longer expected to be true. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of imperfection in the capital market on the welfare of individuals, to examine whether or not we can give any prediction with regard to the types of inheritance arrangements that may appear and, finally, to examine some of the welfare implications of inheritance taxation, under the assumption of a certain representative type of capital market imperfection. Our analysis proceeds as follows. The first two sections evaluate the effects of imperfection in the capital market on the optimum path of consumption and the optimum amount of bequests under alternative inheritance schemes. The third section uses the results of the preceding sections to discuss the patterns of choice of inheritance arrangement and also examines some qualitative effects of inheritance taxation.

2508,Review of Economic Studies,A Difficulty in the Concept of Fairness,"['Elisha A. Pazner', 'David Schmeidler']","1974, vol. 41, issue 3, 441-443",[],"This note raises a new difficulty concerning the possibility of satisfying equity and Pareto efficiency objectives simultaneously. When interpersonal comparisons of utility are ruled out, which is the case considered here, there is no natural way to define the concept of equity. An appropriate criterion for equity discussed in the literature seems to be that of fairness. An allocation is said to be fair (equitable) if no individual in the society prefers the bundle allocated to anyone else over the bundle allocated to him (Dubins and Spanier [2], Foley [3] and Sen [5]). We present here two examples of economies in which no Pareto optimal allocation is fair, even in the absence of externalities, non convexities or other deviations from the classical Arrow-Debreu environment. In the first example there are two consumers, one consumption good and two kinds of labour (one for each consumer). The production possibilities of the economy are characterized by the constant returns to scale technology set {(x, y, z) E R3 I x ul(x,, 0, z1) for x1 >0 and (0, 0, z1 +x1), (0, Y2, z2) is also feasible. Similarly, Y2 0 is incompatible with Pareto optimality because u2(0, Y2+s, Z2-8/10)>U2(0, Y2, Z2) for any 0 u2(0, Y2, 0) as z1 > 1 _ Y2. We are left with the case of Y2 = 1 where any Pareto optimal allocation is of the form (0, 0, z1), (0, 1, z2) and Z +Z2 = 1. Noting that the definition of fairness means that each consumer evaluates the bundles of other consumers from his own point of view, the first individual will look at the bundle (0, 1, Z2) of the second as involving the consumption of one unit of leisure and Z2 units of the consumption good (i.e. as though it were (1, 0, Z2)). Therefore, in order for the allocations under consideration to be fair from the point of view of the first individual, it must be true that 1 Iz1/l0 ? 1 + 1 lz2/10. Similarly, fairness from the point of view of the second individual requires 1+ 2z2 > 2z1. These two inequalities are incompatible (as they imply 1/2+ z2 > z1 ? 10/Il +Z2). This completes our first counterexample. In our second example, in order to illustrate that the result does not depend on permuting commodities when applying the fairness criterion, utility is assumed to depend only on consumption goods. Leisure as such does not yield direct utility but as the consumption (as well as the production) process is time-consuming, leisure time is a necessary input to the welfare of consumers. There are now five commodities: time, two types of labour services and two different consumption goods.

For any feasible plan the production function gives the maximum net output of any commodity as a function of the net outputs of all other commodities. The profit function gives the maximum value of profit for any feasible production plan as a function of the prices of all commodities. The theory of marginal productivity provides a characterization of the set of production possibilities from the technological point of view. Our first objective is to present a modern approach to the theory of marginal productivity, employing the production function and the marginal productivity correspondence. The marginal productivity correspondence may be identified with the gradient of the production function, wherever the gradient exists. Otherwise, the marginal productivity correspondence takes a set of possible values rather than a single value. Our second objective is to present equivalent specifications of the set of production possibilities, the production function and the marginal productivity correspondence. We take a characterization of any one of the three as a starting-point of the theory of production and derive properties of the other two. We characterize the production function in terms of the properties of the marginal productivity correspondence. We also derive properties of the set of production possibilities from properties of the production function, reversing the line of reasoning that has become conventional in the theory of production. Our third objective is to characterize the set of feasible production plans from the point of view of economic behaviour. For this purpose we present a theory of supply that parallels the theory of marginal productivity. We develop equivalent specifications of the profit function, the supply correspondence, and the set of price and profit possibilities. Any one of the three can be taken as a starting point for the theory of supply. Our final objective is to link the theory of supply with the theory of marginal productivity and to demonstrate the equivalence of the technological and behavioural view-",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a41_3ay_3a1974_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a181-200..htm,10.2307/2296712
2512,Review of Economic Studies,Technological and Price Uncertainty in a Ricardian Model of International Trade,['Stephen J Turnovsky'],"1974, vol. 41, issue 2, 201-217",[],"Despite the fact that international trade is one of the riskiest economic activities, there has been remarkably little attempt to incorporate uncertainty into the formal theory. One of the few published papers dealing with this issue is the important contribution by Brainard and Cooper [3]. However, their formal analysis is rather restrictive in that they deal only with the quadratic utility function and focus primarily on the case where the country is required to make all its decisions-both production and consumption-before the uncertainties are resolved. The present paper introduces uncertainty into a Ricardian model of international trade. While this technology is somewhat more restrictive than the neoclassical production possibility frontier considered by Brainard and Cooper, it nevertheless is an interesting case to start with in view of the fundamental role the Ricardian case has played in the development of international trade theory. Furthermore, it is of considerable interest to determine to what extent the extreme implications regarding the patterns of specialization associated with the classical Ricardian model remain after the introduction of uncertainty. In other respects the present analysis is more general than the Brainard-Cooper model. In the first place we try as far as possible to derive propositions based on general utility functions, although where appropriate, we use special cases to illustrate particular propositions. In establishing these propositions a crucial role is played by the "" indirect utility function"" which enables us to analyse the behaviour most conveniently in terms of the familiar Arrow-Pratt measures of risk aversion. The model is developed for a small country, in which domestic technology and the international trading price (which it takes as given) are both subject to uncertainty. We develop a kind of two-stage analysis in which production decisions are made before the random technological parameters and the actual trading price are known, while trading and thus consumption decisions are made after the uncertainties are resolved. In view of the lags associated with production and the fact that most international trade takes place at previously established prices, this seems to be the most plausible case to consider. Brainard and Cooper did not consider it on the grounds of analytical intractability, but in fact the analysis is no more difficult than the case they examine where all decisions are made under uncertainty.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a41_3ay_3a1974_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a201-217..htm,10.2307/2296713

Even today, agriculture is taken as the paradigm-and perhaps almost the only important example-of a truly competitive market (or at least this was the case until the widespread government intervention in this market). For a number of years I have been concerned with how competitive markets handle risk taking, and how risk affects real resource allocation. Risks in agriculture are clearly tremendously important, yet remarkably the traditional theoretical literature has avoided explicit treatment 3 of risk sharing in agricultural environments. The consequences of this are important. First, it makes suspect the traditional conclusions regarding sharecropping. Is it really true that sharecropping results in too low a supply of labour, because workers equate their share of output times the (value of the) marginal productivity of labour to the marginal disutility of work, whereas Pareto optimality requires the (value of the) marginal productivity of labour be equal to the marginal disutility of work? Or is it true, as Wicksell asserted, that there is no distincion between landlords hiring labour or labour renting land? Second, it leaves unanswered many of the important economic questions. How is the equilibrium share determined? Why have some economies (in the past or at present) used one distribution system, other economies used others? Our object is to formulate a simple general equilibrium model of a competitive agricultural economy. (Other general equilibrium models of competitive economies with uncertainty have been formulated by Arrow [2] and Debreu [9], Diamond [10], and Stiglitz [14]. Each of these has its serious limitations in describing the workings of the modern capitalist economy. (See Stiglitz [15]).) The model is of interest not only for extending our understanding of these simple economies but also in gaining some insight into the far more complex phenomena of shareholding in modern corporations. Our focus is on the risk sharing and incentive properties of alternative distribution systems. The analysis is divided into two parts. In the first, the amount of labour (effort) supplied by an individual is given, and the analysis focuses on the risk sharing aspects of",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a41_3ay_3a1974_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a219-255..htm,10.2307/2296714

We investigate market equilibrium in such a situation, and we show that durability is not independent of market structure when the good is sold rather than rented. Consumers, who may be firms or households, are assumed not to value durability as such; they are only concerned with the available flow of services of the good. This flow is assumed proportional to the stock of the good, and, without loss of generality, we take the proportionality constant to be unity. When the good is sold, it is assumed that buyers in turn can buy, sell, or rent in perfect secondhand markets. Capital markets are also perfect, so that producers and their customers can borrow or lend unlimited amounts at the same (continuously compounded) rate of interest. Strictly constant returns to scale are posited, in that the marginal cost of producing a unit of the good depends only on its built-in durability and not on the rate of production.4 Customers are assumed to have perfect foresight.5 The good involved is assumed to deteriorate or decay exponentially. The new assumption is that the decay rate depends on the built-in decay rate, i.e. the durability the good is endowed with when it is manufactured, and on the level of maintenance spending per unit. Maintenance services are thus assumed to be in perfectly elastic supply. It is assumed that maintenance spending is always determined by the owner of the good, who is the manufacturer when the good is rented but the buyer when the good is sold. As these parties have different objectives, they may choose different maintenance policies. To the extent that they do this, the equilibrium values of the quantities under the manufacturer's control may depend on whether the good is rented or sold.

Neuefeind']","1974, vol. 41, issue 2, 289-291",[],"A problem of major concern to economists is that of knowing whether certain phenomena are "" likely "" or not. For example, the econometrician would doubtless be happy if it were true that Cobb-Douglas production functions are very "" likely "" in the sense that any production function could be closely approximated by a function of the Cobb-Douglas type. Such results would provide excellent protection against those critics who claim that such functions are only "" special cases "". The lack of these results is due largely to the idea of being "" likely "" having been used in too general and intuitive a way. In showing here that economies with a unique equilibrium are likely we will incidentally show that if being likely is interpreted carefully, within the context of a particular problem, then a surprising number of apparently improbable phenomena may in fact rigorously, be shown to be likely. We will now examine the fundamental problem of establishing whether uniqueness of equilibrium is "" likely "" (see Arrow and Hahn [1, Chap. 9]). The standard way to demonstrate the "" likeliness "" of some property is to show that it holds generically, i.e. on an open dense set with respect to some meaningful topology. We show that for a carefully chosen topology on the space of all economies, which we call the "" y topology "", just such a statement is true for the uniqueness of equilibrium.3 A suggestion that such a statement might be true can be inferred from Dierker's result [4] that the number of equilibrium prices is generically odd. He also gives an indication of the significance of establishing the uniqueness of equilibrium. Following Debreu [3] we define an economy with a commodity space R' as a tuple (f1, *--, fm1~l ..., COm). Here m denotes the number of consumers involved, fi (resp. woi E R') denotes the C' demand function 4 (resp. the strictly positive resources) of the ith consumer. An equilibrium for this economy is a tuple (p, x1, ..., x.) of prices p E R', zPh = 1, and commodity bundles xi e R' , such that lixi = Sioi and xi = fi(p, p cioi) for each consumer i. In the following all topological notions are with respect to the y topology. The definition of this topology, however, is somewhat technical, so it is relegated to the appendix, as one of the proofs of the theorems.

They concluded that the bias from neglecting substitution possibilities between produced and primary inputs is usually small. The purpose of this paper is to make three comments on their conclusions. Firstly, there is an error, or possibly a misprint, which can be misleading. Secondly, because Grubel and Lloyd restrict their calculations to a narrower range of parameter values than is empirically reasonable their results understate the magnitude of the bias which one might reasonably expect to encounter in empirically grounded calculations. Thirdly, Grubel and Lloyd conclude that "" the bias from neglecting substitution possibilities is usually small "" 3 without discussing criteria for determining when a bias becomes significant. It is shown here that the magnitude of the bias encountered when using empirically relevant data is very significant because the ranking of production processes by their calculated ERP can vary greatly with biased estimates.

The purpose of this paper is to give some theoretical justification to the above contention, and to study with some precision the role of expectations in determining the optimal investment programme of a firm. As Arrow [1] has made clear, the traditional neo-classical investment rule, where a perfectly competitive firm accumulates or decumulates capital to the point where its marginal product is equal to the real rate of interest, leaves no role for expectations and is essentially myopic. An important aspect of the world that is ignored in the formulation of the myopic rule is the fact that, once a firm has acquired capital stock and "" bolted down the machinery "", possibilities of subsequent decumulation are severely limited. One way of capturing this aspect in a model is to make investment an irreversible process and this was the approach that Arrow used in [1] in the context of a perfectly competitive firm. Once this assumption is made, then it is clear that the investment rule is no longer myopic and expectations matter. In this paper, the irreversibility assumption is used in the context of a firm which is not perfectly competitive, but instead faces a known downward sloping demand curve for its product. This demand curve is expected to vary over time, but the firm's expectations are held with certainty. The way in which the firm behaves over time is then as follows. At the present moment the firm formulates a production and investment plan based on its expectations, it follows this plan until such time as its expectations prove incorrect. It then reformulates its expectations, computes a new plan and proceeds as before. In order to bring out clearly the possibility of excess capacity, and further because the problems considered are fairly short run, the firm is assumed to have a fixed coefficients technology. Under these circumstances, it is possible without great loss of generality to assume there is only one other factor apart from capital, which will be termed "" labour "".3 In Section 2 of the paper the general problem is formulated and the solution presented. In Section 3, two specific problems are considered, one concerning the optimal investment plans of the firm over a demand cycle, the other concerning expectations of a change in the price of capital. In Section 4, the problem of how the desired investment rate of the firm over a demand cycle is affected by unexpected changes in demand conditions, cost conditions and in expectations themselves, is considered. This gives some idea of how the firm will react to changes in government policy, specifically monetary policy. One drawback of the above type of analysis is the fact that it may take time for a firm to adjust to its desired capital stock if this moves upward quickly and unexpectedly. Strictly speaking, therefore, adjustment costs should be incorporated into the optimal",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a41_3ay_3a1974_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a1-19..htm,10.2307/2296395
2521,Review of Economic Studies,Taxation and the Cost of Capital,['Mervyn A. King'],"1974, vol. 41, issue 1, 21-35",[],"The way in which taxation affects corporate financial policy, and the level of investment through the structure of the cost of capital, is still a bone of contention. Various specifications of the cost of capital have been used in econometric models (for example, Jorgenson [3]) although in a recent theoretical paper Stiglitz [10] has claimed that, ignoring uncertainty, the cost of capital is simply the rate of interest.3 In this paper we shall analyse the effect of personal and corporate taxation on both the firm's choice of financial policy and its investment decision. We shall see that the latter is influenced by the former because the cost of capital depends upon the optimal financial policy. The results have implications for the specification of the neoclassical investment model which has come to play such an important part in the econometric study of investment behaviour, because the cost of capital is a good deal more complicated than most of this work allows for. Another problem which will be examined is how expectations of future changes in tax rates affect the firm's policy. In recent years governments have often announced tax changes in advance, and increasing attention is being paid to the use of announcements of future tax changes as a policy tool in its own right. These announcement effects can have a significant impact on investment behaviour. To make it easier to see the role of taxation we shall assume a world of perfect certainty. There are three justifications for this neglect of uncertainty. First, when tax changes are announced in advance, expectations that these changes will take place are held with a very high degree of certainty. Secondly, this assumption makes our results directly comparable with those of the neoclassical investment model. Finally, in a world of certainty we know that the firm will, if it is acting in the shareholders' interests, maximize the market value of the stock. But in a world of uncertainty which does not have a complete set of Arrow-Debreu markets it is not clear just what the firm should be trying to maximize. This is because shareholders have different subjective beliefs about what the best policy is, and there are no contingent commodity markets for them to hedge on. If one shareholder believes that the firm would make enormous profits by drilling for oil in the North Sea and nobody else believes that this would be successful, then for this shareholder the optimal policy is to drill even though the market value of the firm's stock would slump in the short run.4 Section 2 discusses a model of the valuation of the company and the way in which this is influenced by taxation. This brings out the interaction between the systems of personal and corporate taxation. In Section 3 we analyse the firm's optimal financial policy where it has a choice between financing investment by using retentions, borrowing, or",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a41_3ay_3a1974_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a21-35..htm,10.2307/2296396
2522,Review of Economic Studies,Wages and Employment under Uncertain Demand,['Martin Neil Baily'],"1974, vol. 41, issue 1, 37-50",[],"This paper examines some implications of two postulates for firms' wage and employment policies. The first is that firms, or stockholders, have easier access to capital markets at lower costs or higher returns than do small investors, such as workers. Second, there are important mobility and turnover costs incurred when a worker moves from one firm to another. The existence of mobility costs means that the labour market is not a perfect market. Each firm is not restricted to taking as given some exogenous market wage, period by period, but has some amount of freedom about the wage strategy it sets. The firm cannot choose any wage-employment path it wishes, however, and I shall assume that in the long-run the firm must offer the same (expected) utility as that available elsewhere. In the short-run there is a constraint that the wage offer must never be so bad that all the firm's workers will quit and incur the mobility cost. There are solid grounds for believing that great differences exist between stockholders and workers with regard to capital markets. The majority of stocks are held by very wealthy persons indeed, who also hold almost all the state and local bonds and large proportions of the property and other assets.3 In addition, stockholders are frequently company executives or professionals with greater financial expertise and salaries many times that of the average industrial worker. The worker typically has a rather small net worth. His assets are durable goods and a rather small holding of money. He frequently has consumer credit liabilities outstanding.4 He also has much less knowledge of financial assets and institutions. A principal function of capital markets is to allow wealth-holders to diversify their holdings and so reduce the risk of their total portfolios. Stockholders, through their greater wealth and expertise, are much better able to bear risks than are workers.5 The difference in ability to bear risk between the two groups immediately suggests an opportunity to trade. In deciding what wage-employment strategy to set, the firm will be willing to reduce worker risk. By doing so, the firm is offering a joint product, employment plus an insurance or financial intermediation service. The firm does not do this simply because workers prefer it. Risk-reducing policies are the cheapest and hence most profitable way of attracting any given work-force. The choice of a risk-reducing policy by the firm will have an important impact on both the wage set and on employment variations-and hence the probability of unemployment. The firm will, in general, wish to reduce the uncertainty of the workers' incomes. An important feature of the model presented here is that the tendency of the firm to reduce risk has an asymmetrical effect on the wage strategy and on the employment strategy.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a41_3ay_3a1974_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a37-50..htm,10.2307/2296397

Suppressed inflation is the opposite of suppressed deflation, in which aggregate supplies of output and labour exceed aggregate demands. Both suppressed inflation and suppressed deflation involve non-wage and non-price rationing. In suppressed inflation, purchases of goods and labour services are rationed. In suppressed deflation, sales are rationed. Suppressed inflation and suppressed deflation both result from the inability of wages and prices to adjust instantaneously, in response to shifts in aggregate demand or supply, to satisfy the conditions for general market clearing. This inability can result either from effective legal constraints-that is, the imposition of price and wage ceilings or floorsor from natural frictions in the workings of the market mechanism.3 However, whatever the cause of wage and price stickiness, the resulting failure of markets to clear has profound consequences for the determination of output and employment. In the case of suppressed deflation, standard macro-economic analysis has long recognized these consequences. In contrast, suppressed inflation, although empirically not a rare phenomenon, has been the subject of little systematic theoretical analysis. In addition, the standard macro-economic paradigm fails even to recognize the analogybetween suppressed inflation and suppressed deflation. A central aspect of the received theory of suppressed deflation is the demand multiplier. This theoretical construct was first discovered by Kahn [7] and expanded by Keynes [8] and quickly became part of conventional wisdom. Assume, starting from a position of general market clearing and full employment, an autonomous reduction in aggregate demand for current output.4 Maintaining full employment would require a fall in the price level and nominal wage rate, but prices and wages are sticky. The initial effect of the reduced demand will be the emergence of excess supply in the output market. This excess supply induces the representative firm to reduce output to what it can sell, which is less than what it desires to sell at current wages and prices, and to reduce its effective",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a41_3ay_3a1974_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a87-104..htm,10.2307/2296401

The sole constraint is that production is in the aggregate production set. This optimum can be achieved as a competitive equilibrium with the government supplying the public good up to the point where I MRS = MRT and financing its production by lump-sum taxation. Lump-sum transfers may also be employed to achieve the appropriate income distribution.

Recent research by numerous individuals has indicated, however, that many of the implications of the Markowitz-Tobin theory can be derived from a weaker set of assumptions. The net result is a remarkably strong set of propositions and theorems with a wide variety of applications including intuitive insights into the gains from diversification, empirically useful algorithms for common stock selection, and theoretical advances for understanding the demand for money and the general equilibrium of financial markets. In this paper we discuss the application of these principles of portfolio selection to the behaviour of a depository financial intermediary. This notion is not, of course, entirely novel. For one thing, the extensions of the Markowitz-Tobin theory to include short sales (see Lintner [9]) and mutual fund behaviour (see Merton [12] and the cited studies) indicate that at a sufficiently high level of abstraction the available theory may be directly applicable to financial intermediaries. For another, empirical studies are now available that attempt to explain financial intermediary behaviour on the basis of the principles of portfolio theory (see Parkin [13]). In the case of the extended Markowitz-Tobin model, however, it is to be stressed that it may be applied to depository financial intermediaries only by abstracting from many of the institutional and market factors that make these intermediaries unique, and thus there does remain the need to develop a theory that explicitly incorporates these factors. With respect to the empirical studies, the primary objective has been the estimation of demand functions for financial assets, and thus there has been little attempt to derive the theoretical propositions that become available when portfolio theory is applied to financial intermediaries.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a41_3ay_3a1974_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a129-147..htm,10.2307/2296404

It was subsequently maintained that Kaldor's model is not, in fact, logically defective, but is based on the assumption that different savings propensities apply to distinct classes of income (profits and wages) rather than to distinct socio-economic classes (capitalists and workers).3 To examine the implications of this assumption, this note first generalizes both the Kaldor and Pasinetti models by allowing the workers' propensity to save out of profits, spw, to differ both from their propensity to save out of wages, sww, and from the capitalists' propensity to save out of profits, spc(spc > Spw). It goes on to show that, if Sww> 0, Kaldor's implicit assumption that spw = Spc has the paradoxical result of making impossible the long-run coexistence of capitalist and worker classes, the validity of which is crucial for his model. If KC and KW are the capital stocks belonging to capitalists and workers, steady growth at the rate n implies that nKc = SC",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a41_3ay_3a1974_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a149-150..htm,10.2307/2296405

Moreover, in a Debreu-economy households may always be interpreted as facing a "" present value "" budget constraint; in a sequence economy this is not always possible. Roughly speaking I shall be defining an inessential sequence economy as one in which the sequence makes no difference to what we have already deduced about the equilibrium of a Debreu-economy. I shall show that only such economies can be Pareto-efficient relative to a transactions technology and distribution of endowments amongst households. But there are also non-inessential sequence economies. This leads me to money and forward markets in money. I deal with the question: "" why do agents hold money?

I show that no sequence economy in equilibrium with borrowing and lending of money can be efficient if such borrowing and lending is costly; I shall comment on the robustness of these conclusions. It will become plain that since the classical dichotomy can only fail to hold for economies with sequences which are not inessential this dichotomy seems to imply that monetary equilibria of this kind are inefficient. I start with a recapitulation of an earlier paper from which this one takes its point of departure although before that I provide the notation to be used which I hope improves on the very bad one in [3].

This procedure enables a proof of the existence of such an equilibrium to be obtained. While no properties of efficiency are claimed for such an equilibrium, the procedure is of great potential use in the consideration of the efficiency losses and distributional impacts from alternative tax schemes. Application 4 of such a technique may be found in such areas as the tax reform programmes being discussed in the USA, Canada, the UK and other countries.5 We consider a general Walrasian model with an arbitrary set of ad valorem commodity taxes. The method of computing an equilibrium is based on Scarf's Algorithm [7, 8]. The tax rates need not be uniform across production sectors or individuals. The revenue generated from the tax system is dispersed among the individual consumers, each of whom is assigned an arbitrary share of the total, or retained by the government for the purchase of goods and services. The only restriction on revenue distribution schemes is that the shares (those of individuals and the government) sum to unity and that each recipient's allocation be a continuous function of total tax revenue. The major theorem of this paper is a substantial extension of the existence proof of a competitive equilibrium in the absence of taxes (see, for example, Arrow and Hahn [1], Scarf [7], McKenzie [6], or Debreu [2]) and is of particular importance if the general equilibrium framework is to be useful for the evaluation of economic policy regarding taxes and tariffs. Without such an existence proof, it is difficult to contemplate the computation of equilibria under various tax regimes. For convenience most of the exposition will be concerned only with an economy with differential producer taxes; the case of differential producer and consumer taxes is discussed in Section 4.

Marchand'],"1973, vol. 40, issue 4, 507-515",[],"Telephone companies are typical examples of firms that produce non-storable services the demand for which is randomly distributed over time. Unless telephone rates are allowed to respond instantaneously, demand occasionally exceeds the capacity of production and some calls, usually selected at random, are rejected or delayed.3 In addition to the stochastic nature of the demand for its services, the telephone industry has two other salient features that will be taken into account in this study. First, despite its stochastic components, the demand for telephone services can be shown to follow some predictable periodic patterns. Second, the telephone industry is generally required to cover its costs by its revenues. But, like most public utilities, it is deemed to exhibit increasing returns to scale.4 Accordingly, if a telephone utility priced its services at marginal cost, some deficit would presumably appear; in most countries, this is prevented by the current regulatory rules. The purpose of this paper is to derive second-best pricing and investment rules for a telephone utility whose demand shows both periodic and stochastic fluctuations and which is subject to a budgetary constraint.5 The notation and assumptions of the second-best model can be found in Section 2. This section also includes the first-order conditions that the telephone rates and the level of equipment must satisfy. Making use of the conditions to be satisfied in the case of profit maximization and in the first-best case where no budgetary constraint is imposed, interpretation is given in Section 3 to the second-best conditions for a telephone utility constrained to balance its budget. Implications of our results are drawn in Section 4. It is shown there how they can be used to determine the extent to which discrimination in telephone rates can be justified when the utility is required",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a40_3ay_3a1973_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a507-515..htm,10.2307/2296584

This may be interpreted as saying that in such an economy, if an allocation is on the contract curve, i.e. in the core, then individuals of the same type receive the same bundle of goods.

Sieper', 'Peter Swan']","1973, vol. 40, issue 3, 333-351",[],"While economic theory has concentrated considerable attention on the firm as a user and accumulator of capital, analysis of its role as a producer of durable capital goods appears to have suffered comparative neglect. In recent years, however, a number of papers, inspired by the model of durable goods production developed by Wicksell in the course of his classical treatment of Ackerman's problem [10], have helped redress the balance. Modern writers, such as D. D. Martin [5], E. Kleiman and T. Ophir in this journal [3], D. Levhari and T. N. Srinivasan [4] and R. L. Schmalensee [6], have elaborated upon Wicksell's analysis by treating alternative time profiles of product decay and by considering the case of monopoly as well as that of competition. However, they have all followed Wicksell in confining their attention to an assumed long-run equilibrium in which the durability of the product, the rate of production, and the flow of services provided by the entire stock of the product, are all constant over time. The convenience of this long-run equilibrium assumption lies in the simple relationship it ensures between the rate of production and aggregate product services on the one hand, and between the price of the product and the price of its services on the other. These relationships allow the familiar Marshallian analysis of price and output determination under competition to be readily extended to the market for a durable good, and appear to permit a similar straightforward extension in the case of monopoly. Such simplicity nevertheless has its price. An analysis confined to situations of longrun equilibrium sheds no light on the behaviour of the industry in the short run, nor indeed on the conditions under which long-run equilibrium will be attained as a consequence of profit maximization. More seriously, by restricting their attention to positions of long-run equilibrium, those authors referred to above, who have extended Wicksell's results to the monopoly case, have been led to disregard Jevon's maxim that "" in commerce, by-gones are for ever by-gones . . .""; an error which has produced the dramatic, but erroneous, conclusion that a monopolist will produce less durable assets than would perfect competitors operating under identical conditions of (constant) cost and demand. Thus one purpose of this paper is to analyse the production of durable goods, under the alternative regimes of competition and mol46poly, without imposing at the outset the assumption that the industry is in long-run equilibrium. Since the development of the industry over time depends critically on the relative importance of fixed costs, we treat the polar case, where all costs are escapable in the short run, in Part III, while fixed costs are introduced in Part V.

Grinold', 'Haim Levy']","1973, vol. 40, issue 3, 367-376",[],"The investment decision under capital rationing has been of intense interest to individuals in the field of finance. A major research problem in this area is the specification of a criterion function for solving the capital rationing problem. Lorie and Savage [8] and Weingartner [11] argued that when faced with capital rationing, the firm's objective should be the maximization of the present value of its investments' cash flows. What was troubling to some about this formulation is the assumption that the discount rate, necessary for the calculation of the present value of an investment's cash flows, is known before the problem of project selection is undertaken. Baumol and Quandt (B-Q) [1] confronted this problem directly. First, they reminded their readers that Hirschleifer [5] had shown that the appropriate discount rate in a pure capital rationing problem is given by the slope of the investment opportunity curve at its point of tangency with the investor's highest indifference curve, and this rate cannot be discovered until the utility function is specified fully and the final consumption vector determined. Hence, B-Q claim (as Hirschleifer does) that under capital rationing the discount rate cannot be an external variable but must be an internal variable, which, among other things, is a function of the available projects and the actual capital constraints.3 As a way to circumvent this problem, B-Q offer the individual's utility of consumption flows over time as a substitute objective function. However, in B-Q's formulation, one needs to specify fully the individual's utility function, a task which is difficult. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the efficient set of consumption vectors when the problem is the maximization of U(c1, c2, ..., cJ), where ci is consumption in period i, and U is some general utility function. We assume nothing about the specific form of the utility function. The only assumption we make is that more consumption is preferred to less.

Wykoff'],"1973, vol. 40, issue 3, 377-390",[],"Recent econometric investigation into corporate investment behaviour in the US has re-emphasized the importance of the user-cost element in investment decisions.3 But despite the obvious parallels between investment decisions by firms and durable purchase decisions by consumers, the user-cost theory has not been applied to consumer durable goods demand. This paper attempts to fill this hiatus. Both investment and durable goods studies usually start by assuming a very general "" stock adjustment"" or "" generalized accelerator "" framework.4 In the case of automobiles, new car purchases are acquisitions to the existing stock. The rate of acquisition depends upon the difference between the existing stock and some desired level. Most efforts in automobile demand studies have been to refine this stock adjustment model and to explain changes in the desired stock. This paper, however, does not start with the stock adjustment model as its premise, but presents an alternative structure. The assumption of the stock adjustment model that may be inappropriate when applied to automobiles is that all cars are weighted perfect substitutes,5 i.e. that all cars provide essentially the same service, private transportation. An alternative view is that the services of new cars are considered by consumers to be qualitatively superior to those of used cars, thus new car purchases are not merely additions to the existing stock. Rather, they reflect the demand for a unique commodity, new car services, measured independently of the existing stock of used cars. This model will be called the "" superior goods "" model and will be compared to the stock adjustment model. In Section 2 the models are presented. First, the user-cost theory, to be studied in the context of both the superior goods and the stock adjustment forms, is seen to provide the price variables, rental prices, and to provide weights for homogenizing new",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a40_3ay_3a1973_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a377-390..htm,10.2307/2296457

Discussions of elasticities of substitution have primarily been related to comparative statics analyses of the derived demand for factors of production and changes in factor shares or the derived demand for commodities and changes in budget shares.3 On the other hand, discussions of the internal structure of functions have typically been concerned with whether a function of many arguments could be separated into subfunctions. If such separability is permissible, efficiency in production or consumption can be realized by sequential optimization. For example, in production decisions relative factor intensities can be optimized within each separable subset, and then optimal intensities can be attained by holding fixed the within-subset intensities and optimizing the betweensubset intensities.4 The purpose of this paper is to integrate the discussions of functional separability and elasticities of substitution. In the context of production theory we prove theorems which establish that separability restrictions on a function are equivalent to certain equality restrictions on the Allen partial elasticities of substitution. Since Leontief [14], [15] has related functional separability to the existence of sub-aggregate indexes, our theorems relate restrictions on the Allen partial elasticities of substitution to functional separability and the existence of sub-aggregate indexes.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a40_3ay_3a1973_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a403-410..htm,10.2307/2296459
2553,Review of Economic Studies,Efficient Estimation of the Reduced Form from Incomplete Econometric Models,['R. H. Court'],"1973, vol. 40, issue 3, 411-417",[],"For certain applications of estimated econometric models, such as forecasting, interest centres on the reduced form of the model concerned rather than on the structural form.2 In such cases it appears desirable to estimate the reduced form by the most efficient means available. A fairly obvious approach is to estimate the reduced form directly by least-squares. This method is computationally easy, but makes minimal use of information provided by the structural specification, and so may suffer from a substantial loss of efficiency. Another approach is to algebraically derive the reduced form from the consistently estimated structural equations. This is a method which has been considered in detail in an article by Goldberger, Nagar and Odeh [2], and makes use of the full structural specification. But, ipso facto, it requires estimation of the complete structural model, and this is something which an econometric researcher may not always be willing or able to achieve. Reasons why only some of the equations of a structural model may be estimated include limitations of data, computational difficulties, doubts regarding the correct specification, inadequacies of theory and the existence of certain nonlinearities. However, even an incomplete structural specification in general implies certain restrictions on the reduced form of the model,3 and an efficient method of reduced form estimation should take any such restrictions into account. A suitable method of efficiently utilizing restrictions implied by some equations in the estimation of other equations is the three-stage least-squares of Zellner and Theil [6].4 In the present context, use of this method requires writing the structural equations of interest together with any number of reduced form equations and estimating all equations jointly.5 This procedure is shown to produce exactly the same structural estimates as if the reduced form equations were ignored, but a new reduced form estimator results which is in general asymptotically more efficient than the direct least-squares estimator. When all structural equations are used this procedure gives identical results to reduced form estimates derived from the three-stage least-squares estimated structural model. When no structural equations are used (alternatively when the structural equations used are just-identified) the approach coincides with direct least-squares.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a40_3ay_3a1973_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a411-417..htm,10.2307/2296460

However, it may be the case that stability results are sensitive to the choice of the numeraire, i.e., to the choice of the market which is to be ignored from dynamical considerations. It is this problem which we shall discuss in this paper and in this sense, our discussion is similar to the one in [7]. One may argue, however, that in the real world, no choice of numeraire is available; the medium of exchange is fixed and the question we should ask is whether the system is stable with the medium of exchange as the numeraire. The fact that the system is stable (or unstable) for some other choice of numeraire should be of no interest. This type of criticism of the relevance of the study we are about to undertake is open to objections as indicated by Arrow and Hahn [1, p. 302]. These objections can be on two levels; first, the argument about the medium of exchange being fixed is what has been termed to be "" casual empiricism "" by Arrow and Hahn [1, p. 302], since our general equilibrium models do not contain any adequate theory of money. Second, in a number of actual situations there is a choice of the numeraire; an example would be the theory of balance of payments: whether to use the dollar, or gold or some fictional unit as the numeraire is evidently a policy question, as Arrow and Hahn indicate. We shall give conditions under which the local stability of the system is insulated from such a policy choice. We consider, first, a model due to Gale [2]. This is used to demonstrate that, in general, both Hicksian perfect stability and local dynamic stability are sensitive to the choice of the numeraire; however, as is well known, in the gross substitute economy, it does not matter which commodity is chosen to be the numeraire. Thus, the natural next questionis there some condition which guarantees the insensitivity of the stability results to the choice of the numeraire? It turns out that if the stability exhibited is of the strong type, i.e. the relevent matrix is quasi-negative definite, then any commodity could be chosen to be the numeraire. It is thus somewhat reassuring to know that it is for cases where stability exhibited is weak (in contrast to the strong type mentioned above) that results are sensitive to the choice of the numeraire. It is shown that the problem of sensitivity to the choice of the numeraire arises because of the possible lack of symmetry in the relevant matrix. For, if the matrix were symmetric, then changing the numeraire can not change the stability results. Based on this, we deduce a condition in terms of dominant diagonals which would guarantee the insensitivity of stability results to the choice of the numeraire.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a40_3ay_3a1973_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a427-433..htm,10.2307/2296462

Friedman'],"1973, vol. 40, issue 3, 435",[],"Abstract: The purpose of this note is to correct an error in my paper [1]. Under the assumptions of the paper, Proposition 3 is not, in general, true. The point at which the proof goes awry is in the use of the mapping Ω. Ω is treated in the paper as if it were a function (i.e. a point to point mapping); whereas it is in fact a correspondence (a point to set mapping). Ω maps points of the unit simplex into itself, using a subset of the Pareto optimal set to obtain the simplex. A given point in the payoff space may be the image of more than one point in the strategy space. Each strategy, s, which maps into a given point in the Pareto optimal set (i.e. which has a given I associated with it in the simplex), can map into a distinct δ in the simplex. Thus the Brouwer theorem cannot be used. While Ω is surely upper semi-continuous, it need not have convex image sets, ruling out use of the Kakutani fixed point theorem. Furthermore, it need not be lower semi-continuous, ruling out another route to the use of the Brouwer theorem. That route is to use the results of E. Michael [2], which establish that if Ω is lower semi-continuous, then it has a selection which is a continuous function from the unit simplex into itself. The upshot is that the axioms of [1] must be somehow strengthened in one of the ways suggested by the preceding paragraph in order to make the proposition true. One way would be to strengthen A3 so as to make the payoff functions quasi-concave on S. Then the images of Ω would be convex and the Kakutani theorem could be applied. An alternative, which I prefer, is to strengthen A5. Let T = {s | s ∊ S and τ(s) ∊ H*}. T is the subset of strategies in S which map onto the Pareto optimal set, H*. Thus τ−1 is a mapping from H onto S, in general, a correspondence; and, when restricted to H* it is a correspondence from H* onto T. The stronger A5 is: A5′ H* is concave and the mapping τ−1 from H* on to T is lower semi-continuous. A5′ would, of course, be satisfied if the mapping from T to H* were one-to-one.In that case, Ω would be a continuous function and the Brouwer theorem could be directly applied. As A5′ stands, Ω must have a continuous selection to which the latter theorem could be applied. I have seen no way to prove Proposition 3 from the assumptions in [1], nor have I found a more satisfactory method of strengthening them. The only alternatives not mentioned above of which I am aware are essentially minor variations of the two methods.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a40_3ay_3a1973_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a435..htm,10.2307/2296463

Salop'],"1973, vol. 40, issue 2, 191-201",[],"A great deal of attention has been paid recently to the micro-economic foundations of macro-economic theory and in particular to the derivation of the Phillips relationships from a study of the underlying labour markets. Following Stigler [12, 13], the methodology of some of these recent papers3 has been to study the behaviour of a worker searching for a new job in a labour market characterized by uncertain wage-differentials, vacancies and qualifications. Faced with this uncertain environment, the individual calculates a subjective wage-offer probability distribution for the entire market from his expectations of wage-rates and vacancies and then samples the firms randomly, stopping his search and accepting employment when he is offered a position at a wage at least as great as the "" acceptance wage "" which he had calculated from the wage-offer distribution. This "" acceptance wage "" has the property that the marginal cost of further search equals (or exceeds) the marginal benefit. An important deficiency of this approach is the assumption that workers are unable to distinguish between firms ex ante. Only after sampling the wage-offer at a firm is the job seeker able to characterize that firm as a highor low-wage employer. The job seeker travels around the labour market, sampling a firm here and a firm there and consequently, unless new information causes a change in his expectations, never changing his level of acceptance.4 Furthermore, the possibility that the job seeker will be given no offer is not analyzed although this aspect of the problem has a number of interesting implications. In fact, individuals are able to distinguish among firms ex ante, and they sample specific firms in a systematic fashion rather than just sampling the job market in general. Consequently, at every moment of time a rational job seeker must select a firm to sample as well as an acceptance wage. Allowing the job seeker this additional information on specific firms in the market and the extra degree of freedom in his search strategy obviously makes him better off, that is, he would be willing to pay a fee to be able to search systematically rather than sample the market randomly. Furthermore, his maximizing behaviour changes as a result of this new information. It will be shown that his optimal acceptance level declines with his duration of unemployment as he samples his best opportunities first and poorer ones later. It is also interesting that the criterion derived for rating firms is not merely an expected wage expression but one which also includes the probability of acceptance and the rate of time preference as separate arguments in addition to the expected wage.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a40_3ay_3a1973_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a191-201..htm,10.2307/2296647
2560,Review of Economic Studies,A Generalization of the Phillips Curve for a Developing Country,"['Franco Modigliani', 'Ezio Tarantelli']","1973, vol. 40, issue 2, 203-223",[],"The aim of the present study is to propose and test a generalization of the Phillips curve for a developing country which starts out with a substantial volume of structural unemployment and gradually works it down in the development process. The central conclusion of the paper is that, while an expansion of effective demand and employment beyond the previous crest gives rise in the short run to inflationary pressures on the labour market, it also induces an on-the-job training effect for the labour force previously excluded from the productive process. The resulting permanent improvement in the skill and competitiveness of the labour force thereafter reduces the inflationary pressure associated with any given level of employment. Accordingly, in a developing country, the Phillips curve can be pictured as a frontier which in the process of development tends to the left and downwards. This inference will be shown to be supported by empirical data drawn from the experience of the Italian post-war period. In this analysis we focus on the industrial sector on the ground that in a developing country the latter tends to set the pace for the entire wage structure. The pioneering studies of Stigler [14] and [15], Alchian [1], Holt and David [4], and Phelps [11] have recently laid the foundations for a new micro-economic theory of employment and inflation and stimulated a growing literature on the theoretical basis of the Phillips curve.3 These studies, however, have the common characteristic of dealing with a labour market close to full employment. Thus, like the previous work on the Phillips curve, they are directly relevant only to already developed countries. We propose to show, however, that the new approach and, in particular, the formulation of C. C. Holt can be readily generalized to analyze the labour market of a developing economy. Part I briefly reviews Holt's analysis. Part II extends its implications to a developing system. In Part III, the central hypothesis of the paper is tested.

2561,Review of Economic Studies,Applications of a Model of Endogenous Technical Change to US Industry Data,['Jon A. Rasmussen'],"1973, vol. 40, issue 2, 225-238",[],"Economists have generally accepted the proposition that technical change is partially endogenous to an economic system. Increases in the productivity of inputs, particularly labour, are effected by the responses of firms and individuals to the incentive of possible profits created by allocating resources to the knowledge-generating and knowledge-using activities of invention and innovation. It is hoped that insight into the determinants of the rate of technical change can be gained here by focusing on the links between inventive activity and on the character of the incentives which induce a firm to engage in inventive activity. An intertemporal optimization model incorporating links between the firm's level of research and development activity and increases in its productive capacity is presented. This model posits a production function for the firm consisting of the three arguments: capital services, labour services, and the (firm's) stock of technological knowledge.3 Increases in the stock of technological knowledge are derived from the flow of research services in the firm's employ. The reasons for neglecting non-research inventive activities are essentially pragmatic. First, none of the comparative statics implications with respect to research and development presented subsequently are altered if the relationship between changes in the firm's stock of technological knowledge and inventive activities is reasonably well behaved.4 Second, measures of other inventive activities and their prices are not generally available but data on research and development have been collected for a number of US industries. These data can be used to examine some of the implications of the model. Assuming that the firm's objective is the minimization of discounted future costs of production and research a number of implications with respect to the response of the firm's research and development spending to movements in input prices, research costs, and product demand are derived. These implications are examined empirically with a body of data for eleven United States industries for the period 1959-1966. This presentation is organized as follows. In the first section the essential features of the model and an exposition of the implications of the model are presented. Section II contains the empirical results of applying the model to industry data.

Among the many unpleasant features of inconsistent planning is that if an individual behaves myopically ("" naively "", cf.

This paper presents alternative ways of looking at intertemporal behaviour, and examines the conditions under which such behaviour is consistent.

Maccini'],"1973, vol. 40, issue 2, 269-281",[],"The literature on the theory of investment has expanded greatly in recent years. One problem that has captured the attention of much of this literature is that of establishing a theoretical basis for the investment demand function of a firm. As Haavelmo [7] pointed out, the static neo-classical theory of the firm, while it implies a demand for capital, does not generally yield a finite demand for investment. To resolve this problem, many authors3 have built costs of adjustment into the firm's optimization process in order to account for the delay that buyers of capital goods experience in adjusting their capital stock. Although such costs are certainly important in explaining determinate rates of investment, other kinds of adjustment delays also appear in capital goods markets. Specifically, delivery lagsthe period of time between the placement of an order for a capital good and its subsequent delivery-are also a salient feature of capital goods markets. Yet, the implications for the demand for investment of the presence of delivery lags remain relatively unexplored.4 A great deal of the empirical literature on investment focuses on investigating the determinants of investment expenditures. But the presence of delivery lags implies that time5 has elapsed between the decision to invest, or the demand for investment, which in turn takes expression in (say) the placement of an order for a capital good, and the expenditure to which that decision ultimately gives rise, since typically investment expenditures are made when the capital good is delivered. Hence, if one is fundamentally interested in the determinants of investment demand, it is essential that this timing distinction be coped with in specifying empirical models. Even when delivery lags are recognized in empirical work, however, they are introduced into the model after the theory is completed and thus their effect on investment demand is essentially ignored. The typical procedure' is to provide a theoretical argument to specify the determinants of the investment decision. It is then usually assumed that it takes time for the investment decision to be brought to completion with the delivery of the capital good at which time the actual expenditure takes place. But, the fact that",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a40_3ay_3a1973_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a269-281..htm,10.2307/2296653

General equilibrium models under uncertainty were first constructed by Allais [1] and Arrow [2]. The model tested is of the class formulated by Borch [3], on the basis of works by Markowitz [8] and Tobin [18], and developed further by Sharpe [17], Lintner [6] and Mossin [10]. The bonds used in the test are annuity bonds. These are bearer bonds in loans, where the loan is repaid by a constant amount per period in cover of repayment of capital and interest on the loan. A lottery is arranged before each payment date, in order to determine which bonds shall be redeemed by the forthcoming repayment of capital. The bonds not drawn for redemption then participate in the next lottery, which is held one period later. A sequence of such lotteries is arranged, until all bonds in the loan have been redeemed, and the full amount of capital in the loan has been repaid. An annuity bond thus has an uncertain maturity. Its probability of redemption on a future date is given by the repayment plan for the capital of the loan. The certainty alternative which is considered relevant to the investors is investment in Government bonds. With the market for Government bonds assumed to be in equilibrium, this property is used to take account of the time dimension of investment in the annuity bonds. The investors are then assumed to behave in accordance with the von Neumann and Morgenstern theory [11], and establish preferences over probability distributions of present wealth. Such a behavioural assumption was tested earlier in an experiment [15], and gives a reasonable description of investor behaviour.

2572,Review of Economic Studies,On the Service Flow from Labour,['Roger Craine'],"1973, vol. 40, issue 1, 39-46",[],"For some time economists have been perplexed by the conflict between theoretical labour demand functions which posit decreasing returns to labour and measured labour demand functions which display increasing returns. Kuh [11], Brechling [5], Brechling and O'Brien [6], Ball and St. Cyr [3], and Coen and Hickman [7] are among the economists who, in the recent past, have published articles in which the implied elasticity of output with respect to labour exceeded one. Naturally, the estimates troubled them. Most of them assumed "" labour hoarding"" explained the observed high elasticity. The labour hoarding hypothesis, developed by Oi [14] and Soligo [17], includes adjustment costs for changing the stock of labour. As a result, firms hold a buffer stock of labour which augments labour productivity in a procyclical fashion. There are a number of other explanations, however. Anderson [2] presented a model with cyclical demand, production of an intermediate product, and production hoarding that led to shortrun increasingreturns in observed labour inputwith respect to final output. Puttyclay models (i.e., positive factor substitution in the planning stage and zero factor substitution once capital is installed, see Allen [1], p. 282) can account for the observed high elasticity of output with respect to labour through a variable capital utilization rate.2 Ireland and Smyth [10] reformulated a putty-putty model (positive factor substitution at any stage) to include a variable capital utilization rate determined by a capital utilization charge. However, their assumption that the ratio of factor rental rates-the cost of utilizing capital to the cost of labour-can be approximated by a constant makes their results equivalent to a clay-clay model. In the labour demand function they derive, the coefficient commonly identified as the elasticity of output with respect to labour in a Cobb-Douglas function is actually a returns to scale coefficient. This paper suggests a simple generalization that helps bring empirical results into closer agreement with theoretical models for any type of production function. We separate manhours, the surrogate for labour in most empirical studies into two heterogeneous components, "" men "" and hours. Feldstein [9] hypothesized that increases in average hours may increase labour productivity more than proportionally. His cross-section estimates of a three-factor Cobb-Douglas function (average hours, men, capital) for British manufacturing industries tended to confirm the hypothesis.3 This paper uses Feldstein's hypothesis as a base. We derive and estimate a model that posits the service flow from labour is a non-proportional function of men and hours. The model displays the conventional characteristics of decreasing returns to men and capital, but it has increasing returns for hours. Overtime costs limit the long run demand for hours per man.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a40_3ay_3a1973_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a39-46..htm,10.2307/2296738

It is used to evaluate different growth paths; and it forms a crucial part of the long-run theory of the firm. It has been used to derive an aggregate savings function, a demand for real balances function and an optimum dividend policy for a corporation. There is no area in economics which cannot benefit from the use of optimal control theory. As a rule, economists have used the Maximum Principle of Pontryagin to derive optimal control laws. Cass [4] formulated instructions to a central planning board, which attempts to direct the growth of the economy in an optimal manner, on the basis of the maximum principle. In his expository paper, Dorfman [5] used "" optimal control theory"" and the maximum principle synonymously. The maximum principle is an "" open loop "" type of optimization method in that it yields an entire sequence of controls to be followed from initial conditions. Half of the initial conditions must be obtained from transversality conditions which imply the solution of differential equations. Given the high probability of errors in measurement, formulation and implementation, as well as the likelihood of outside disturbances, the overall system will not be stable unless the open loop optimal policies are converted to a feedback form. This is to be expected since the optimal path to the desired target is unique.

Research in this area originated with early work by Phillips [11, 12] who proposed a number of stabilization policies and considered the stability properties of the system when these policies were implemented. In particular he showed how different policies could generate undesired oscillations and even instability, in economic activity. However, his analysis was purely descriptive in the sense that while the alternative policies he considered were plausible, they were not derived from any optimizing behaviour. Since that time attention has shifted to more normative questions and to the study of optimal stabilization policies. One of the first authors to consider this aspect was Holt [7], who assumed a quadratic criterion functional and obtained linear decision rules of the type first derived by Simon [15] and Theil [16]. Recent advances in control theory have led to the development of new, more convenient techniques, directly applicable to this problem (see e.g. Kalman [8] Pontryagin [13]). As a result of these various developments it is now known that assuming a quadratic utility functional and a linear model it is possible to obtain the optimal policy as a linear feedback law, which is a particularly convenient form in which to obtain the solution. The present paper has two objectives. The first is to apply these techniques to the stabilization of the deterministic multiplier-accelerator model. This problem has been recently studied by Sengupta [14], although he appears to have incorrectly applied the basic theorem which yields the feedback law. The solution is given for the general multiplieraccelerator model where the investment function is generated by the flexible accelerator. While the general nature of the optimum solution can be readily determined, it is extremely difficult to investigate any particulars and to perform any comparative dynamics in the general case. However, the solution can be explicitly obtained for the instantaneous accelerator and accordingly this case is studied in some detail. The second aim of this paper is to introduce stochastic elements into the model. Recently, considerable progress has been made in stochastic control theory (see Wonham [18-21]). It has been shown that the quadratic utility functional approach can be readily extended to cover various kinds of stochastic elements and turns out to give similar linear feedback laws to those for the deterministic case. Some work has already been devoted to introducing stochastic elements into stabilization theory. Brainard [3] introduces them into a static model; Holt [7] includes additive disturbances in his dynamic model; Henderson and Turnovsky [6] introduce stochastic parameters in a somewhat specialized dynamic",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a40_3ay_3a1973_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a79-95..htm,10.2307/2296741
2576,Review of Economic Studies,The Effect of Market Organization on Competitive Equilibrium: the Multi-unit Case,['Fred E. Williams'],"1973, vol. 40, issue 1, 97-113",[],"A few years ago V. L. Smith reported a series of experiments concerning the effects of market organization on competitive equilibrium [4]. Three market organizations were explored in those experiments: (1) sellers making price offers; buyers free to accept offers, but not permitted to make price bids, (2) buyers making price offers; sellers free to accept offers, but not permitted to make price bids, and (3) both sellers and buyers making price bids and free to accept offers. These market organizations were investigated under the condition that each buyer and each seller could trade at most one unit in any market period. This paper reports experiments designed to extend Smith's work to the case in which traders may trade multiple units of the commodity in any market period. Because market organization (3) would present some procedural difficulties in the multiple unit case, only organizations (1) and (2) were investigated in my experiments. These two organizations capture the essential structure of some familiar markets. For example, as Smith notes [4, p. 182], the exchange process in most United States retail markets has traditionally been sellers offering merchandise at stated prices and buyers responding by purchasing the quantities desired, with no price bargaining. Reversing the price leadership roleallowing buyers to state price offers and sellers to respond with quantities-reflects the structure of markets such as the crude oil market and some food markets (e.g., food processors purchasing from growers). Also it appears that the behaviour of markets under organizations (1) and (2) places rough bounds on the behaviour of markets under organization (3),3 so I probably have not lost too much information by considering only organizations (1) and (2). One additional aspect of market organization differentiates my experiments from Smith's. In his experiments the bidding process continued throughout the market period, enabling the price bidders to alter their offers during a trading period. In my experiments price offers were posted at the beginning of each period and could not be changed for the duration of that period. This condition is a bit artificial since price bidders in real markets can alter their price bids at any time, not merely at the beginning of some specific trading period. Obviously, though, there is some short period between price changes, and it is this characteristic that I hoped to capture.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a40_3ay_3a1973_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a97-113..htm,10.2307/2296742

The conventional wisdom says that there is no difference between the two. For the money market coupled with the commodities market is exactly the same system as the securities (loans) market coupled with the commodities market (by Walras' Law).3 But this ignores one anomaly of the securities market (which is one manifestation of an anomaly noticed in a different context by Bent Hansen)4 and which is a key structural element in all Keynesian models. An increase in the supply of bonds in the Keynesian model creates an equal and opposite desire on the part of individuals qua savers to trade money for bonds, while it leaves unchanged the willingness of individuals qua money holders to make such trades. A special decomposition of the securities market results (which will be explained more precisely in the next section); this decomposition gives a structure to Keynesian systems which denies the importance of financial flows-and also differentiates in a real sense the standard monetary theory from a theory of the supply and demand for loanable funds. In general, this decomposition will not exist in money markets and is only present in the traditional analysis because of highly special assumptions or, more likely, because of a misrepresentation of the nature of the demand for money. There is, it should be noted, a difference between monetary demand and the demand for the standard commodity. For it is not the case that an individual is unhappy if he does not hold a precise amount of money, which is the amount of money demanded; rather, each individual has some rule of behaviour which, in the long run, in conjunction with his pattern of monetary flows, determines the average amount of money which he will hold. Although other types of behaviour are certainly possible descriptions of reality, standard monetary theory has pictured money as an inventory and the rule of behaviour governing the quantity held as an S-s policy. The "" demand for money "" has been taken to be the long-run average quantity of money which people with such policies and given patterns of",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a40_3ay_3a1973_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a115-130..htm,10.2307/2296743

Assuming a strong case in which all firms have identical cost functions, Ruffin [13] analysed the quasi-competitiveness of Cournot oligopoly 3 and clarified the relevance of stability conditions to quasi-competitiveness. Earlier McManus [10] noted the close connection between the uniqueness of the Cournot oligopoly equilibrium and quasi-competitiveness. Okuguchi and Suzumura [12], on the other hand, dealt systematically with the uniqueness problem. Their principal finding was that the stability condition as proposed by Hahn [7] and used later by Okuguchi [11] ensures uniqueness. In this paper we intend to analyse the quasi-competitiveness of Cournot oligopoly more thoroughly for a weak case in which differences in cost functions among firms are admitted. Frank [4], in his proof of convergence of the Cournot oligopoly equilibrium to the competitive one, has considered differences in cost functions. We depart from Frank, however, in assuming that there exist initially an identical number of firms in each category of conceivable cost functions and then we let the number increase equally in each category. This approach was suggested by the proof in Debreu and Scarf [3]. They demonstrated the equivalence of the core and competitive equilibrium in a pure exchange model in which they assumed the existence of an identical number of exchange participants for each category of initial endowments and the participants are then increased equally in each category successively. We shall find that the uniqueness condition due to Okuguchi and Suzumura also ensures quasi-competitiveness. Ruffin has shown that when Hahn's stability condition is violated, Cournot oligopoly may not be quasi-competitive. For our model, however, it is conjectured that when the stability condition is not met, Cournot oligopoly may or may not be quasi-competitive.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a40_3ay_3a1973_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a145-148..htm,10.2307/2296748

Prices are then considered as the main vehicle of information for a proper allocation of resources. The "" public good problem "" has turned our attention towards the case in which some commodities are consumed collectively. Following P. A. Samuelson,3 economists have realized that, for the provision of public goods, the price system cannot work in the same way as it is supposed to operate for the distribution of private goods. The distinction between the two types of consumption is clearly apparent if we consider how information on individual needs and wants is actually conveyed within the social process ruling the allocation of resources. On the one hand for private consumption, households and firms usually express demands at more or less given prices, these demands being directly addressed to the various markets. On the other hand when the budget of a public body is being discussed, the individual agents or their representatives must exhibit in some way their "" priorities "" among projects. Faced with a proposed programme for the institution, they must suggest whichever changes they would favour: more for schools and less for highways, or more for both at the cost of higher taxes ... and so on. By such proposals individuals or their representatives tend to reveal their marginal rates of substitution with respect to the budget under discussion. Hence, households and firms manifest their wants by quantitative demands in the case of private consumption, by marginal rates of substitution in the case of collective consumption. In order to formalize this distinction, to understand it better and to study its implications we must obviously not limit ourselves to equilibrium analysis. With respect to an equilibrium programme, and its associated prices and taxation rates, the distinction practically vanishes: both for private and for public consumption individuals accept the prices and tax rates as measuring their marginal rates of substitution and do not demand any quantitative change. Our concern must be the process by which an equilibrium, or "" optimum ""5, programme is or could be found. Our theoretical investigation may then proceed from either of two approaches. We may aim at being "" positive "", i.e. at describing the actual social decision process. Or we may pretend to be normative, i.e. to find a,process with interesting properties. I shall here adopt the second approach, because it is fundamentally much simpler.

2584,Review of Economic Studies,Expected Utility and Continuity,['Lucien Foldes'],"1972, vol. 39, issue 4, 407-421",[],"The theory of expected utility derives conditions in which an ordering > of a set P of probability distributions, all defined on some measurable space (X, 1), can be represented by the numerical order of the expected values J udP of some "" utility "" function u on X. The set P may comprise only the simple distributions usually considered in texts on utility theory, but may include all discrete distributions, or continuous distributions of various kinds, or perhaps all the probability measures which can be defined on S. The class U of permissible utility functions may also be defined in various ways: it may include all those for which the expected values are defined and finite, or may be restricted to functions having some prescribed properties, such as boundedness, continuity or differentiability. Professor K. J. Arrow [2] has recently proposed a condition of a type new to this theory, namely that the ordering be continuous with respect to a certain metric in the set P of distributions. Such an assumption reflects the intuitively appealing notion that distributions which are "" close together "" in their assignment of probabilities to events in X should also be neighbours in the order of preference. But there are various plausible ways in which "" close together "" can be defined mathematically, and the choice among them has radical implications-which can be far from intuitive-for the existence and properties of utility functions. The particular metric considered by Arrow turns out to be unsatisfactory in certain respects; but his proposal suggests an interesting general method, which it is the object of the present paper to explore systematically. The following general statement of the problem of the existence of utility functions is adequate for the present discussion; note that the structure defined in this statement, together with the stated properties of the symbols X, Y, P, 1, U, and Sy will be assumed without special mention throughout the paper:",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a39_3ay_3a1972_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a407-421..htm,10.2307/2296509
2585,Review of Economic Studies,A Paradox in the Theory of Optimal Stabilization,['A. J. Preston'],"1972, vol. 39, issue 4, 423-432",[],"In 1954 Phillips [11] applied the classical techniques of control engineering to the problem of synthesizing dynamic stabilization policies. Given the dual objective of control over both the dynamic adjustment path and the comparative static equilibrium level of a target variable, Phillips proposed inter alia a combination of proportional, derivative, and integral feedbacks for effective stabilization. A drawback of this classical approach, however, is its inability to provide a general method for specifying the simultaneous values of these feedbacks. Fox, Sengupta and Thorbecke (FST) subsequently used the calculus of variations to generalize Phillips' approach [5]. By assigning quadratic preferences to the policy-maker and formulating the control problem as one of dynamic optimization, a unique set of feedback parameters could, in principle, be derived through a direct search for an optimum solution. Now the application of dynamic optimization techniques is a significant step in the evolution of stabilization theory. Yet the policies proposed by FST exhibit some puzzling features. Their proposition that optimal policies necessitate unstable target solutions particularly excites comment. The necessarily stable policies prescribed by Phillips are to be replaced by "" optimal"" policies which render the model unstable and thwart the very purpose behind their design-the achievement of economic stability. This paradox is surely of considerable importance for policy-making but has attracted little attention as an impossibility theorem for the design of optimal stabilization policy. If true, a conflict between optimality and stability is a telling addition to Baumol's ""theorems for skeptics "", a set of negative policy prescriptions defining what policy-makers cannot do; and including the second best theorem and the Phillips proposition relating the dynamic sensitivity of economic systems to the timing and magnitude of policy, [4]. The lot of policy-makers is already onerous and all potential additions to Baumol's list warrant keen investigation before acceptance. This paper contends optimistically that the FST paradox cannot withstand close scrutiny-that there is no impossibility theorem for the design of optimal stabilization policy. Certainly, correct analysis still implies an addition to Baumol's list, but it is less stringent than that asserted by FST. The argument supporting this contention proceeds in three stages. In Section I, the optimal Phillips model used by FST is described and correct solutions are provided using necessary conditions from the theory of linear optimal control. This leads to a consideration of the alleged stability-optimality conflict in Section II. There it is shown that the paradox is untenable but with little perception of the logic whereby the conflict is avoided. Accordingly, Section III examines the phase portrait of the optimal system, clarifying the basis of the paradox. Section IV concludes, and briefly relates the underlying problem to the areas of growth theory, production theory, and filter design.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a39_3ay_3a1972_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a423-432..htm,10.2307/2296510

The exclusion of wealth from the utility function, justifiable in the absence of uncertainty, implies that the life time asset/liability plan is generated by divergences between the time profiles of human income and optimal consumption, the former being assumed outside the consumer's control. Given the standard "" hill-shaped "" time profile of human earnings, this will tend to lead to borrowing in the early years of productive activity, the repayment of these debts and further asset accumulation in middle age, succeeded by gradual dissaving through retirement until death. The close correspondence to reality of this aspect of the model is one of the grounds on which Modigliani and Brumberg justify their neglect of the problems associated with uncertainty. It is the purpose of this paper to suggest that the role of wealth has been underestimated by ignoring uncertainty and to propose and test empirically a model which allows the wealth decision an independent part in the determination of consumption behaviour. In the next section, the model is presented as it concerns the individual; an analysis is made of wealth effects under perfect certainty and the considerable modifications needed in order to deal with uncertainty are discussed. In Section III, a macroeconomic version of the model is derived and tested against UK quarterly data. This section concludes with a discussion of the results and a numerical example designed to illustrate the magnitude of reactions to a change in stock market prices. Finally, in Section IV, the behaviour of the model in a steady growth environment is demonstrated and the steady growth savings ratio is tabulated as a function of the rate of growth of real income, the rate of inflation, and the rate of revaluation of wealth.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a39_3ay_3a1972_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a443-453..htm,10.2307/2296512

Major parts of the increase in productivity come from investment in human capital and learning by doing. While the learning-by-doing theory has been well formulated (Arrow [1]), there is no theoretical formulation of the link between productivity change and human investment. The purpose of this paper is to provide such a discussion by incorporating the theory of investment in human capital (Becker [2], Ben-Porath [3]) into a model of economic growth. It is shown that for a simple form of a return-to-labour function the existence of nonHarrod-neutral technical change, when it is the result of investment in human capital, is a source of externality. A general result which relates the form of the return-to-labour function to the form that technical progress must take if externalities are to be avoided is then established.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a39_3ay_3a1972_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a455-460..htm,10.2307/2296513

2590,Review of Economic Studies,On the Tautness of Plans,['Michael Keren'],"1972, vol. 39, issue 4, 469-486",[],"That production targets in Soviet planning have more than a predictive role was first suggested by Holland Hunter, in ""Optimal Tautness in Development Planning ""[3]. These targets, as he points out, have a dual role: they are both predictive and normative. In the former sense they prophesy the outcome of productive activities. In the latter they aim at improving it. The predictive, or indicative, sense is the more familiar: according to it the target says how much will actually be produced. When actual production deviates from the target, as it usually does, we should be led to conclude that either plan or implementation were faulty. This is an unjustified conclusion if we bear in mind the output increasing role. If actual output in some way depends on the target, then that target should be selected that leads to the highest output, and this may well be a target that differs from actual performance. We may need "" hortatory targets . . . even though not all of them could be attained "" [3, p. 562], or even targets which are sure to be overfulfilled, in order to obtain maximum output. To paraphrase Hunter's quotation of Marx [3, p. 563], a development planner does not aim at foretelling the future but at changing it. The plan itself is one of the instruments of change which help enlist the people's efforts to raise output and further the task of economic transformation. Statements of the type made above are quite alien to the language of production and growth theory. In it, there is no meaning to the terms "" effort"" or "" exertion"" (which will be used interchangeably). Once the feasible production set is known, there is no way of expanding it, as hard as one may exert oneself, while inside the set any point is as accessible as another. A statement like, "" The frontier of production possibilities will only move outward rapidly if there is unremitting pressure against it "" [3, p. 565] makes no sense in accepted theory. On the other hand, Soviet economists often echo similar opinions: production possibilities are not given, but can be stretched with ingenuity and effort, and statesmen and columnists in the western world also sound similar sentiments. Exhortations that only harder work can extract some nation or other from its economic difficulties are quite common, and they make some sense to most of us. The aim of the present paper is to enlist the concept of effort and use it to clarify the role which a production target may play in raising production. A few further notes on Hunter's work must, however, precede the main body of the work. The presumed elasticity of the production set lies at the basis of Hunter's terminology. He calls a production plan taut if it places the target in a zone which can only be reached with a great deal of effort, if at all. Thus a taut plan is one which is likely to be underfulfilled. Its opposite is a slack plan, one that is so easy to fulfill that overfulfilment is assured. As described above, the degree of tautness relates the target mainly to production",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a39_3ay_3a1972_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a469-486..htm,10.2307/2296515

We shall use it here to explore the properties of the savings-income ratios in growing economies where there are two classes of people, labelled workers and capitalists. The difference in the savings propensities of these two groups lies at the heart of Kaldor's macro-economic theory of distribution [4], which was later elaborated by Pasinetti [7]. It was then taken up by writers working with neo-classical growth models, primarily Meade [5] and Modigliani-Samuelson [8].3 A closely-related topic, the relation between the savings-income ratio and the rate of growth of the economy, has been subjected to an exhaustive investigation by Farrell very recently [3]. Our purpose in this note is to show that under very general conditions one can demonstrate that the savings-income ratio of workers will be less than that of capitalists in growing economies. Thus a crucial assumption in the growth models mentioned above is actually a simple consequence of behaviour patterns that are consistent with steady-state growth.

2593,Review of Economic Studies,The Stability of the Competitive System which contains Gross Complementary Goods,['Ryuzo Sato'],"1972, vol. 39, issue 4, 495-499",[],"1. It is well known that the Walrasian tatonnement adjustment process is dynamically stable if all commodities are gross substitutes and if the matrix of excess demand coefficients satisfies the Hicksian conditions (Metzler [5]). The process can be stable under more general conditions such as when some non-nume'raire goods are gross complements. For instance, when the matrix is a symmetric matrix or a Morishima matrix, and satisfies the Hicksian conditions (Samuelson [9], Morishima [6, 7]), or when it is a quasi-negative definite matrix (Samuelson [9]) or a dominant (negative) diagonal matrix, the adjustment process is dynamically stable even if not all commodities are gross substitutes. If we consider the Morishima case as being representative of the systems in which all commodities are not necessarily gross substitutes, the matrix of excess demand coefficients, A, satisfies the conditions, sign aij = sign aji and sign aik.akj = sign aij (i # j). This means that if the jth commodity is a substitute of a substitute (or a complement of a complement) for the ith commodity, then the jth commodity is necessarily a substitute for the ith commodity. If the jth commodity is a complement of a substitute (or a substitute of a complement) for the ith commodity, then thejth commodity is necessarily a complement with the ith commodity.3 The substitute-complement relationships in the Morishima matrix represent, certainly, an important and ingenious step forward in the study of the competitive system with complementary goods, in particular, when some commodities are not differentiated in use. (For instance, the economy which contains tea from India, tea from Ceylon, sugar from Cuba, sugar from Hawaii, etc.). However, in reality the substitute-complement relationships may not obey these simple rules.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a39_3ay_3a1972_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a495-499..htm,10.2307/2296518
2594,Review of Economic Studies,CES Production Functions a la Samuelson,['Ashok Guha'],"1972, vol. 39, issue 4, 501-503",[],"Most measures of the elasticity of factor substitution for a n-factor production function would define separate elasticities for each of the n (n-1) possible pairs of inputs. At least three such measures are well-known-the Allen measure [1], the direct elasticity and the shadow elasticity [3]. Samuelson [4] however has approached the problem differently: he defines an elasticity for each factor which determines the behaviour of its relative share as its input varies. Thus, we have a gain in simplicity and economy: the n Samuelsonian elasticities are fewer than the n (n 1)/2 partial elasticities for n> 3, besides furnishing a direct index of changes in relative factor shares. This raises an interesting question. Uzawa [5] and McFadden [3] have shown that if all the partial elasticities are constant, they can have at most two distinct values, one of which must be unity; indeed the production function must belong to an even narrower class than this implies. The restrictive character of such a production function makes it rather unsuitable for econometric use. It may be asked whether a production function with Samuelsonian elasticities of substitution all constant would be any better. Prima facie, one would expect so-since it would be subject to only n restrictions as against the n (n -1)/2 constraints on production functions with constant partial elasticities. Unfortunately, this is not so. Indeed we shall show that for a linear homogeneous production function the Samuelsonian elasticities can all be constant only if they are identical.

2595,Review of Economic Studies,Some Notes on the Surrogate Production Function,['James McIntosh'],"1972, vol. 39, issue 4, 505-510",[],"If factor intensities are the same in all sectors at all factor-price ratios the technology can be represented by what Samuelson [3] called the Surrogate Production Function, a smooth continuous non-decreasing correspondence between the value of output per man, y, and the value of capital per man, j, reckoned at competitively determined prices. In that same paper he acknowledged Garegnani's claim that the condition of equal factor intensities was the only one under which the surrogate production function retained its validity. At Samuelson's suggestion Garegnani published his results [2], basing his proof on the one capital good case and generalizing. That might have been the end of the story except for the fact that this is not the only sufficient condition for a well defined surrogate production function. It is argued here that in certain cases multi-sector models may have surrogate representations even when different factor intensities are allowed. Furthermore, when there is only one capital good, the proof does not depend on the requirement of balanced growth or stationarity. First, some preliminary lemmas are proved. Then it is shown that when there is a single capital good and one type of homogeneous labour, both of which are supplied inelastically, the two sector Uzawa [7] model has a surrogate representation whenever the consumption goods industry is the more capital intensive. Finally, some of the problems that arise when capital is heterogeneous are discussed.

2597,Review of Economic Studies,Stabilization Policies in a Growing Economy: A Comment,['John Taylor'],"1972, vol. 39, issue 4, 515-519",[],"In a recent paper,3 Professors Stein and Nagatani (SN) have examined monetary stabilization policies in a full employment nonlinear monetary growth model. Specifically, they try to give a "" rigorous answer "" to the question of which should be the correct control variable of monetary policy; i.e., money supply growth, interest rates, or some other variable. The model used is of the Keynes-Wicksell variety (a name used by Stein to distinguish it from the neoclassical growth models). The method of stabilization is linear feedback control, where the money supply and/or the interest rate are regulated according to fluctuations in the proportional rate of price change. The method of analysis is to substitute expressions for government regulated money supply and interest rate into the model and see how stability is affected according to the Routh-Hurwicz ~r i ter ion .~ Three general policies are mentioned by SN (proportional, integral, and derivative), but only derivative policy is seriously considered on the basis that no other policies are more stabilizing or less stabilizing.' Using this technique SN arrive at several interesting conclusions, most notably: (1) regulation of the money supply alone cannot affect the stability of the model, (2) a combination of money supply policy and interest rate policy is necessary to affect the stability of the system and (3) using interest rate policy the monetary authorities can control the nominal rate of interest in the long run. These conclusions have obvious policy implications for the current debate over what should be the correct control variable of monetary policy. This paper argues that these conclusions result from (1) an inconsistent model which does not consider all equilibrium conditions and which has an unrealistic specification of interest rate policy, and (2) a restrictive definition of money supply control. By correcting these deficiencies and explicitly specifying the behaviour of the monetary authorities, we will show how the money supply policy alone can stabilize the system and that a specific interest rate policy is extraneous as a stability tool.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a39_3ay_3a1972_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a515-519..htm,10.2307/2296522

2601,Review of Economic Studies,A Production Function for the Repairman Problem,"['Kenneth Arrow', 'David Levhari', 'Eytan Sheshinski']","1972, vol. 39, issue 3, 241-249",[],"In this paper we consider the repairmen problem from the point of view of production theory. This problem, which has a large literature,3 can be described as follows. There are m identical machines which operate independently and which normally require no human care. However, at any time a machine may break down and call for service, according to an exponential failure distribution. Furthermore, it is assumed that there are r repairmen, each capable of repairing one machine at a time. The time required for servicing a machine is again taken as a random variable with an exponential distribution. If fewer than r machines are being repaired a failed machine is immediately serviced. On the other hand, if r or more machines are being repaired, the failed machine joins a queue and waits for service. The queue discipline assumes that all repairmen are working if a machine is waiting, but it is otherwise arbitrary. If we let x(t) be the total output produced at time t, then x(t) is proportional to the number of machines operating at time t, n(t), which follows a stochastic birth and death process. Our purpose in this paper is to study the limiting behaviour of x(t) over time and, in particular, the behaviour of the expected value of x(t) as m and r become large. We here prove that as the number of machines and repairmen increases, expected output becomes, in a way to be specified below, proportional to the number of repairmen or to the number of machines, depending upon whether the ratio of repairmen to machines is below or above a certain value. It has previously been shown, by means of numerical calculations [4], that the production function relating expected output to the number of machines and to the number of repairmen exhibits smooth isoquants (with continuous marginal rates of substitution). It seemed, therefore, that the random character of the production process had introduced smoothing effects into an otherwise fixed-coefficients technology.4 But, as is proved here, for a large number of machines, the production function is of the fixed-coefficients type. In Figure 1, the isoquant relating the inputs per unit of output is seen to approach an L shape as m becomes large. The critical value (the ray OA) depends on the parameters of the stochastic process, i.e. the average failure time and the average repair time. More generally, it can be shown that the sequence of output processes, properly translated and scaled, tends to be a limiting diffusion process, the well-known OrnsteinUhlenbeck process.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a39_3ay_3a1972_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a241-249..htm,10.2307/2296356

On the basis of a concrete model, a variety of examples has been recently analyzed and calculated by Mirrlees [2]. In these examples, the optimal income tax schedule appears to be progressive with a negative tax at low incomes. The optimal marginal tax rate is approximately constant in the vicinity of 60 per cent. It is not known, however, how sensitive these results are with respect to various assumptions of the model. In Mirrlees' model, individuals are assumed to maximize identical utility functions that depend on consumption and labour. The return to labour is assumed to depend partly on an innate skill factor associated with each individual. Through individual decisions, the distribution of skill in the population generates distributions of labour, consumption, and utility. Income taxation is then introduced in order to improve income distribution and social welfare, defined as the sum of individual utilities.3 In this paper we use the above model to prove the following result: if the supply of labour in the economy is a non-decreasing function of the net wage rate then, among linear tax functions, the optimal tax schedule provides a positive lump-sum at zero income, and the optimal marginal tax rate is bounded above by a fraction that decreases with the minimum elasticity of the labour supply.4 It may be noted that this result does not depend on any assumption about the form of the individual utility functions or on the underlying distribution of ability in the population.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a39_3ay_3a1972_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a297-302..htm,10.2307/2296360

Ryder']","1972, vol. 39, issue 2, 159-169",[],"We consider a stationary, productive technology which is described mathematically by a closed convex cone (see (T. 1) and (T. 3)). Labour appears in an explicit form as a factor of production. Free disposal of labour and commodity inputs is assumed (see T. 2)). Storage activities may also exist (see (T. 4)). In defining feasible plans we assume, besides the usual technological restrictions (see (F. 2), (F. 3), and (F. 4)) that population and labour force grow at a geometrical rate which is independent of time and of the level of economic activity (see (L)). Our criterion for optimality of consumption is obtained by discounting a stationary, concave, increasing and continuous utility of per capita consumption (see (U. 1), (U. 2), (4.1) and (7.0)). Section 2 contains some useful definitions and notation. The model is described in Section 3. In Section 4 we reformulate the model in per capita terms in order to simplify our notation and facilitate mathematical investigation of the model. The basic properties of the set of all feasible consumption plans starting from a given initial input vector are established in Section 5. Section 6 deals with stationary consumption plans. We show that, starting with a strictly positive input vector, we can approach any stationary consumption plan by a feasible one (see Corollary 6.3). In Section 7 we show that the class of all feasible plans starting from the same initial input vector contains an optimal plan (see Theorem 7.1). The last section deals with the problem of characterizing optimal plans, and is both of theoretical and computational significance. Sufficient and necessary conditions for optimality of a plan in the class of all plans starting from a given strictly positive initial input vector are given.

Sen [14] has shown that decisions for the two policies must be taken together and Marglin [11] and Dixit [4] have developed optimum growth models to indicate how these decisions might be made.

The earlier economists defined the concept of stability, and tended to assume it without giving a rigorous analysis of the stability hypothesis. Hicks [8] presented well-known conditions for stability, but in so doing failed to consider the dynamic process of price adjustment through time. Nonetheless, in a classic paper Metzler [12] pointed out that if all commodities are gross substitutes, the Hicksian conditions for perfect stability are identical to the conditions for stability in a dynamic sense. This discovery, brilliant as it was, turned out to be only a prelude to a more exciting theme. In later developments, it was established by Negishi 15], Hahn [7], Arrow and Hurwicz [2], and Arrow, Block and Hurwicz [1] that a competitive equilibrium is indeed dynamically stable for a gross substitute economy. Despite the central place it occupies, the assumption of gross substitutability represents a serious drawback to the stability literature. Although we can certainly dispose of complementarity of a technical nature often observed among several commodities by a simple process of aggregation, it is impossible to assume away weak gross complements without loss of generality. It should be noted, however, that the absence of gross complements is by no means a necessary condition for dynamic stability. Thus, the difficulty associated with universal gross substitutability should not totally undermine the stability hypothesis. This point, well recognized in the literature, is of course of little interest unless one is able to identify meaningful classes of competitive systems in which both complementarity and stability are present. This paper attempts to proceed a few steps forward in this direction via the natural route of extending the Metzlerian gross substitute system. We shall first propose three distinct, but closely related generalizations of the Metzlerian system. Subsequently, in Section III, these generalized systems will be shown to be locally stable even though they may include elements of gross complementarity. To indicate the extent to which the Metzler theorem carries through, we shall also demonstrate that the Hicksian conditions are necessarily satisfied for a particular pair of these generalized systems. From this, we can directly proceed to comparative statics. In Section IV we shall present a result of comparative statics closely analogous to the one obtainable for the original Metzlerian system. This result, far stronger than the one implied by the Hicksian conditions, will be seen to hold for a (different) pair of the proposed generalizations. To illustrate the nature of our concepts, a numerical example will then be considered briefly. Finally, in Section V, we shall discuss some related literature, especially an alternative line of generalization suggested by Morishima [13], [14].",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a39_3ay_3a1972_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a193-203..htm,10.2307/2296871

It develops various parameters in the neoclassical production structure with disembodied technical change to measure the rate of technical progress and provides some basic relations among these parameters. What emerges is that in the neoclassical version there are many ways to interpret the parameters of an invention possibility frontier. In particular, this paper argues that if the parameters are interpreted as the proportionate rates of reduction in the input coefficients at a constant rate of profit, the frontier corresponds most closely to the original Kennedy one. The paper then incorporates the neoclassical version of the Kennedy frontier into an aggregate model of economic growth. It is found that, if technical progress is factoraugmenting, the steady-state equilibrium is globally stable irrespective of the elasticity of factor substitution. This result differs significantly from those obtained in Drandakis and Phelps [6], Samuelson [14], Amano [2], etc. Thus the present model provides a case of induced Harrod-neutral technical change. It demonstrates that the problem of choosing a particular kind of frontier becomes critical in the application of Kennedy's theory of induced invention. Finally, some fundamental points on the choice of a particular type of frontier and the implications of holding a frontier stationary over time are suggested.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a39_3ay_3a1972_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a205-212..htm,10.2307/2296872

This discussion arose out of the paper by Professor Feldstein [1] which proposed an econometric model of dividend behaviour and described the results of fitting this model to data for the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom provides a good case study for such questions because of the frequency with which not merely the rates of tax but also the tax system itself have been changed. Thus one of the main aims of Professor Feldstein's paper was to measure the elasticity of the payout ratio with respect to a tax discrimination variable which measured the extent to which the tax system discriminated against the distribution of dividends. The current controversy is partly over the size of this elasticity, and partly over whether the model should be extended to include other variables; in particular, whether the threat of takeover influences companies' dividend policies. The basic model is that optimum dividends (D*) are determined by the equation",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a39_3ay_3a1972_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a231-234..htm,10.2307/2296875
2621,Review of Economic Studies,Corporate Taxation and Dividend Behaviour: a Reply and Extension,['Martin Feldstein'],"1972, vol. 39, issue 2, 235-240",[],"In my original paper [2] I showed that the equilibrium dividend payout ratio falls during periods in which retained earnings are taxed at a lower rate than dividends. Although this is contrary to much popular and political opinion, it is implied by qualitative economic analysis. A lower tax rate on retained earnings makes it advantageous for shareholders to save through retained earnings instead of by reinvesting a portion of their dividends. Even if future dividends are taxed at the same higher rate, capital retained within the firm has a relatively higher long-run net yield because these earnings are taxed at a lower rate until they are paid out. This effect on retained earnings is analogous to the effect on personal saving of substituting a consumption tax for an income tax. Mervyn King's two notes strengthen the conclusion that tax differentials influence dividend policy. Using a longer period of annual observations, a somewhat different data source, and a modified functional form, he also finds that dividends respond to changes in the differential taxation of dividends and retained earnings. The issue is now not whether tax policy influences dividend behaviour but by how much. King's estimate of the elasticity of dividends with respect to the tax variable (0-the opportunity cost of retained earnings in terms of foregone dividends) is about 04 in contrast to my estimate of approximately 1I0. Although I have no a priori reason to believe that the elasticity is of any particular size, I suspect that King's estimate is biased downwards. The first section of this note shows that my original elasticity estimate is essentially unaffected by adopting the nonlinear form suggested by King. I then discuss why his lower parameter value is most likely due to differences in data that cause an underestimate of the relevant elasticity. The second section considers the evidence about takeover activity and the hypothesis of a "" managerial "" theory of dividend behaviour. I have also taken the occasion of this reply to extend the previous analysis by considering the effect on dividend behaviour of another important aspect of company tax policy: investment allowances. The results of this extension are presented in section 3.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a39_3ay_3a1972_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a235-240..htm,10.2307/2296876

Essentially, their model could be considered as a method of accounting for the discrete nature of wage adjustments when explaining four quarter percentage changes in the aggregate wage level. In particular, under certain assumptions, it was shown that four quarter percentage changes in the aggregate wage level can be expressed as a function of regressors which are four quarter moving averages. The basic assumptions of their model were that wage agreements are negotiated- once every four quarters and that one-fourth of all such adjustments take place in each quarter. Further applications of their model of aggregation were given by Klein and Ball [4] and Perry [5], [6]. The purpose of this note is to demonstrate that the assumptions necessary for the minimization of the aggregation bias associated with the four quarter formulation of the wage variable are strong enough to enable us to employ a much less restrictive model. In particular, it is suggested that the wage variable be formulated as a one-quarter percentage change regardless of how frequently wage agreements are negotiated. Indeed, within this framework the basic assumptions concerning the frequency of wage negotiations",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a39_3ay_3a1972_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a55-59..htm,10.2307/2296442

However it is common, even in complicated problems, to discover that the basic relationship between the fundamental factors are simple. In the belief that an understanding of the theory of income distribution at its simplest level is a pre-requisite for progress in elucidating its detailed aspects, a model has been developed which contains the necessary basic features and within which the choices facing society are described in a precise manner. Our starting point is to consider the benefit or utility which a worker derives from his income and leisure. This leisure is determined by the time he spends in producing an outpus and his income is also determined by his output. Thus a worker's utility is a function of his output and we assume that he produces that output which maximizes his utility. His utility, output, income and leisure are then determined. The next concept we need is that of an individual worker's ability to produce. This will determine the time taken and leisure lost in producing a given output. The utility, output, income and leisure are therefore all functions of the ability to produce and its distribution in society will be a fundamental function in the model. For application of the theory to real systems it would often be convenient to define the ability to produce as the earning rate (per unit time). The point in the above description where society makes the crucial choice is in the income which it allocates to a given output. This choice essentially determines all quantities, including the magnitude and the distribution of incomes. This then is the central point of interest, and the value of the model which we shall use is that it will enable us to study the factors which might be considered in making the choice of the income function (of output) and to derive the consequences of a given choice. As an example of the possibilities, we can determine that income function which would maximize the sum of individual utilities. We would then have a system in which workers maximized their individual utilities with respect to their output and society maximized the total utility with respect to the income function. Another way of selecting an income function would be to require that the function be such that any changes would receive the support and incur the opposition of an equal number of workers. One might expect such a solution to be an approximation to that which would be chosen in a democracy. In order to illustrate the use of the model we shall consider a pair of simple functions to describe utility and leisure, and investigate algebraically the consequences of varying the income function. This again is done in a simple way by choosing a particular functional form with two parameters, variation of which varies incentives. One of these measures the lowest income in the society and the other determines the income function at higher incomes, that is the progressiveness of the taxation system. The use of the model for more",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a39_3ay_3a1972_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a77-86..htm,10.2307/2296445
2629,Review of Economic Studies,On Optimal Taxation and Public Production,"['Partha Dasgupta', 'Joseph Stiglitz']","1972, vol. 39, issue 1, 87-103",[],"In a perfectly competitive economy where lump sum transfers between individuals are not feasible one would like to see the government using taxation and public investment as a means of improving the distribution of income. When commodities that enter into individual utilities are taxed, the conditions for Pareto Optimality are violated. That is to say, in the absence of the possibility of lump sum transfers between individuals, maximizing social welfare might well entail the economy operating inside the utility possibility set. The question, nevertheless, remains as to whether one would like to achieve over-all production efficiency at the optimum. Put another way, one would like to know if social welfare can be increased by the government setting different prices to different producers of the same commodity. In a recent paper [1], Diamond and Mirrlees have addressed themselves to this question, among others, and have established the result that under various circumstances (e.g. that there are no restrictions on commodity taxation), one would require production efficiency at the social optimum. In their paper Diamond and Mirrlees assume that private producers face constant-returns-to-scale production schedules, so that individual utilities depend solely on consumer prices and the supply of public goods. In this and an earlier paper [3], we have been concerned with establishing exactly how robust that result is. In the earlier study, we showed that when there are restrictions on the set of taxes which the government can impose, e.g. when there is a maximum rate (less than 100 per cent) at which pure profits and rents may be taxed, or when two commodities must betaxed at the same rate, or when a tax cannot be imposed on the output of some industry, or when there is an over-all budget constraint facing the government then, even when all individuals are identical, production efficiency will not be optimal. In this paper, we show that if there are enough instruments, in particular, if the government can set different percentage profit (rent) taxes to different producers up to and including 100 per cent (but lump sum taxes are still not allowed), production efficiency is desirable even with non-constant returns to scale in the private sector. In a section of our earlier paper [3], we addressed ourselves to this question in the context of a single consumer economy. There we established the result that if government losses exceed the total of all rents (profits) from the private sector, then at the optimum one would want to tax all profits away (i.e. set 100 per cent profit tax on all private producers) and use distortionary commodity taxes to balance the government budget.

Dasgupta and Stiglitz [1] have recently discussed the optimum taxation of profits accruing to firms under diminishing returns to scale, and the implications for optimum commodity taxation and public production. Their main theorem asserts that, when the rents of different producers can be taxed at different rates, production efficiency is desirable. In the analysis of commodity taxation and public production by Diamond and myself [2] it was assumed that constant returns prevailed in the private sector, and we had supposed that productive efficiency would not usually be desirable when this assumption was violated. It may therefore be interesting to see how the new result can be obtained by the methods of our paper. In this way, I hope that it may be easier to understand the reason for their result. It also appears that one, possibly important, modification must be made in it.

2631,Review of Economic Studies,Liquidity Preference and Risk Aversion with an Exponential Utility Function,"['Errol Glustoff', 'Nic Nigro']","1972, vol. 39, issue 1, 113-115",[],"The plunger has never been a very popular figure in economic theory. Indeed, in his seminal paper on the subject, Tobin [4] introduced the portfolio behaviour subsequently termed "" plunging"" on one page, and spent the next few pages stating conditions which, among other things, preclude such behaviour. These conditions were: (1) that the utility of returns be described by a quadratic function, or (2) that the probability distribution of returns be a member of the class of two-parameter distributions. Feldstein [2] has recently shown, however, that the "" proof "" of the sufficiency of the latter condition depends upon a property enjoyed by only one such function, and, for the class as a whole, no definite statement about the convexity of the indifference curves can be made. In addition, a number of writers have complained that some properties of the quadratic render it a poor representation of a utility function (cf. [1], [2], and [3], among others). Thus, the rather queer behaviour of the plunger, once thought to be so easily ignored, appears to be with us still. However, this paper will show that undue concern over such behaviour is still unwarranted by producing a utility function which, like the quadratic, precludes the plunger while permitting the more reasonable forms of portfolio behaviour but which, unlike the quadratic, has satisfactory economic properties. We proceed by first defining the utility function and examinating some of its relevant properties. Expected utility is then defined and put into the proper form for analysis. Finally, the slope and rate of change of the slope of the indifference curves are derived.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a39_3ay_3a1972_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a113-115..htm,10.2307/2296448
2632,Review of Economic Studies,Disequilibrium Dynamics of Competitive Growth Paths,['Walter Perrin Heller'],"1971, vol. 38, issue 4, 385-400",[],"Are there decentralized mechanisms which automatically re-aim a competitive economy when it is headed for long-run inefficiency? This is the first question this paper will address. It is known, for example, that many competitive equilibrium paths are inefficient in heterogeneous capital models with no terminal date (Malinvaud, [11]). Recently, Hahn [4], [5] has cast severe doubt that efficient paths are ever chosen under competition when a heterogeneous capital economy operates with myopic foresight and a simple savings rule. Even when there is just one capital good in a Ramsey planning model, the long-run efficient path is unstable in the space of momentary equilibrium paths: if the central planner initially chooses the right path, minor external shocks cause myopically optimizing individuals to follow permanently inefficient equilibrium paths. (Samuelson and Solow [13], Kurz [10]). All of these models restrict attention to momentary equilibrium paths, viz., those paths which have savings equal investment, and labour fully employed at each moment of time. In a competitive economy it seems more reasonable to suppose that each individual agent maximizes his gains on the basis of his expectations about future prices and incomes. But this means that, except by chance, the economy will not be in momentary equilibrium, and so people's reaction to market disequilibrium must be specified. Once this is done, one can ask whether the economy is stable i.e., whether the presence of disequilibrium sets up forces which inexorably lead the economy to an equilibrium path. This is the second question we shall investigate here. In the model presented here, household saving (or supply of capital) is explained by the maximization of a single, infinite horizon Ramsey utility functional, subject to a sequence of budget constraints involving interest rates and assets. Firms' demand for capital is determined by myopic profit-maximization, which in this case leads to the same actions as would present value maximization. For all but a unique sequence of interest rates, there will be non-zero excess demand for capital. It is shown that in this improbable economy, all decisions about future actions can be made today, so that the model may be detemporalized. Imagine that the infinite number of Walrasian forward markets for capital at all future dates are in operation today. At this point, a critical distinction is made between "" real "" or calendar time vs. "" market "" or auctioneer's time. Real time is understood to be frozen throughout the analysis in the sense that no consumption or production takes place while the capital markets adjust in auctioneer's time. At each date in frozen calendar time, the interest rate is changing as auctioneer's time unfolds. The rate of change in the interest rate at any date is a sign-preserving function of the excess demand for capital at",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a38_3ay_3a1971_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a385-400..htm,10.2307/2296685

2636,Review of Economic Studies,A General Equilibrium Model of the Term Structure under Transaction Costs,['Gordon Pye'],"1971, vol. 38, issue 4, 447-455",[],"Simple, qualitative, general equilibrium models of the term structure of interest rates have existed in the literature for some time. In Value and Capital, Hicks [1] considered essentially a two-period model consisting of longand short-term securities. He argued that, on the average, the holding times of borrowers were longer than those of lenders. Borrowers and lenders, being risk-averse, would prefer to issue or hold securities of maturity equal to their holding time. This would give them a certain return or cost. The heavier weighting of borrowers toward longer holding times meant that in an equilibrium shortterm investors would have to be holding some long-term securities. For them to be willing to do this, it was necessary that the long terms in equilibrium pay a premium return above that available on short terms. At about the same time, Lutz [3] extended this same line of reasoning to the effect of transaction costs on the term structure. He argued that transaction costs, as well as uncertainty and risk aversion, would lead to a preference for a maturity equal to holding time. Shorter maturities would require additional transaction costs as securities were turned over to complete the holding time. Longer-term securities would incur additional costs in that they would have to be sold on the market rather than being redeemed at par. Preference for maturity equal to holding time in conjunction with a distribution of holding times weighted toward borrowers at the long end would require a premium on long-term yields in equilibrium. Much of recent work on the term structure has focused on the expectations' mechanism used by investors to forecast future interest rates, and on the measurement of the size of the premium. Of particular note are the studies by Meiselman [5], Malkiel [4], Kessel [2], and Modigliani and Sutch [6]. On a theoretical level, investigators have also dealt explicitly under uncertainty with the portfolio-selection problem faced by investors on the demand side of the model. The work of Tobin [9], and more recently Stiglitz [8], is of particular interest in this regard. The only attempt to formalize and extend the complete general equilibrium approach of Hicks and Lutz, however, appears to be that of Malkiel [4]. He derives the equilibrium term structure in a multi-period case for a given set of values of transaction costs and holding times. Also, under more general conditions, he uses a formal general equilibrium model to show how an increase in the supply of intermediate term securities can produce a hump in the term structure. Some of Malkiel's assumptions will be adopted here. The general equilibrium model developed here completely neglects the effect of uncertainty and risk aversion on the behaviour of borrowers and lenders. It assumes that they know with certainty the future prices at which securities of any maturity can be",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a38_3ay_3a1971_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a447-455..htm,10.2307/2296689

Beja'],"1971, vol. 38, issue 3, 359-368",[],"In the analysis of models of competitive markets under uncertainty, different approaches can be distinguished. One approach, typically dealt with in welfare economics, is the specification of environmental conditions that are sufficient for the existence of equilibrium prices, with all the corollary implications for the efficiency of the competitive system. Prominent examples of this approach are the works of Arrow [2], Debreu [3] and Radner [12]. Another approach, typical to the analysis of capital markets, is concerned more with the structure of equilibrium prices, rather than their existence. Under this approach, basic interest lies in the implications of various given assumptions about the preferences of individuals (e.g. risk aversion) on the relationship between various properties of capital assets and their equilibrium prices, which are initially assumed to exist. Such studies extend from the classical investigations, such as Hicks [6] and Lutz [10], on the term to maturity of “riskless” capital assets, to recent ones concerned primarily with the issue of risk, such as Sharpe [13], Lintner [9], Hirshleifer [7,8] and others. 1 The present study represents an attempt at a slightly different approach. We postulate the existence of equilibrium prices for capital assets under uncertainty, and then proceed to analyze the properties implicit in their definition. It is shown that some results can be derived without recourse to the way individuals make decisions, their detailed preferences or their subjective assessments of probabilities. ∗ The author appreciates the must useful comments of two referees. 1 For example, see also Diamond [4], Green [5], and Myers [11] - all using the same ArrowDebreu framework of uncertainty used here.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a38_3ay_3a1971_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a359-368..htm,10.2307/2296388

As a practical matter, our counter-examples merely extend the class of approximating distributions available to portfolio analysts. A more intriguing ramification of our counter-examples is the possibility of a viable alternative to the stable Paretian model of stochastic price fluctuation [7], [8], [2], [3], [10].

INTRODUCTION One would suppose that in any economic system where equality is valued, progressive income taxation would be an important instrument of policy. Even in a highly socialist economy, where all who work are employed by the State, the shadow price of highly skilled labour should surely be considerably greater than the disposable income actually available to the labourer. In Western Europe and America, tax rates on both high and low incomes are widely and lengthily discussed3: but there is virtually no relevant economic theory to appeal to, despite the importance of the tax. Redistributive progressive taxation is usually related to a man's income (or, rather, his estimated income). One might obtain information about a man's income-earning potential from his apparent I.Q., the number of his degrees, his address, age or colour: but the natural, and one would suppose the most reliable, indicator of his income-earning potential is his income. As a result of using men's economic performance as evidence of their economic potentialities, complete equality of social marginal utilities of income ceases to be desirable, for the tax system that would bring about that result would completely discourage unpleasant work. The questions therefore arise what principles should govern an optimum income tax; what such a tax schedule would look like; and what degree of inequality would remain once it was established. The problem seems to be a rather difficult one even in the simplest cases. In this paper, I make the following simplifying assumptions: (1) Intertemporal problems are ignored. It is usual to levy income tax upon each year's income, with only limited possibilities of transferring one year's income to another for tax purposes. In an optimum system, one would no doubt wish …",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a38_3ay_3a1971_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a175-208..htm,10.2307/2296779

2656,Review of Economic Studies,The Dynamic Effects of Fiscal Policy in an Economy with Foresight,['Robert Hall'],"1971, vol. 38, issue 2, 229-244",[],"This paper presents the results of a study of several related dynamic fiscal problems in a simple economic model whose distinguishing feature is that the participants in the economy are assumed to make plans by looking into the future. The competitive equilibrium in the presence of a changing fiscal policy is calculated, and compared to the intertemporal equilibrium in the absence of any change. Throughout, we use the term equilibrium in its Walrasian sense, to indicate that all markets clear. In every case, we calculate the full general equilibrium in the economy, over all time periods and all markets. Part of the contribution of the paper, it is hoped, is in suggesting some methods for the characterization of intertemporal competitive equilibrium. Except for very general properties-existence of equilibrium and turnpike behaviour-this area of study has received very little attention in the literature. Since the actual calculation of the equilibrium is rather tediously algebraic, we have adopted the following organization: In part 1, we describe the model and indicate some of its properties. In part 2, we present, without proof, descriptions of the dynamic effects of a variety of fiscal policies. Finally, in part 3, we develop the analytic method applied in section 2. Four fiscal policies are treated: a recurrent head tax, a consumption tax, an interest tax, and an investment credit. In almost every case, there are important anticipatory effects on the economy in advance of the imposition of the policy. Generally, the anticipatory effects help to smooth the jolt caused by the policy. For example, savings gradually increase in anticipation of the head tax, enabling individuals to maintain a smooth level of consumption in spite of the tax, although eventually consumption must be reduced by the whole amount of the tax. Even when the policy change causes a jolt in the real flows of the economy, as in the case of the consumption tax, the anticipatory effect is in the opposite direction to the jolt. It is also instructive to note how the competitive price system acts to cushion the economy against the impact of a policy change. This is most strikingly illustrated in the case of the investment credit (defined as a negative excise tax on investment goods). In a partial equilibrium analysis ignoring the effect of the credit on interest rates, it appears that no rational entrepreneur would hold capital goods at the instant the credit became available. He could escape the capital loss induced by the credit, seemingly, by selling his capital goods just before the credit became available and buying them back an instant later. In fact, however, the simultaneous desire of all capital owners to sell and buy back causes a dramatic fall in the interest rate, exactly large enough to remove all the incentive to sell in the first place.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a38_3ay_3a1971_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a229-244..htm,10.2307/2296781

SHELL University of Pennsylvania The basic result of Hahn's seminal contribution to the descriptive theory of hetero- geneous capital accumulation [2] is that the short-run-perfect-foresight balanced-growth equilibrium is a saddlepoint in the space of capital-labour ratios and capital goods prices. In the context of a special model, Shell and Stiglitz [5] show further that on paths not tending to balanced growth, price ratios become zero (or infinite) in finite time. If machines are freely disposable, asset markets cannot be in equilibrium on such "" errant "" trajectories. A recent paper by Atkinson [1] has pointed out some very special features of the Shell-Stiglitz technology, casting some doubt on the generality of the conclusions. In the present paper, we investigate the "" Hahn problem "" in the context of a more regular model of production, the "" quarter-circle"" technology employed by Samuelson in his study of joint production [4]. As in the previous studies, we find that the unique balanced-growth equilibrium is a saddlepoint, and on paths not tending to balanced growth the price ratio becomes zero or infinite in finite time. 1. THE MODEL As in [5], we study a one-sector, two-capital model in which a homogeneous output, Y, is produced by the cooperation of labour, L, machines of the first kind, K1, and machines of the second kind, K2. Assuming constant returns-to-scale and denoting quantities per unit labour by lower case letters, the production relation can be written as y = f(kl, k2).

2663,Review of Economic Studies,On the Existence and Optimality of Competitive Equilibrium for a Slave Economy,['Ted Bergstrom'],"1971, vol. 38, issue 1, 23-36",[],"A famous paper by Conrad and Meyer calculates that on the eve of the American Civil War, slave prices were about equal to the present values of the slaves' labor services. They argue that this is evidence for the proposition that ordinary economic forces, without political intervention were not likely to put an end to slavery. I wrote this paper when pretty much the only economics that I knew was 1) how to prove the existence of competitive general equilibrium. 2) how to calculate present values. So the paper does two things. It shows how to apply Arrow-Debreu type existence theory to an economy with slavery. (this involved some technical wrinkles that were not in the existing existence literature.) More importantly, it argues that the calculations of Conrad and Meyer showed only that capital markets for slaves were working pretty well, but were not direcly relevant to the question of whether slavery as an institution was economically viable. To answer the latter question, we need to calculate two things. 1) Does an infant slave have positive present value? [If not, reproduction would be discouraged.] 2) Would a freed adult slave, perhaps because of the better incentives and opportunities for free people, be able to earn more than enough on the labor market to repay his or her market price to a slaveowner. I investigate the latter two questions empirically. The answer to the first question is Yes .

The mean and variance of wealth are approximately sufficient parameters for the portfolio selection model when the probability distribution of wealth is compact.

2738,Review of Economic Studies,On the Concept of Optimum Population,['P. S. Dasgupta'],"1969, vol. 36, issue 3, 295-318",[],"
 The economic welfare of a community is affected by policies that determine both the rate of capital accumulation and the rate of growth of population. The optimum size of population at any point is time will depend on the size of the existing capital stock and the optimum rate of savings will depend on the existing number of people. Consequently, in this sense, a population policy cannot be developed without a concurrent savings policy. The criterion of optimality that will be used is the ma ximization of the total discounted welfare of all generations from now to infinity. The problem will be to select that rate of savings and that size of population at every moment which will achieve this maximum welfare if, in fact, a maximum exists. An inquiry is made into the existence of an optimum policy under various circumstances. An attempt is made to evaluate the consequences of various ethical beliefs.

2801,Review of Economic Studies,On Second-Best National Saving and Game-Equilibrium Growth,"['Edmund Phelps', 'Robert Pollak']","1968, vol. 35, issue 2, 185-199",[],This chapter highlights the question whether second-best saving is greater or smaller than first-best saving when given future saving is non-optimal from the standpoint of the present generation. The chapter presents the postulation that all generations expect each succeeding generation to choose the saving ratio that is second-best in its eyes. This somewhat game-theoretic model leads to the concept of an equilibrium sequence of saving-income ratios having the property that no generation acting alone can do better and all generations act so as to warrant the expectations of the future saving ratios. The chapter presents a comparison of this equilibrium and the first-best optimum. The concept and calculation of the second-best optimum is of interest even if that analysis does not explain actual national saving because society as a whole has no notion of such an optimum.,https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a35_3ay_3a1968_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a185-199..htm,10.2307/2296547

Goods are produced from labor and other goods by a set of specified activities. Given an initial supply of goods and amounts of labor, all possible production programs running from the present time to infinity through discrete time periods are considered. With each program is associated a utility sequence measuring the satisfaction achieved by the program at each period of time. A program is optimal if its utility sequence overtakes all other such sequences. The paper is devoted to proving the existence of optimal programs for a wide class of economies and to deriving the properties of such programs. In particular it is shown that the optimal program approaches a certain balanced program. Essential use is made of the existence of an infinite sequence of optimal prices with respect to which the optimal program is one which maximizes the sum of profit and utility at each time period.

Sen'],"1966, vol. 33, issue 4, 361-371",[],"Two methods of income distribution have been particularly associated with socialist thinking, "" to each according to his needs "" and "" to each according to his work "". In the literature on socialism it is the latter system that has been mostly studied. Marx felt the former system to be appropriate only at the "" higher phase of the communist society,"" and emphasized the principle of distribution "" proportional to the amount of labour they contribute "", in the "" first phase "" of the communist society.2 While discussions in the Marxist literature have concentrated mainly on distribution according to work, in particular on the utilisation of the wage system, actuat methods of payments in socialist economies have often departed from this rule, the most notable example of this being in Chinese agriculture. On the other plane of discussion, in the theoretical literature on resource allocation with decentralized planning, the emphasis has been on reaching Pareto-optimality, and that, with the usual assumptions, has been found to fit in well with a wage system.3 There have of course been discussions on correcting the distribution according to work towards the goal of distribution according to needs through a set of taxes and subsidies, but the basic method of payment that has been considered has always been some variant or other of the wage system. The actual organization of enterprises in communist countries tend to depart from a pure wage system in at least two different ways: (i) in the use of some variant of profitsharing over and above a wage system,4 and (ii) in having a part of the income distributed on some criteria other than that of work, e.g. some interpretation of "" needs "".5 There is not yet a distinct body of literature on the theory of non-wage allocation of labour; nevertheless, in the context of policy debates, the following questions have repeatedly cropped up. (1) What are the difficulties in having a system of distribution purely according to needs? While in the U.S.S.R. and in Eastern Europe there has not been any large-scale attempt to have payments primarily according to needs, the Chinese leaders have tried to break through the problem of incentives involved in this, and it has even been claimed that "" ideally, the party leaders would like non-material incentives to become the main motive force impelling the masses on to greater output .6 (2) What difficulties are there in having a system of distribution purely according to work, even profits being shared on that basis?

2863,Review of Economic Studies,On the Adjustment Time in Neo-classical Growth Models,['K. Sato'],"1966, vol. 33, issue 3, 263-268",[],"1. A typical neo-classical growth model is characterized by the economy's long-run convergence to the steady-state growth path. An important practical question is how long is this long run, i.e. how much time is required for the economy to arrive within a reasonable vicinity of the equilibrium growth path from any initial disturbance? Professor Ryuzo Sato ([7], [8]) has shown that it may take a hundred years to cover the preponderant portion, say 90 per cent, of the disturbance. He concludes from this finding that any policy prescriptions, e.g. those of fiscal policy, derived from neo-classical growth models have very little practical content and that the Harrod-Domar model with fixed coefficients may be a better approximation of reality. In a recent survey of growth literature ([3], p. 812), Hahn and Matthews state that "" insofar as it [Sato's finding] is generally valid * . . it means that steady-solutions are likely to be of very limited value as an approximation to reality "", though they caution that "" this conclusion will have to be tested for a variety of models before its significance can be properly judged "". 2. This note shows that the conclusion above is not generally valid. Indeed, the adjustment time responds very sensitively to realistic modifications of the neo-classical model. These modifications refer to explicit recognition of depreciation of capital and of technical improvements embodied in new investment and the saving behaviour underlying the model. Then, the adjustment time at issue may be reduced by as much as threequarters. (It may be noted that the model analyzed in [7] and [8] defines output and investment in net terms and excludes the embodied type of technical progress from consideration.) We, therefore, conclude that it is too premature to abandon neo-classical models for analytical purposes including policy diagnosis. 3. As the model is very familiar, we need few words on it. We examine a perfectly competitive economy producing output Y (gross of depreciation) from two inputs, capital and labour. Labour (L) is fully employed and grows at a constant percentage rate n, i.e.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a33_3ay_3a1966_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a263-268..htm,10.2307/2974420

The secondary purpose is to discuss various models of technical progress. That there might exist a Golden Rule for research is not surprising since research is a kind of investment -n investment in technology -- just as ""accumulation"" denotes investment in tangible capital. Nevertheless ""capital"" and ""technology"" differ in important aspects. If, given the technology, the production of commodities is homogeneous of degree one in labor and capital goods, as is frequently postulated, then production cannot be homogeneous of degree one in labor, capital and ""technology"" (or the appropriate index of past research effort). Further, the production of technical progress, unlike the production of investment goods, seems unlikely to exhibit constant returns to scale in capital and labor, given the technology. Hence technology cannot be treated as an ordinary capital good. Because of this novelty that our subject presents, this paper must be highly tentative and conjectural.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a33_3ay_3a1966_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a133-145..htm,10.2307/2974437

2881,Review of Economic Studies,"Interest Rates, Forced Saving, and Prices in the Long Run",['Jürg Niehans'],"1965, vol. 32, issue 4, 327-338",[],"Introduction The main teaching of economics about the influence of interest rates on prices can be summarized in the proposition that cheap money makes dear bread. More precisely this may be interpreted to mean that if the level of interest rates is determined exogenously by the monetary authorities, any lowering of this level will make the development of prices more inflationary (or less deflationary) than it would have been at the old level. In mathematical terms this can be expressed by saying that the derivative of the rate of price change with respect to the rate of interest is negative. This general proposition will, for the purpose of this paper, be called the"" classical"" doctrine. Though seldom precisely stated or analyzed, it is probably one of the most universally accepted propositions of economics. Outside the economic profession, however, things are different. In particular, one often finds the argument that the classical doctrine, while valid in the short run, may be invalid in the long run. To the best of my knowledge, this argument has never been analyzed in detail. The present paper thus addresses itself to the question whether in the long-run context of economic growth lower interest rates might conceivably lead to lower prices. The causal chain from interest rates to prices may involve many different elements, some of which have been discussed in recent contributions, particularly by Solow [9], Tobin [11], and Hahn [3].1 Looking back on the long history of the classical doctrine one finds, however, that a dominant role was traditionally accorded to what was often called"" forced saving"".2 It is on this element that the present paper will focus attention, while other mechanisms, interesting and important as they may be, are left out of account. It will be shown that in the long run the effect of interest rates on prices by way of forced savings may be the opposite from what the classical doctrine asserts. Classical assumptions may thus lead to unclassical results."" The argument will be developed in four stages. The problem is first considered in the context of a stationary model in which investment has no capacity effects. It may fairly be called a Wicksell-type model. In the second model there is still no growth, but the capacity effects of investment now become important. Since it was Cassel who emphasized these effects, it may be said to be a Cassel-type model. The stage of Solow-type models is reached with the introduction of long-range growth at an exogenously given rate. In the fourth section the growth of the labor force will finally be considered as endogenous, its rate being determined in a Malthusian fashion by per capital real income. It will be seen that each of these changes in the underlying"" vision"" of the process has important consequences for the long-run effect of interest rates on prices. I. The Wicksell-Type Model: Stationary Economy without Capacity Effects Wicksell may be called the leading protagonist of the classical doctrine in modern economics. His position can be summarized in the following two statements:",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a32_3ay_3a1965_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a327-338..htm,10.2307/2295839

However, since our primary concern is with economic planning in underdeveloped countries, we shall depart with respect to one important point from the two-sector growth model as formulated in (3, 6, 8) which is, in general, concerned with an economy with fairly advanced technology and relatively abundant capital; namely, we shall postulate that a certain quantity of consumers' goods (per capita) is required to sustain a given rate of population growth. This restraint becomes ineffective for an economy with relatively abundant capital; however, for an economy with low capital-labor ratio and high rate of population growth, it results in the phenomenon frequently referred to as the vicious circle of poverty. In the course of the discussion below on optimal growth, we shall briefly investigate the existence of such a vicious circle and its implications upon patterns of optimal growth.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a31_3ay_3a1964_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a1-24..htm,10.2307/2295932

The interesting aspect of this relation is that—by utilizing the Keynesian concepts of income determination by effective demand and of investment as a variable independent of consumption and savings—it gives a neat and modern content to the deep-rooted old Classical idea of a certain connection between distribution of income and capital accumulation. In this sense, it represents a break with the hundred-year-old tradition of marginal theory, and it is no wonder that it has immediately become the target of attacks and eulogies of such strongly emotional character. Approval and rejection have almost invariably coincided with the commentators’ marginalistic or nonmarginalistic view.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a29_3ay_3a1962_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a267-279..htm,10.2307/2296303

2980,Review of Economic Studies,A New Model of Economic Growth,"['Nicholas Kaldor', 'James Mirrlees']","1962, vol. 29, issue 3, 174-192",[],"The purpose of this paper is to present a “Keynesian” model of economic growth which is an amended version of previous attempts put forward by one of the authors in three former publications.1 This new theory differs from earlier theories mainly in the following respects: 
 
(1) 
 
it gives more explicit recognition to the fact that technical progress is infused into the economic system through the creation of new equipment, which depends on current (gross) investment expenditure. Hence the “technical progress function” has been re-defined so as to exhibit a relationship between the rate of change of gross (fixed) investment per operative and the rate of increase in labour productivity on newly installed equipment; 
 
 
 
 
(2) 
 
it takes explicit account of obsolescence, caused by the fact that the profitability of plant and equipment of any particular “ vintage ” must continually diminish in time owing to the competition of equipment of superior efficiency installed at subsequent dates; and it assumes that this continuing obsolescence is broadly foreseen by entrepreneurs who take it into account in framing their investment decision. The model also assumes that, irrespective of whether plant and equipment has a finite physical life-time or not, its operative life-time is determined by a complex of economic factors which govern the rate of obsolescence, and not by physical wear and tear; 
 
 
 
 
(3) 
 
in accordance with this, the behavioural assumptions concerning the investors’ attitudes to uncertainty in connection with investment decisions and which arc set out below, differ in important respects from those made in the earlier models; 
 
 
 
 
(4) 
 
account is also taken, in the present model, of the fact that some proportion of the existing stock of equipment disappears each year through physical causes—accidents, fire, explosions, etc.—and this gives rise to some “ radioactive ” physical depreciation in addition to obsolescence; 
 
 
 
 
(5) 
 
since, under continuous technical progress and obsolescence, there is no way of measuring the “ stock of capital ” (measurement in terms of the historical cost of the surviving capital equipment is irrelevant; in terms of historical cost less accrued “ obsolescence ” is question-begging, since the allowance for obsolescence, unlike the charge for physical wear and tear etc., depends on the share of profits, the rate of growth, etc., and cannot therefore be determined independently of all other relations), the model avoids the notion of a quantity of capital, and its corollary, the rate of capital accumulation, as variables of the system; it operates solely with the value of current gross investment (gross (fixed) capital expenditure per unit of time) and its rate of change in time. The macro-economic notions of income, income per head, etc., on the the other hand are retained.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a29_3ay_3a1962_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a174-192..htm,10.2307/2295953

Such an analysis leans heavily on the tools of modern linear and more general programming and might therefore be called neo-neo-classical. It takes the view that if we are to understand the trends in how incomes are distributed among different kinds of labor and different kinds of property owners, both in the aggregate and in the detailed composition, then studies of changing technologies, human and natural resources availabilities, taste patterns, and all the other matters of microeconomics are likely to be very important.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a29_3ay_3a1962_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a193-206..htm,10.2307/2295954

It has become customary to assume that all the firms producing any commodity must be in full equilibrium when the output of the commodity is itself in long-period equilibrium. As a result the concept of long-period equilibrium output has long lost any close touch with reality. It is not difficult to discover industries3 which appear to be in long-period equilibrium, in the sense that their price and output have been reasonably constant for a long time, although these industries are not in equilibrium in the sense that all their component firms are in full long-period equilibrium. What we often observe when we look at an industry is a group of firms, some of which are growing, some declining, some stationary, whose numbers are being augmented by new entry and reduced by the exit of existing firms. A theory which could capture this aspect of reality would clearly be a considerable gain.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a29_3ay_3a1961_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a51-61..htm,10.2307/2296182

In particular, the motivation of the trader who undertakes hedging activities, the role that hedging plays in his over-all market operations, and the distinction between a trader who hedges and one who speculates have given rise to difficulties in the literature. My purposes here are (1) to outline briefly the purposes and mechanics of a commodity futures market, (2) to discuss and appraise the theory of hedging and speculation as it exists today, (3) to present a reformulated concept of hedging, and (4) to construct a model that may both assist in clarifying the concepts of hedging and speculation and contribute to a better understanding of certain market phenomena.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a27_3ay_3a1960_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a139-151..htm,10.2307/2296076

Upon examination, it would appear that the authors have been rediscovering, in some of the many guises given it by various specific problems, a single general theorem. This theorem forms the core of what may be called The General Theory of Second Best. Although the main principles of the theory of second best have undoubtedly gained wide acceptance, no general statement of them seems to exist. Furthermore, the principles often seem to be forgotten in the context of specific problems and, when they are rediscovered and stated in the form pertinent to some problem, this seems to evoke expressions of surprise and doubt rather than of immediate agreement and satisfaction at the discovery of yet another application of the already accepted generalizations.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a24_3ay_3a1956_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a11-32..htm,10.2307/2296233

3142,Review of Economic Studies,The Production function and the Theory of Capital,['Robert Solow'],"1955, vol. 23, issue 2, 101-108",[],"The dominance in neo-classical economic teaching of the concept of a production function, in which the relative prices of the factors of production are exhibited as a function of the ratio in which they are employed in a given state of technical knowledge, has had an enervating effect upon the development of the subject, for by concentrating upon the question of the proportions of factors it has distracted attention from the more difficult but more rewarding questions of the influences governing the supplies of the factors and of the causes and consequences of changes in technical knowledge. Moreover, the production function has been a powerful instrument of miseducation. The student of economic theory is taught to write 0 f f (L, C) where L is a quantity of labour, C a quantity of capital and 0 a rate of output of commodities.' He is instructed to assume all workers alike, and to measure L in man-hours of labour; he is told something about the index-number problem involved in choosing a unit of output ; and then he is hurried on to the next question, in the hope that he will forget to ask in what units C is measured. Before ever he does ask, he has become a professor, and so sloppy habits of thought are handed on from one generation to the next. The question is certainly not an easy one to answer. The capital in existence at any moment may be treated simply as "" part of the environment in which labour works.""2 We then have a production function in terms of labour alone. This is the right procedure for the short period within which the supply of concrete capital goods does not alter, but outside the short period it is a very weak line to take, for it means that we cannot distinguish a change in the stock of capital (which can be made over the long run by accumulation) from a change in the weather (an act of God). We may look upon a stock of capital as the specific list of all the goods in existence at any moment (including work-in-progress in the pipe lines of production). But this again is of no use outside the strict bounds of the short period, for any change in the ratio of capital to labour involves a re-organisation of methods of production and requires a change in the shapes, sizes and specifications of many or all the goods appearing in the original list. 3 As soon as we leave the short period, however, a host of difficulties appear. Should capital be valued according to its future earning power or its past costs ? When we know the future expected rate of output associated with a certain capital good, and expected future prices and costs, then, if we are given a rate of interest, we can value the capital good as a discounted stream of future profit which it will earn. But to do so, we have to begin by taking the rate of interest as given, whereas the main purpose of the production function is to show how wages and the rate of interest (regarded as the wages of capital) are determined by technical conditions and the factor ratio.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a23_3ay_3a1955_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a101-108..htm,10.2307/2296293

The first is to fill a gap by presenting a consistent theory of block tariffs; the second is to dispel some misconceptions found in the works of standard authors concerning this form of pricing. The main misconceptions here discussed are three in number: first, that the extent to which the consumer's surplus can be exploited depends on the number of blocks; second, that a lower price is necessarily ineffective if it occurs at a quantity which is larger than what the consumer would have bought had the price of the preceding block been valid throughout; and third, that block tariffs may prove inefficient in practice.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a23_3ay_3a1955_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a32-41..htm,10.2307/2296149

The dominance in neo-classical economic teaching of the concept of a production function has had an enervating effect upon the development of the subject. The neo-classical system is based on the postulate that, in the long run, the rate of real wages tends to be such that all available labor is employed. In spite of the atrocities that have been committed in its name, there is a solid core of sense in this proposition. The condition that the given amount of capital employs the given amount of labor entails a particular rate of profit. But the value of the stock of concrete capital goods is affected by this rate of profit and the amount of capital that was started with cannot be defined independently of it.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a21_3ay_3a1953_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a81-106..htm,10.2307/2296002

There is still, however, some confusion over what happens if other countries retaliate by imposing tariffs in their turn. Although Kaldor1 in his classic revival of the Bickerdike proposition, referred explicitly to the possibility that a country might gain by imposing a tariff even if other countries retaliated—a possibility which is also indicated by considerations of general monopoly theory—the possibility is often overlooked: it being assumed, and argued against the “optimum tariff” theorem, that once retaliation occurs all parties are bound to lose as compared with the free trade position. The locus classicus of this error (and some others) is probably Professor Scitovszky’s analysis of retaliation in his “Reconsideration of the Theory of Tariffs.”2",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a21_3ay_3a1953_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a142-153..htm,10.2307/2296006

3292,Review of Economic Studies,On Optimum Tariff Structures,['J. de V. Graaff'],"1949, vol. 17, issue 1, 47-59",[],"This is an essay in welfare statics—in the strictest sense of the term. It seeks to apply to a classic problem in tariff theory a tool of considerable power and generality forged by Professor Paul A. Samuelson in his Foundations of Economic Analysis.1 The tool to which I refer is a community’s “possibility locus.” Some of its salient properties are indicated in the first of the sections that follow. In the second I introduce a closely related concept, the community’s “efficiency locus.” The third is concerned with their application to the problem of determining optimum tariff structures, and discusses the argument—due essentially to Bickerdike2 and Edgeworth,3 writing at the turn of the century, but recently revived by a distinguished band of contemporary economists: Professor Lerner,4 Mr. Kaldor,5 Professor de Scitovszky,6 Mrs. Robinson,7 and Mr. Kahn8—that it is, in the absence of retaliation, always possible for a full-employment country to turn the terms of trade in its favour by imposing a “small” protective tariff on imports, and to benefit itself thereby. In the fourth section I examine rather critically Mr. Kahn’s revival of Bickerdike’s theory that the “small” tariff may, in fact, be quite a “large” one. A mathematical note concludes the paper. The treatment throughout differs essentially from that of Mr. Little’s article on “Welfare and Tariffs”9 in that the existence of no criterion is assumed on the basis of which interpersonal comparisons of well-being can be made.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a17_3ay_3a1949_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a47-59..htm,10.2307/2295788

3313,Review of Economic Studies,Central Planning in the Netherlands,['Jan Tinbergen'],"1947, vol. 15, issue 2, 70-77",[],"Immediately after the Liberation the Netherlands were faced with a severe
shortage of all essential goods, particularly in the Western part of the country, where
the period of famine had led to a complete exhaustion of all stocks, and where the
Germans had deliberately destroyed the railway system. At that time there was no
alternative to a policy of rigorous planning, approaching that of a war economy. After
the worst damage had been repaired and the shortages partially alleviated, it became
apparent that the pent-up demand (backed by abundant liquid reserves), was so much
larger than production and imports together, that an allocation and rationing system
would be necessary to prevent inflation. It was not a matter of principle, but the
compelling nature of the circumstances which led to the continuation of a policy of
detailed planning. Even now the situation in the Netherlands, as compared with that
of the other North-Western European countries, makes rigorous planning more
necessary than elsewhere. The combined effect of (a) war damage, (b) the loss of
income from overseas investments, (c) the chaos in the German hinterland, and (d)
the large increase in population, is affecting the Netherlands more seriously than any
other North-Western European country.
The primary object of this planning is to restore equilibrium between :
(a) Imports and exports ;
(b) Supply of consumers' goods and a tolerable standard of living for the mass
of the population ;
(c) New investment ; and
(d) The increase in population.
In the more remote future it is probable that the economic policy of the Netherlands
will gradually tend towards an employment policy which will use more indirect
methods of influencing production, consumption and prices.
It is the intention of this paper to give a short account of the chief features of
the present system of drawing-up the nation's economic budget.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a15_3ay_3a1947_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a70-77..htm,10.2307/2295994

(1) 
 
Goods are produced not only from “ natural factors of production,” but in the first place from each other. These processes of production may be circular, i.e. good G1 is produced with the aid of good G2, and G2 with the aid of G1. 
 
 
 
 
(2) 
 
There may be more technically possible processes of production than goods and for this reason “ counting of equations ” is of no avail. The problem is rather to establish which processes will actually be used and which not (being “ unprofitable”).",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a13_3ay_3a1945_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a1-9..htm,10.2307/2296111

Historically, it was the origin of the modern subjective theory of value (in the doctrine of comparative costs), it was earliest in emphasising the importance of demand in determining relative prices (J. S. Mill’s reciprocal demand), and it has provided the analytical tools, Marshall’s offer curves, from whose application to the problem of exchange between persons the general theory of perfect competition has been developed. Unfortunately, however, the analogy between countries and persons was considered irreversible. Our theory of the individual’s rational economic behaviour was not applied to problems of international trade because of our supposed inability to draw community indifference curves. Hence, we have no theory of the rational behaviour of a single country, and even less do we know what would be the result of such behaviour on the part of all countries.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a9_3ay_3a1942_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a89-110..htm,10.2307/2967663

3420,Review of Economic Studies,Econometric Business Cycle Research,['Jan Tinbergen'],"1940, vol. 7, issue 2, 73-90",[],"In recent years various attempts have been made to construct econometric
models of the business cycle mechanism.l Some of them are very simple,
others more complicated ; some pay more attention to the mathematicoeconomic
set-up, others give special care to a statistical determination of the
coefficients involved. The latter group is notable for, in particular, the model
by Radice of the post-war United Kingdom that by De Wolff of post-war
Sweden and my own attempts for the Netherlands and the United States.
As far as I am myself concerned, a "" model under construction "" is that for
the United Kingdom between 1870 and 1914.
An essential feature of an econometric model is, I think, that it combines
mathematico-economic treatment with statistical measurement of some type.
The 'ultimate objectives of these models are the same as of any system of
business cycle research, viz. (i) to explain historical events ; (ii) to forecast
future developments under certain conditions ; and (iii) to indicate the probable
consequences of measures of business cycle policy. Within the framework
of these ultimate objectives, one may distinguish more proximate objectives.
These may be separately stated for the economic and the statistical parts of
the task.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a7_3ay_3a1940_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a73-90..htm,10.2307/2967472

3426,Review of Economic Studies,Speculation and Economic Stability,['Nicholas Kaldor'],"1939, vol. 7, issue 1, 1-27",[],"The purpose of the following paper is to examine, in the light of recent doctrines, the effects of speculation on economic stability. Speculation, for the purposes of this paper, may be defined as the purchase (or sale) of goods with a view to re-sale (re-purchase) at a later date, where the motive behind such action is the expectation of a change in the relevant prices relatively to the ruling price and not a gain accruing through their use, or any kind of transformation effected in them or their transfer between different markets. Thus, while merchants and other dealers do make purchases and sales which might be termed ‘speculative’, their ordinary transactions do not fall within this category. What distinguishes speculative purchases and sales from other kinds of purchases and sales is the expectation of an impending change in the ruling market price as the sole motive of action. Hence ‘speculative stocks’ of anything may be defined as the difference between the amount actually held and the amount that would be held if, other things being the same, the price of that thing were expected to remain unchanged; and they can be either positive or negative.1",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a7_3ay_3a1939_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a1-27..htm,10.2307/2967593

3481,Review of Economic Studies,A General Method for the Comparison of the Price of Living,['H. Staehle'],"1937, vol. 4, issue 3, 205-214",[],"Two years ago this REVIEW published an article 1 in which I offered a method for the comparison of the price of living as between situations where tastes and milieu are identical, and which differ only in respect of prices. The present paper gives another more general method, which permits of comparing the price of living between any two or more situations that differ not only in respect of prices but where tastes and milieu may also be different. The problem of price-of-living comparisons consists in determining money incomes which yield equivalent satisfaction in the two or more situations under comparison. Its solution therefore requires the establishment of an objective criterion for the equivalence of money incomes. In the case of identical tastes and milieu the criterion used was the indifference of choice between them. Where tastes and milieu are not identical, this criterion can, however, no longer be applied: it obviously breaks down when more than one want system is involved. The present task therefore consists in finding another criterion which is independent of the assumption of identical tastes and milieu. Both from a theoretical and a practical point of view great importance attaches to the present problem on account of the fact that the question as to whether tastes and milieu are or are not identical as between different situations can of necessity only be answered by arbitrary decision.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a4_3ay_3a1937_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a205-214..htm,10.2307/2967455

3571,Review of Economic Studies,Pareto and Pure Economics,['Umberto Ricci'],"1933, vol. 1, issue 1, 3-21",[],"I AM delighted to agree to the suggestion of the editors of the REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES to publish a translation of my article on "" Pareto and Pure Economics "" in their first number. Vilfredo Pareto was without doubt one of the great thinkers of his day. He left his mark on many branches of learning, as a mathematician, economist, statistician and sociologist. My article was written for a number (January-February I924) which the Giornale degli Economisti wished to devote to Pareto's memory. It was concerned only with an examination of Pareto's work in the field of pure economics. To others fell the task of evaluating the remaining aspects of his intellectual life. Though written some time ago the article may stand to-day. Walras had provided a powerful synthesis of pure economics. Pareto, as Walras' successor at Lausanne, completed and refined the Walrasian system, giving to it a comprehensiveness it would be hard to surpass. Since Pareto's death some practical work, somewhat on the lines which hemight have followed, has been undertaken (cf. H. L. Moore, Synthetic Economics, and my review in the Zeitschrift fuer National Oekonomie, Bd. I, Heft 5). Such an attempt can hardly avoid heaping difficulty upon difficultv. The Walras-Paretian system remains nevertheless a very great achievement. If it cannot be applied directly to concrete problems, it is, however, a most useful mental tonic to the inquirer, keeping him constantly on the alert to perceive possible connections between phenomena and putting him on his guard against excessive particularity and empiricism. Such a combined picture of consumption, production and exchange is indeed a true work of art.",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a1_3ay_3a1933_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a3-21..htm,10.2307/2967433

3575,Review of Economic Studies,Taxation and Returns,['Lindley M. Fraser'],"1933, vol. 1, issue 1, 45-59",[],"READERS of Marshall are familiar with his doctrine (which has since his time passed into the corpus of economic theory') that the welfare of the community may be increased if taxes are imposed on industries operating under conditions of increasing costs and bounties granted to industries operatilng under conditions of decreasing costs. The argument is as follows. When an industry shows increasing costs, a tax on it will raise the purchase price of its product by less than the full amount of the tax; because the reduction in the demand will lead to a fall in the marginal cost of production. The State will therefore gain the full amount of the tax on all the commodities which are sold at the new price. The consumers on the other hand will sustain a double loss. On what they continue to buy they will pay the difference between the old and the new price; and in addition they will lose their consumers' surplus on the amount they no longer buy. But provided that costs are increasing sufficiently sharply the first of these three quantities will exceed the sum of the second and third, and the difference will constitute a net gain to the community.2 A similar line of argument is used to show that in the case of decreasing costs a bounty may lead to a net gain: viz. if the total gain to consumers (the amount of money saved on the quantity previously bought, plus consumers' surplus on the additional purchases) is more than the total amount of the bounty.' 2. We may express this algebraically as follows. Let the quantities consumed before and after the imposition of the tax (or the granting of the bounty) be x and xi respectively and the unity prices y and y1 Then (in the case of a tax) the loss to consumers in respect of what they continue to buy is x;(yl-y); and their loss in respect of what they no longer buy may be treated as being equal to the difference between the old and new",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a1_3ay_3a1933_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a45-59..htm,10.2307/2967437
3576,Review of Economic Studies,Profit in American Economic Theory,['William S. Hopkins'],"1933, vol. 1, issue 1, 60-66",[],"DURING the past sixty years, there has been a highly significant development of the concept of profit in American economic thought, generally unaffected by influences from abroad. The process of this development has given the term an entirely new content and new connotations which are peculiar to its use in the United States. Unfortunately for clear comprehension, the history of profit doctrine has usually been considered to be chaotic and disconnecteda mere series of mutually exclusive and incompatible doctrines. It is the purpose of the present article to show (i) that there has been a logical process of development in the history of profit theory in the United States, and (2) something of the nature and significance of the concept which has been developed by this historical process. The thread of the process of development is not to be found in any series of positive contributions, each new one adding to the accepted content of its predecessor. On the contrary, the various contributions are important chiefly as they subtract from a common beginning. The process is one of the successive refinements of a concept. The start is taken from the classical definition of profit, as exemplified by John Stuart Mill. According to his definition, which was widely accepted in the United States prior to I883, profit is composed -of interest, wages of management, and the reward for risk-bearing. In three successive stages, American theorising has rejected each of these component parts, leaving no content whatever to the old definition. The first important step in the development of this American theory was the separation of interest from the concept of profit which had been accepted by classical economics. Although previously suggested in a sketchy fashion by minor writers,' the greatest credit for this achievement must go to Francis A. Walker, whose system of distribution was unique and original, if not endowed with enduring validity.2 His system, briefly, was as follows: Industry produces a certain amount of wealth, from which each participating factor is entitled to a share. The landowner receives rent, in the Ricardian sense. The capitalist receives interest, the rate of which is determined by the law of supply and demand. The entrepreneur receives profit, determined by the rent principle as applied to the relative efficiency of entrepreneurs, measured upward from the wage rate which alternative employments offer to the least efficient among them. After these deductions we have but one",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a1_3ay_3a1933_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a60-66..htm,10.2307/2967438

3579,Review of Economic Studies,III.—The Elasticity of Substitution and the Relative Share of a Factor,['R. F. Kahn'],"1933, vol. 1, issue 1, 72-78",[],"WE owe to Dr. Hicks the extremely interesting proposition that "" an increase in the supply of any factor will increase its relative share (i.e. its proportion of the National Dividend) if its ' elasticity of substitution ' is greater than unity,""' and will diminish its relative share if the "" elasticity of substitution "" is less than unity. For "" much the most satisfactory way of proving the validity "" of this rule, Dr. Hicks refers the reader to his mathematical Appendix. Here is to be found2 a symbolic definition of elasticity of substitution which gives the appearance of having been dictated by the requirements of algebra rather than of economics, and Dr. Hicks fails to tell us what it really means, while in the text we have to be content with the admission that "" the case where the elasticity of substitution is unity can only be defined in words by saying that in this case (initially, before any consequential changes in the supply of other factors takes place) the increase in one factor will raise the marginal product of all other factors taken together in the same proportion as the total product is raised.""' The purpose of this note is to point out that Dr. Hicks' elasticity of substitution has a very simple meaning and to show how his proposition can be deduced by a very simple line of thought.' For, by a curious coincidence, Dr. Hicks' elasticity of substitution is exactly the same as Mrs. Robinson's elasticity of substitution.' Though Dr. Hicks was apparently unaware that his new conception was capable of so simple an interpretation, it is in fact "" the proportionate change in the ratio of the amounts of the factors divided by the proportionate change in the ratio of their marginal physical productivities.""' Let us now imagine a curve relating the ratio of the amounts of the factors (measured along the x axis) to the ratio of the marginal productivities (measured along the y axis).' Then it follows from the above definition that the elasticity of substitution is equal to the elasticity of this curve. By a well-known proposition the area xy subtended by a point on a curve increases as x increases if the curve has an elasticity greater than unity, and",https://econpapers.repec.org/article/ouprestud/v_3a1_3ay_3a1933_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a72-78..htm,10.2307/restud/1.1.72
