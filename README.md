# MACS30122 Final Project - Netrunners
## *Portrait of Economic Academia: Evidence from Top 20 Economics Journals from 2012 to 2022*
### Research Questions and Relevance
 * We form a whole picture of the current Economic academia by 
    1. identifying its collaboration patterns on Top Econ Journals through SNA
    2. research topics evolvement across time and institutions through dynamic TM.
 * We ask the following research questions:
    1. SNA: 
        - What are the network features and collaboration patterns at the institutional and tier level? Density, centrality, cross-rank freedom?
    2. TM:
        - How research topics vary and evolve across time and institutions? 
        - For each topic, who are the most important contributors?
    3. SNA & TM:
        - Do centralities in the network research the same topics?
        - For a centrality, who are parallel peers, who are distinct peers?
 * We have the following interesting findings:
    1. SNA: 
        - Top tier institutions are more likely to collaborate with institutions of similar levels; but for lower tier institutions, they often collaborate with those from very different tiers. In other words, an institutionâ€™s cross-rank/tier collaboration likelihood decreases as its tier/rank gets higher.
    2. TM:
        - Topics are stable in trends across time with some fluctuations but can vary a lot across different institutions.
    3. SNA & TM:
        - Centralities of university-institutions are relatively similar in what they research, but World Bank shows a large discrepancy against university-institutions.
